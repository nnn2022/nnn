    <strong>We are living in a Zoombie Apocalypse.</strong>
    <p><p>One of my very first posts here back in the day started off with me saying I have an extremely low tolerance for stupidity: so you can fucking imagine the time I've had throughout this past year and a half. I've been in a perpetual state of anger, frustration, exasperation and despair watching this shit unfold. I'm not saying I'm smarter than the average person or anything but how the fuck can you not see that this shit is FUCKING STUPID?! I am sick to death of being lectured on fucking everything from mush-mouthed morons who have probably broken the rules themselves multiple times because they're fucking virtue-signalling hypocrites.</p>
<p>It's just been a daily glut of fucking cutesy, narcissistic, "Stay Positive!" bullshit layered over the backdrop of a "deadly pandemic" to keep the fucking slack-jawed, Kardashian obsessed, "Live Laugh Love" morons happy and content and it fucking pisses me off to no end that people can't see through it. "Just stay home, curl up on the couch in your favouite fucking snood or onesie or whatever the fuck with your mug of hot choccy and stream "Contagion" or "Tiger King" or fucking "Cuties". Be sure to stand outside and clap like seals for the NHS! OMG have you seen the videos of the nurses dancing?! AWESOME! FUNNY! AND BRAVE! I LIKE IT, I DO! wE aRe aLL iN ThIS tOgEtHeR!"</p>
<p>I fucking despise it all. The masks, the vaccines, fucking Zoom, anything and everything these dead-eyed Zoombie fuck-sacks obsess over and virtue-signal about. Maybe I'd be willing to take this "pandemic" a bit more seriously if you weren't such insufferable cringe-bags about it all. Anyone that watches those videos of the nurses dancing or fucking James Corden or any other sell-out celebrity wanker shilling the vaccines in painfully unfunny, overly saccharine skits and music videos without cringing is not someone worth following or taking advice from.</p>
<p>World leaders flaunt the rules at the G7 Summit. Matt HanCOCK is caught on camera getting frisky with his aide, breaking social distancing guidance. The entertainment industry is back in full swing making movies and putting on sports. You fucking KNOW they're not practicing any of the shit they preach yet you continue to support them. FUCKING WHY!? THEY MADE THE FUCKING RULES AND EVEN THEY AREN'T FOLLOWING THEM! HOW FUCKING CUCKED ARE YOU!?!</p>
<p>The testing kits are faulty. The vaccines are dodgy as fuck and aren't nearly as good as they'd like you to believe they are otherwise we'd be back to normal now as more than enough people have had it; fucking tramp's piss being sold at a winery! Masks are exactly what you fucking say they are: a "piece of cloth". News flash, asshole: if you can smell your own fucking Dorito-flavored farts through your pants, trousers AND mask I don't think it's going to keep an airborne virus out! FUCK! I just fucking can't deal with this shit anymore. CLOWN WORLD. Fucking clown world!</p>
<p>We have destroyed our future for people who don't have one.</p></p>

        <p>I think you need a vacation or to go camping or something for a little bit without a phone. I’m not trying to be an ass either this shit does suck but nature is still beautiful for the time being. I’ve met some great people in states like arizona texas montana and west virginia who live like there was never a pandemic and still have a brain. TBTB want us all worked up over it when really it’s all a joke.</p>

        <p>I would typically agree, except tons of people who have no idea how to be outside in nature or previously didn’t care are now “discovering” the beauty of wilderness areas and consequently bringing their trash, poop, untrained unleashed dogs, and destructive behavior such as feeding wildlife or trying to pet them.</p>

        <p>You raise an excellent point, and those specifics you mentioned are far more egregious, but don't forget:  idiots walking or biking through nature while blasting their shitty music from a speaker instead of wearing headphones. Such oblivious stupidity.</p>

        <p>Bone conducting headphones or one ear out please! Nothing more frustrating than rolling up on a hiker who has zero idea you're behind them because they have headphones in. I have literally gotten off my bike and tapped someone on the shoulder and scared the shit out of them (unintentionally...but also not my fault!) after riding behind them for over 200 yards shouting that I'd like to pass. I'm about to start mowing people down. I don't want to run people over, if you're courteous and step aside for me, I'm happy to pass slowly and safely. My wheels and hubs make noise, I have a bell, and I call out "rider back, I'd like to pass when it's safe". If you make me scream at you and then look like a startled fucking rabbit when you finally notice me (usually followed by a WTF asshole look), then fuck you too and you're getting buzzed.</p>
<p>Edited to add: I agree speakers blasting music in nature is rude. I use Aeropex so I can listen to music AND still hear others around me.</p>

        <p>Slow clap.</p>
<p>Listen, the hypocrisy of the elites is our only hope out of this. When Nancy Pelosi was caught in a salon, what happened next? Salons were deemed okay. Same thing after the Calif governor was caught dining in a large group and the NYC mayor was found to be working out in a gym. Miraculously, these places began reopening.</p>
<p>They are just as oppressed by this shit as we are; they just have the added task of enforcing it on us. One by one, they will be found breaking their own rules. And, sorry, a tearful apology won't be enough. We demand the same privileges AND their resignation. It won't be long before they crack.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pelosi, Newsome and De Blasio are all still in office, but Newsome faces a recall. There have been some who resigned, I think in Canada it was a health minister who had the gall to post a Christmas message from St Barts. Pretty sure he got axed.</p>
<p>At the very least, it is embarrassing for them, AND stuff like that has been cited in legal actions that struck down tyrannical restrictions.</p>

        <p>You nailed it. </p>
<p>I'm getting real sick of this shit too. These people have destroyed MY mental health and they don't even give a fuck. I used to be fine. Now I spend my feelings (hello debt!), wake up with night terrors (my husband thinks I'm nuts when I get up and try to climb out the bedroom window in the middle of the night because I'm "locked in and trapped" - I'm not), and generally get jack shit done for work (luckily I can blame my lack of productivity mostly on COVID restrictions) which is NOT like me at all. </p>
<p>I pretty much Gym, ride my mountain bike, and sleep. Thats my life and these assholes have made me this way because I am NOT putting on a mask or falling for their bullshit scamdemic. </p>
<p>I think most of these terrified zombie sheep need to get a more exciting hobby if they're worried about a virus with a 99.8% or whatever it is survival rate. I could die any time on my mountain bike. Hit a rock wrong, endo, and break my neck any fucking ride. Maybe they need a little more excitement in their lives to put things in perspective. And some exercise wouldn't hurt most of them.</p>
