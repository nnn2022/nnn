        <p>Exactly how I’ve felt this whole time. We have never cared about other peoples’ health. I would never expect nor want everyone to care about mine. </p>
<p>Also your grandma dying is not a reason to shut down society</p>

        <p>I am so terrified of the future that I’m literally sick with anxiety. An eating disorder I used to have when I was a teenager, 15 years ago, that I thought I was long over is resurfacing and I have no idea who to talk to or what to do about it. I throw up if I eat too much and I can barely eat in the first place. It sucks. I’m losing weight way too fast and I can feel the disordered thinking about it taking control. I’m aware that it’s delusional and unhealthy but it’s not really in my control. I don’t like it and I want to change it. Please don’t roast me.</p>
<p>I want to try to be strong but it’s so hard. I feel so panicked and all I want to do is buy a gun and hide in the closet. I don’t want to hurt anyone of course, I just want to be able to defend myself and my cat and my partner.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, this just kind of hit home.</p>

        <p>This was like reading what's going on in my own head, just wanted to let you know that! I have said almost exactly what you just said over the past week or so. Last week I lost 9 lbs. I've been having issues breathing, nothing to do with a mask I think it's anxiety. I Can't Get Enough air into my lungs. I don't sleep and when I do sleep it's not a good sleep. Food doesn't taste good, I'm sure I'm probably depressed and anxious. It feels something like how I felt after my mom died. I lost 33 pounds in a month then the shock and Trauma was incredible. I feel very similar to that right now</p>
<p>I live in New York, we are the only state in the country doing the vaccine passport. I worry I'll lose my job. I've already lost friends. It has sent me over the edge in a way I never imagined. I feel like my life is completely ruined right now. I actually filed paperwork for a pistol permit the crime rates are so  out of control here. I feel like I need to learn how to defend myself because who knows what's coming.</p>
<p>I think maybe we need to get off the internet for a while, I have taken breaks and it does help. We need to think about history and how this has happened before, every 75 to 100 years people lose their mind and act like idiots. They seem to think giving away all their freedoms is a fantastic idea. I have concluded over the last few days that a lot of people don't like making decisions, they don't like the pressure of choosing what to do in life they prefer the government tells them these things and makes the decisions for them. They don't like Risk and they are obsessed with safety to a pathological unhealthy degree. Personal responsibility is no longer a thing, if your job to make sure other people are safe. It's the craziest thing ever. There's a lot going on right now, try to stay calm. Get some fresh air, have some healthy food, watch some completely unrelated videos or movies, try to hang in there! You are not alone!</p>

        <p>I feel the same and honestly I am a person who has sacrificed a lot for others in my life. I've always extended myself to other people and gone above and beyond through my career as well as in my personal life. But I'm finding that these situations we are in are having the opposite effect on me. Like constantly talking about about keeping other people safe and sacrificing my mental health as well as my future and ruining my life for this is making me hate other people and not give a shit whether they drop dead in the street or not. I'm resentful and angry. I think it's because never in a million years would I ever ask anyone else to do this. I would never expect other people to consider me and put my safety first. The thought would never even pop into my head and I can't believe that there are millions of people who think like this now. </p>
<p>It's the same with the whole racism thing. Never in my life have I been as conscious of race and thought about it as much as over the past year. And I have actually always been a minority in my career and where I live. I am a white person but I have always ended up in situations where I live in or work around communities that are not white. I never thought about it. Now it's constantly on my mind when I'm outside. Maybe not as much now but last summer during the riots and everything it was all I thought about. And guess what? It made me completely resentful of people running around calling white people racist. Like who the fuck are you running around calling people you don't know racist, and saying horrible negative things about them. And then telling me that you can't be racist? This entire way of shaming people now has made me hate everyone. It's so damaging I have to tell myself on a daily basis don't succumb to this, this is what they want you to do. They want you to hate others and that's not who you are don't do it. But man oh man is it tempting. My patience is worn thin.</p>

        <p>Their grandma almost died because she's old. At that age, a simple fall could mean curtains for them. And by saying "almost" means she survived so give her immune system a little credit.</p>
