    <strong>People are angry and on edge, more so than ever now. And as someone who works in retail, I'm exhausted.</strong>
    <p><p>I'll be checking people out and they'll mumble something under their mask, and when I ask them to repeat themselves, they'll snap at me and act like I'm an idiot. I'll take calls where people ask what we're doing to sanitize and clean, and then become angry at the answer because it "isn't enough" and we "don't care about our customers".</p>
<p>Mind you, I'm considered essential, so I've been at work this entire time. I've seen the gradual decline in general politeness and courtesy. I won't lie- it's depressing as fuck. I'm so tired of going into work, only to be abused and mistreated because of the frustration that all this is causing. We had to kick a guy out of the store the other day because he was harassing another customer for not wearing a mask, and he called me a wh<em>re and a b</em>tch as he left. </p>
<p>I'm thankful to have a job. I really am. But I'm growing to hate people's behavior more and more by the day. <em>None</em> of this is healthy for anyone, socially, mentally, or physically.</p></p>

        <p>It's depressing af.  I was hitting up walmart to buy some beers and they didn't have enough cashiers and people couldn't even hide the emotions people in public usually do.  It wasn't anger as might be expected.  Just see pure exhaustion and sadness in peoples' faces, like having to wait 45 minutes in line was just another aspect of this grim reality to accept.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My gym is even sadder.  10 person capacity cap in a giant gym where there has never been an outbreak or case.  Mask mandate.  When snow is on the ground and it's dark out at 4:30 I really fear for what peoples' mental states will become.</p>

        <p>I get this. I have been feeling so down lately. Long lines in Walmart last week. Started getting annoyed. Then I turned it around a bit as a few people were looking at me. So I started making a few jokes. Made some people laugh. It felt good. But overall I am worn down and bone weary about all this. I am such a placid person. See the good. But my patience is wearing very thin and tbh I hate myself sometimes. I know I have to get a grip but it’s getting harder. It was hard enough in March. It’s nearly December now.</p>

        <p>Same. It's getting cold and dark here in the Midwest and I've found myself the last few nights desperate to stay outside until the last of the light disappears because I can't take going inside, sitting around doing nothing, for one more day... But there's nothing to <em>do</em> as everything is stupid, masked, and afraid.</p>

        <p>In my area too. Masks are mandatory here now and gatherings can only be X amount of people. There are people online BEGGING for people who break the rules to be jailed, doxxed, and have their healthcare taken away. We are honestly only a few steps away from full blown fascism.</p>

        <p>Thank you. I wish more people had your attitude. Genuinely, I do.</p>
<p>The media has made it so <em>easy</em> to dehumanize people at this point. I mean, you all have seen how people talk about "anti-maskers". Don't get me wrong- I wear a mask out of politeness (and because it's mandated at my job). But everyone should get a choice, and government mandates are disgusting.</p>
<p>What's being spread around now isn't COVID, but a self-perpetuating sense of self righteousness and disdain toward everyone else. "I wear a mask, so I'm more important than you. I get to work from home, so I know better than you. I'm a good person, so I get to tell you what to do."</p>
<p>Good people don't abuse others just to feel morally superior.</p>

        <p>I've hardly worn a mask at all.  But I don't like to see people (rightfully) annoyed about wearing the mask taking it out on the retail staff who are forced to enforce it.  <em>They</em> have to wear it all day long, and I'm sure a majority would rather not, nor be in a position where they're forced to push it on customers. It's the inverse of good customer service.</p>
<p>My attitude is cheerful and friendly.  "No thanks, I'm healthy and not worried about catching it!  But I appreciate your concern!"</p>

        <p>If a customer has a medical exemption theydont need a mask. Many businesses will not tolerate that excuse and still make people wear them or leave. This is when you hear stories of people going off on staff and in these cases it is the staff's fault for not accepting a perfectly legitimate excuse to not wear the mask. Every single state mandate clearly says if you have a medical exemption you don't need to wear one. If you work somewhere and someone says they can't medically tolerate a mask and you insist then you deserve to be chewed out</p>

        <p>That's what I saw when I went on a motorcycle road trip to Kentucky back in July.  I hate fast food, normally I eat at local restaurants, but fast food joints were the only ones open.  Most of the residentsI saw walking around weren't bothering with masks, but the moment I stepped one foot inside the door of a restaurant or store the employees were calling out that I had to put a mask on or leave.  Most were apologetic or even seemed a little ashamed to have to do that, but I was told several times that the local department of health would shut them down right away if they didn't enforce the state's rules.</p>

<p>Bingo. Internet is real life now. </p>
<p>God knows I feel that way. Masked people are just anonymous NPCs who are in my way while I'm trying to shop, drive, or do whatever. Advertising their covidian status plus erasing their faces equals no visceral gut level reason to see them as people anymore, and that's just as  good because they treat the sight of my face like a broken pipe spewing mustard gas.</p>

        <p>There was a lady a few months ago who was incredibly rude to the grocery store cashier next to me. My boyfriend could feel me tensing up. She was yelling at the lady that said that she (the cashier) was bagging her groceries wrong because she “wouldn’t be able to keep her DoorDash deliveries separate correctly!”</p>
<p>I politely mentioned to her, “Hey, when my bf and I want to keep purchases separate, we just have a few separate transactions. The cashiers are really nice about.”</p>
<p>She told me to ‘shut up, nobody asked you, this is none of your business’ and I went OFF on the women. Rightly called her a lazy bully, which she was. I said the cashiers here can’t yell at you since they’re on the clock, so I’m doing it on their behalf. Made her MORE angry. Manager gets called, woman gets BANNED from the supermarket squawking this was ridiculous and she didn’t deserve this, and I should be kicked out not her, blah blah blah.</p>
<p>I got a round of applause from the other cashiers once she left the building.</p>
<p>No way would she have had the guts to do that without wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Suck it Karen. I’m ready to throw down. My 5’ 4” frame ain’t afraid of you</p>

        <p>I'm not advocating getting up in the grill of retail workers -- retail sucks. I had customer service jobs before and during college, so I have plenty of my own stories of dealing with entitled lunatics.</p>
<p>But I will say this: my wife has asked why it seems like I go "immediately from 2 to 10" when it comes to dealing with overzealous mask enforcers. And what I told her was: I might be <em>projecting</em> a 2, but inside, because of what the world has become and a near-total lack of anything that actually brought me joy in it, I'm a 7 or 8 <em>all the damn time.</em></p>
<p>I wholeheartedly concur: it's <em>not</em> healthy, and people are going to snap. I recognize I am more privileged than many, and <em>still</em> every day gets harder. Especially when I see people in a mask <em>alone... outdoors... in the suburbs... 200+ feet away from any other human that I can see.</em></p>
<p>Yes, technically there is an in-public mask order here, but requiring them outdoors is so mind-numbingly stupid and unscientific, I weep for the collective stupidity of the herd that goes along with something <em>that</em> awful and insane.</p>
<p>Honestly, I have no idea how retail staff hasn't just gone on a mass strike <em>somewhere</em> (yes, some places they probably can't afford it), because they have it even worse (although now my wife's office is now pushing masks at all times, even <em>alone in your office with the door closed</em>).</p>

        <p>I wear a mask the entire time at work, excepting my lunch break. That's about 8 1/2 to 9 hours. I think the worst thing is the anxiety, and the mask making it difficult to breathe when I'm anxious. It sucks, for sure.</p>
<p>I think it's really a ticking time bomb, to be honest. I know I'm getting more and more depressed by the day. This isn't sustainable the way it's going. Anyone who says that this has brought out the best in people is a damn liar. This has by far brought out the absolute worst in everyone.</p>

        <p>To a large extent, it already has escalated to violence. </p>
<p>We went months on end with BLM and Antifa street thugs burning and looting cities with impunity. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in the world, totalitarian police states have formed in formerly free democracies, with police officers exercising violence against protesters and free-facers.</p>

        <p>Exactly, it's the interior, suppressed anger. Not just the absurdity of the measures, but also being harshly criticized any time you question them.  Or family members thinking you suddenly became a "Trump supporter" when they see you maskless.  We bury it to be polite members of society, but it becomes an internal slow-boiling anger that won't go away, and erupts on some fresh new absurdity.  </p>

        <p>Tell them what I tell them. I'm not a Trump supporter, I'm anti-restrictionist and pro-liberty, which makes me virulently anti-Democrat, by default.</p>
<p>To be fair, I'm anti quite a few Republicans as well, but the Democrats and blue-state RINOs have been the most awful about pandemic nonsense by a <em>wide</em> margin.</p>
<p>From reading comments here, it seems there's still a lot of localized nonsense in "open" Florida. And I'll wager that a bunch of South Dakota <em>businesses</em> probably have the stupid face diaper signs up, at least the corporate chains.</p>

        <p>My adult children simply get a sullen look on their face when I say that, but they don't push back.  By Jove, we thought we raised them to be independent thinkers and challenge the status quo.   But the Narrative has them in its grip, and to them, I'm being totally reckless and uncaring.  Gaslighting doesn't begin to cover it.  But I have confidence that I've done my due diligence in trying to understand what's going on, and I can't be gaslighted out of it.  I could always be wrong... but I was 100% right on Afghanistan/Iraq back in the day, and I have a similar level of confidence now.</p>

        <p>Seriously, I thought for sure that if they’re one of the few places open for being “essential” why don’t they just go on strike so they can finally get that “living wage” they want so bad?  </p>
<p>Surely if everywhere else is closed and the one open place is on strike that would get the ball rolling in their favour?</p>
<p>Imagine being told that everywhere is closed for a “super deadly pandemic” but oh lucky you, you still have to work in person throughout it!  Oh and a wage increase or hazard pay for the risk of exposing yourself to this deadly illness?

        <p>That’s a start man. But you could think of other ways to fight back. Leave notes. Make conversation. </p>
<p>Why can’t you afford to lose that job? I recently cut subscriptions and a few other luxuries so that if work got slow (I have a different problem) I wouldn’t be under water. </p>
<p>I think this is a great time to reflect on how to be independent to the point where you can tell anyone asking you to wear that stupid shit to fuck off. </p>

        <p>You should definitely go for it! The first time I went maskless in Walmart I felt so free, it's now been three months since then and I hardly ever wear one. Even though I'm usually the only one, I just smile at people, and have never had anyone (aside from employees) say anything to me. I think that's what does it too, people are just happy to see a smile again. But I don't give employees a hard time because my bf is forced to enforce it at his job and I see both sides. He also complains about being treated worse than usual (he's a server) since the mask mandates. I'm just grateful my longtime workplace doesn't enforce anything, so I don't have to wear one there. I feel for you having to deal with the rudeness and dehumanization. Hopefully as time goes on more businesses will stand against the masks and maybe you'll have more options of places to work.</p>

        <p>Feeling morally superior because wearing a mask “saves lives” has emboldened these lunatics. They feel that they have the right to abuse and shame you for not wearing a mask. And at the same time abuse the workers because they don’t feel safe in that environment. </p>
<p>They will continue to be aggressive because they feel that they’re on the right side of history therefore their actions are justified. </p>

        <p>It’s something I’ve been saying for months; wearing masks dehumanizes people. As someone else mentioned, it’s the same reason people are nastier on the internet than they (usually) are in real life: anonymity.</p>
<p>A year ago I’d have thought my current self crazy, but I honestly believe that the “elites” behind this WANT discord and depression, because at least some of them want to partially depopulate the world. With discord, there’s a higher likelihood of homicide; with depression, there’s a higher likelihood of... self-termination.</p>
<p>For those of us with no authority and no way to change the “rules,” I don’t know what the solution is. All I know is, for me, I’ll both comply and defy as my conscience allows (even if that seems a bit schizo), and I will continue to act civilized to people, because no one that I know has the authority to change the rules (even high-ranking people have superiors who will allow no deviation to their orders).</p>

        <p>&rt;I'll take calls where people ask what we're doing to sanitize and clean</p>
<p>Honestly, I couldn't do what you do, because I would ragequit over that one thing on day one. Not only do these assholes want to tear down society out of fear, they want to make everyone else's working life EXTRA FUCKING DIFFICULT so they can feel safer <strong>going out in public to do things, which according to their dogma they should only do when absolutely necessary</strong>. "You really shouldn't be open at all, but if you are, I'm going to need you to engage in some endless deep-cleaning ritual which really has no effect but lets my conscience rest after taking advantage of your services."</p>
<p>The only major benefit I foresee as a result of 2020, is people just saying "fuck work, fuck jobs" forevermore, and choosing to drop out of the system in record numbers. If we're going to be forced to shut down, then fuck it, let's go all the goddamned way. None of this half-assery which allows billionaires to keep consolidating their wealth while the rest of us try to psychologically fend off the ever-ratcheting psychotic-Karenism of our fellow man.</p>
<p>My wife used to be a barista, loved it. Sure, it was hard and she had the occasional bratty-ass customer, but overall it was a tolerable way to earn a living. Post-COVID, she said it was just awful, nothing like the previous job. When they weren't having to ritually clean things down after every. fucking. transaction, they were dealing with angry people, struggling to understand muffled orders behind masks, not able to have fun and joke around with their coworkers (greatly reduced staffing + distancing), no more hugs or anything, blah blah. Just a pathetic, sad shadow of what the job and workplace used to be - all to keep the terrified customers appeased. If they are so scared about magic flying viruses, why are they going to public places and having exhausted strangers (who probably slip up all the time) making them drinks??</p>

        <p>Sounds like they are just regular people in a bad mood. Increasingly, you'll also have to watch out for people like me, who are purposely going hard on any employee who asks us to wear a mask. The reason is that being polite and nice doesn't work. The only way businesses will start to push back against this, is when they can no longer stay staffed and/or are going broke - in other words, when they are forced to. Think about how activists always get their way with various companies. It's like that. You are caught in the middle until you quit, which you should. Why bust your ass everyday to take this abuse, while so many people are getting paid to sit at home at your expense?</p>

<p>That being said- do consider that the employees asking you to mask up are just doing their job. I don't blame you for refusing, but it's corporate policy that's making them say that, not personal preference.</p>

        <p>is your IQ lower than 50 or what? It's because there's no general strike happening. It takes everyone rising up.. 99% of the country is asleep.. so you do one of two things.. you keep cow towing, or you figure it the fuck out.</p>

        <p>I actually have misanthropic views myself these days. As for being told to shove it because "everyone is suffering right now," it brings to mind something I saw somewhere online: just because person A is suffering more than Person B, it doesn't mean Person B's suffering is invalid.</p>
