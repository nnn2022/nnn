    <strong>Shuffling depressed people in a store</strong>
    <p><p>I am high risk, so was more isolated then your average person. I did decide to "live" more of life. I live in a locked down place. Even if you want to go and do things, there's nowhere to go. Some restaurants are open but that's about it. [25-50 percent capacity?] Most are doing take out. </p>
<p>I hadn't been in this one large store in almost 18 months, I went during a slow time, watching everyone shuffle around in masks, was a weird feeling. It was so quiet, that was strange. No one was talking. There were other couples there too but they were silent. I can't hear in the masks so our conversation was muted too but not by choice though we communicated enough at times to pick a vacuum cleaner. I had my transcribe phone and hearing aids with me [that I have to take out to wear the masks] but we talked on the way there and in car.  Even if you go out around here, while nature and parks can be enjoyable, nothing is the same. Probably a lot of people have local families or close friends they can hang out with but I bet some don't. We had a lot of casual ties but not close enough. I have been to some medical places and centers out of necessity, but it was weird to me how the stores had just silent people moving along too. The handmaid's grocery store on Handmaid's Tale full of armed guards had more conversation and connection among people. </p>
<p>We debated where to go on our anniversary. I said "Everything's closed". I thought of going some place to take pictures but even the nature center has it's facilities closed which I need to even go there [bathroom etc] </p>
<p>I go out to get sunshine and air, and some needed things but social interaction and civic groups etc, are dead here. I haven't seen a person smile or laugh [except on Zoom and husband] in 18 months.  Outside is so depressing, there's times I just stay home. Also sometimes while I fear Covid less knowing they exaggerated the PCR numbers etc, being this high risk, my mind needs the break of the worry. How many years is this crap going to last? The population is being beaten down. I would start seeing people myself [well the ones who aren't banning the unvaccinated which is the majority here now] but do think there could be a spike protein shedding, so am holding off for now. The stories about the unvaccinated getting sick are piling up.</p>
<p>They took all the fun and laughter away and that creeps me out. Illness with out end. Their phoney vaccines that don't bring immunity and end transmission also disgust me.</p></p>

        <p>True.</p>
<p>I never liked this area because the people here are too self contained, one side of the state is almost completely different from the other side of the state I lived on.</p>

        <p>I feel ya. I’m Michigan born and bred and live in a medium sized city there. I’ve watched Whitmer bankrupt at least a third of the small businesses in my town, including several restaurants that have been here for fifty years, while Walmart, Lowe’s, and the pot dispensaries are packed. I watched small businesses struggle to last long enough to almost re-open before BLM and Antifa rolled through to loot and vandalize our downtown area with impunity. Almost all were from somewhere else. That was the last straw for a lot of business in our downtown, and they’re now just vacant properties. 
Having lived here my whole life, I know a lot of people. There are basically two main groups now; those who just want to live a semi-normal life and go out and enjoy the spring, see friends and family, and earn a living, and those who seem to relish the fear diet they’ve been on for a year. Unfortunately, the majority of people here will openly be hostile if they see you without a mask, and seek to out you if they know you didn’t stampede to get your shots. They won’t just avoid you, they will actively slander and try to damage you or your business. I’ve experienced it. It’s hard not to have anxiety going out here, not because of the virus, but because of the random, unexpected, and extreme actions of maskers who have been brainwashed with fear by the media.  One good thing I’ve noticed recently though is that more and more people are resisting the mob and trying to return to normal, including businesses that are clearly not taking the mask BS seriously.  There’s a lot of frustration and F-you brewing, and more people are standing up for themselves. 
And for all the hype about Michigan drowning in Covid....a relative who works for our local hospital keeps informing me that there are very few Covid patients there and there haven’t been for a long time, so take that as you will.</p>

        <p>Yeah our businesses have been closing, restaurants I used to go to for years are GONE. Boarded up store fronts.  Sorry to hear that happened to your town too. :( I focused on "saving" two restaurants, giving them the majority of my business, I guess I figured focusing on one or two favorites may help them stay open. However so much has closed here, I am having to buy most things online. Even shopping outside of thrift stores and corporates is DEAD as a doornal here. </p>
<p>I am glad you know a lot of people. We are paying dearly for our lack of close friends here, it is depressing, there's no one to go see and as a couple we are isolated to the max. I know if I was not married I would have already cracked up. My isolation has worsened seeing all friends and casual folks in groups line up. I have been invalidated even the few times I said something to a few people. His best friend got the vaccination who lives about an hour and half away and I am too afraid of the spike proteins for now, it upsets me as I tried to talk that guy out of it.</p>
<p>The majority here all lined up. I can't even share the opinions anywhere I share on this board. I have had people in one group who kept asking me if I got the shot, tons of pressure. I am still in the group on Zoom but I feel "afraid" of them and not as comfortable. I told the leader of the group I wasn't getting the shot for health reasons but could tell they were upset. [I have extreme health problems that show so the ableism with this seemed beyond the pale] </p>
<p>Others I changed the subject or simply didn't answer. I am getting a little bit of a shunning feeling. Some don't seem to understand the vaccines don't protect like old ones  either. Yeah that's horrible you got slandered and business put under pressure. I am glad that you have some resisters there. I wear the masks due to being higher risk but leave the unmasked alone now. I think they are LYING their asses off about Covid spreading here. I don't even know one person with it. [and I am in zooms and groups where I would know out of 50 or so people someone who would have it. </p>
<p>One thing scares me, I know the extreme isolation is affecting my mental health and don't see that changing. Having everything fun taken away was not easy either. I don't know how to fix this.  With my disabilities, on autistic spectrum and deafness [i use transcribe phone and hearing aids] I was already more isolated then normal people outside of my marriage. I don't want to live a life like this with no other people in it. From what I can tell the epidemic is over,  considering whatever real SARS was out there outside the labeled as such colds and flus, and they are dragging it out to hell and back for the depopulation vaccines.</p>

        <p>Trying to find what states in the Midwest have lockdowns still in place. Here in wisconsin, things are mostly back to normal (at least outside Madison and Milwaukee). Minnisota still has a mask mandate, but no lockdowns. Are you one of the poor souls living under the deranged rule of Gov Whitmer?</p>

        <p>Red isnt much better than blue. I really wish the Libertarian party could unify, but its kind of against our individualist natures. </p>
<p>Take a vacation; take a ship across lake Michigan up to Sheboygan or Green Bay. Have some brats. Meet some locals. Its nice here.</p>
