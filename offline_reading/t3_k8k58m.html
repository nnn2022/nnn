    <strong>I've noticed a lot more "All hope is lost" posts on here. Those people are even worse than the doomers who want more lockdowns.</strong>
    <p><p>The people who are giving up at this point are accepting the new normal. They don't see the cracks forming in the pavement and the possibility that we will soon reach a critical mass in pockets across the world that will start an avalanche of dissent. DO NOT LOSE HOPE. That is exactly what the government NEEDS you to do so that they win.</p></p>

        <p>Though only submissive people are boring for sadists there is also a lot of sick pleasure of people desperately trying to fight back - and loosing. Because the sadist then knows they suffer way more than the submissive people, so they probably even prefer that.</p>

        <p>&rt;this isn't a time for defeatism</p>
<p>The whole concept of "defeatism" is naive nonsense - many terrible situations don't have any solution at all, and I'm pretty sure a global fascist high-tech-enslavement-system has none from the perspective of someone at the very bottom of it. </p>
<p>Is that "defeatist"? - No it's simply being realistic and obviously so.</p>

        <p>I think we are slowly growing more and more mass, like a snowball. We're picking up some now through the holidays, as some rebel to meet for those. I think there will be more when we hit the one-year mark (which in my area, will be mid-March). More when it warms up, it has been OVER a year, when we're out of the general cold/flu season and the doomers are getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>If restrictions are still going on as we head into next holiday season, our snowball will get even bigger, from the people who were willing to give up one set of holidays to the dictators, but not another. I'm sorry that it's so painfully slow, but I have hope that we'll win in the end, I hope this helps a little.</p>

<p>You don't have to be sorry, we are all deeply affected by this.</p>
<p>I really hope you are right, and there certainly are more people awake than ever before in the last few decades, though I'm not sure if this is enough because being awake in itself doesn't stop violent oppression.</p>

        <p>Dude, take a hike with the bullshit. I'm not attacking you, if you feel attacked, that's on you. Fact remains you're on a sub where people are trying to talk about ways to combat the new normal. You wanna make it seem like nothing can be done, cool, you're wrong, and your message is a disservice to the sub. </p>
<p>Someone who pushes a message of defeatism shouldn't be using the word bravery. It doesn't line up. </p>
<p>What should people do? Is that what you want to know? Ultimately, they should band together, work with their local police to flip them, remain peaceful at all times, and go outside and tell them simply that they will not comply. If you don't know who Gene Sharp is, look him up, read his stuff, and you'll have a way better answer than I can ever give you. </p>
<p>&rt;Could easily happen, but don't think that this weren't according to their plan, they aren't dumb.</p>
<p>Nah, the populace is dumb, they know exactly what the majority of people will do, which is roll over, like you. I'd rather make it difficult for them, even if means saying goodbye. The absolute last thing anyone in power wants is a populace to take action. When you say they aren't dumb, you're correct, but they are planned for ARMED insurrection only, they have zero answers for a peaceful populace led by older folks and including children in the streets simply saying "No More".</p>

<p>the police isn't "theirs", but the fascist enforcers beating up peaceful people in stormtrooper gear while getting filmed by peaceful people standing close by</p>

<p>&rt; to flip them, remain peaceful at all times</p>
<p>fat chance of winning against violent oppression this way. Do you think the jews could have freed themselves this way too?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The absolute last thing anyone in power wants is a populace to take action.</p>
<p>Depends of what the action is, if it's premeditated by them, then that's exactly what they want - just like the riots a few months ago.</p>

<p>&rt;When you say they aren't dumb, you're correct, but they are planned for  ARMED insurrection only, they have zero answers for a peaceful populace  led by older folks and including children in the streets simply saying  "No More".</p>
<p>Yeah that's a scenario very hard to anticipate, and impossible to counter for them. Wait no, it's pretty much the most obvious thing you can come up with.</p>

        <p>"Things are never getting better" is a good starting point at least. We need to realize its NOT getting better on its own.</p>
<p>"It will get better eventually" is a dangerous mindset. Lots of people are still saying, "I'll comply now, because it will be better soon."</p>
<p>We need to find a good balance. We need to realize restrictions aren't going away and things are going to get much worse. That just means we need to fight harder, not give up completely.</p>

        <p>I think I'm in the "I'm waiting for someone to do something about it" mindset currently.</p>
<p>I'm not leadership material, nor would I have a plan or vision to see how to make people rise up and fight the injustice. But I'm waiting for someone, or some group, or something at all to step up and get the ball rolling. If there's a movement, I want to be apart of it.</p>
<p>Until then, I feel helpless to really do anything other than try to get by and rant about it online. <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/022/747/download.jpg">This is about how I feel right now.</a></p>

        <p>If you’re loosing hope, my advice is to have a few days off. I know it’s hard to avoid most things lockdown/covid but sometimes taking a step back and re-approaching the situation with a fresh mindset can do absolute wonders. We have to be strong because we are literally the only ones fighting this battle. Ultimately light is more powerful than the darkness.</p>

        <p>That’s not what I’m saying. I’m saying stop focusing on all the hype for a few days. After a while it can become unhealthy to do the same thing over and over again, and if people are feeling beaten down to the point where they almost consider wearing masks just to make it easier, then perhaps a few days focusing on what’s good about life away from all the arguing and gaslighting may bring about a fresh perspective. </p>

        <p>Sometimes people need to break down first before they can reach their full potential.</p>
<p>Just because they're losing hope now, that doesn't mean they won't be standing on the barricades once their duty calls.</p>
<p>We're all human here. We're all fragile. We all have our breaking points.</p>
<p>We're not China vases, though. We can become better after we break down. We can come out stronger. And we should!</p>

        <p>It's called depression.</p>
<p>I understand your point, but it's asking too much for some people to continue holding on to what seems like false hope. It's no different than repeatedly telling someone "it gets better" for the thousandth time when it really hasn't gotten better.</p>
<p>No one gives up hope because they want to. Repeatedly being let down <em>hurts</em>, and there is only so much a person can take. I'm of the opinion blind optimism helps no one. This is something I once went through years before 2020.</p>
<p>Even the words in your post are nothing more than speculation. Now, how many times did people hear "this will all be over after [particular date or month]", only for that to not be true? Hell, I said back in March this would not end in two weeks, and by May, I believed it would go into 2021. I was called a conspiracy theorist, among other names, and yet, look where lockdown is headed. Right into 2021.</p>
<p>You can't ask people to keep crashing. You just can't.</p>

        <p>I don't believe there will be a reversal although I certainly hope so.<br>
When forced to lockdowns you reduce your daily activity outside your home, thus also your daily potential for such activity before you're exhausted.<br>
Remember when you skipped to the next tier in school as a child and hours became much longer but soon you grew into it. This is doing the reverse.</p>

        <p>Well. Here is a sports analogy.  It's the 4th quarter . "They" have the ball. There is 3 seconds left and we are down by 9 million points. Saying "I think we lost" isnt being a Doomer. Its accepting reality. The time to "something" was 20-30 years ago. But people who pointed out this EXACT SITUATION happening 20-30 years ago were called "crazy" and "conspiracy theorists ".  The bed has been made, now lie in it.</p>
