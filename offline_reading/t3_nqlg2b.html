    <strong>They aren’t yet mandating vaccines because they need a scapegoat for when it inevitably fails.</strong>
    <p><p>Calling it here again. The powers that be need something to blame when something goes wrong so they need a subgroup of population to point fingers at. It’s a tried and true methodology in history after all. </p>
<p>China bot hive minds please weigh in too, we are open here for discussion unlike the other antifa subs.</p></p>

        <p>Here is a question for everyone who questions the magical science juice...why do you limit the scrutiny to just the most recent shots? What if...the same liars had brought you all of the previous science juice shots in similar fashion? What if the safety testing was flawed for all of the shots, but this was just the first time you took notice?</p>

        <p>I haven't been vaccinated since I was a kid. Never had any serious illness. There is anecdotal evidence that vaccines given to children can cause autism and other problems. </p>
<p>Not saying they are all bad, but when you hear stories of kids becoming permanently disabled after getting vaccinated, it makes you very suspicious.</p>

        <p>What if no one can find Gallo's supposed study that proved that HIV causes AIDS? They can't. What if HIV meds are given to healthy people simply because they "test positive" for HIV and what if those meds that are supposed to prevent illness are actually incredibly toxic and when you inevitably get sick from the meds themselves you are told t that it's not the meds, it's the HIV progressing, which the meds were supposed to prevent? Yeah, the rabbit hole goes deep.</p>

        <p>I think that’s the agenda, but I don’t think it’s going to happen. Too many now know people that have had severe adverse reactions to the vaccine or died. I have two neighbors right on my street that have- <em>that I know of</em>- who knows how many more. Just like the fraud that happened with DT’s first election, they were so overconfident they fkd up, and this time they put too many real vaccines and not enough placebos in circulation. All we’re watching is a dead-cat bounce- they’re done. Doesn’t mean they are giving up, but the forces of good are winning, though there will still be many casualties as in all wars, sadly.</p>

        <p>I think it takes time to mandate the vaccines and they can get other entities to do their dirty work for them so they haven't needed to yet. Once it's approved for children 5 and up, I won't be surprised to see it mandated for schools. Many employers are pressuring or mandating the vaccine as well. They're still doing the slow boil after all. Slowly apply pressure, claim it's not mandated, it's just required to participate in x, y and z while x,y and z are all normal things that most everyone needs to be able to do.</p>

        <p>No one I know has woken up. The rare problems of c19 were overstated, and the rare problems of the shots were dismissed. A plateful of nothingburgers, as far as they're concerned. Whatever story is on the news will still be believed.</p>

        <p>Yeah in Sept 2019 California passed a law giving the state final say in any medical exemption for vaccines. If a doctor exceeds a certain threshold of exemptions, the state can review all his exemptions and decide for themselves whether to uphold them. Here's the best part... if they decide to "review" your exemption, it is revoked until further notice which means your child is immediately subject to the vaccine requirement to attend school. Again, this took effect 1/1/2020. Almost like it was planned or something...</p>
