<title>Isn’t it interesting that big subreddits can’t stop talking about Florida and Florida cases and fear? Yet, Florida is middle of the pack in deaths per million. Top states by deaths? New Jersey, perverted Governor’s, Massachusetts.</title>

    <strong>Isn’t it interesting that big subreddits can’t stop talking about Florida and Florida cases and fear? Yet, Florida is middle of the pack in deaths per million. Top states by deaths? New Jersey, perverted Governor’s, Massachusetts.</strong>
    <p><p>E.g.</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/p1n0he/floridas_death_toll_now_exceeds_desantis_margin/</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/oyrdmm/ron_desantis_approval_rating_tanks_as_covid_delta/</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/p1oqe7/bill_burr_tears_into_florida_gov_ron_desantis/</p>
<p>Absolute insanity. Nothing at all about deaths in Massachusetts or New Jersey or New York. Everything is Florida Florida Florida. Why?</p>
<p>The media does this so that people reading it will lose faith and trust in their ruling government there. They want to demoralize citizens and make them vote against Desantis and republicans next election. This is ONLY about politics and nothing else. Where did all the Cuomo sexuals go? Wasn’t he such a hero in how he handled covid? He was in the spotlight non stop.</p>
<p>Why is no one saying anything about New Jersey almost having double the deaths per million compared to Florida? Clearly, other states should be following Florida because they’re doing something right. </p>
<p>Furthermore, you’d expect Florida to have more deaths given that it’s a place where most retirees go to live and thus an older population. Florida’s median age is the 6th oldest in the US.</p>
<p>Propaganda propaganda propaganda.</p>

        <p>I’d much more prefer the media just say:</p>
<p>We don’t like that Florida has a conservative government. We want to flip it. We’re not going to make up lies and use misleading statistics, but the current candidates running for government would be better because…</p>
<p>The way they do it now just leaves everyone confused and stupider.</p>
<p>Their roundabout way is anything happening is because of the republican government. The same playbook under trump. Anything bad happening in the US was because of him, anything good was overlooked, the same things that are still going on under Biden are now ignored.</p>

        <p>I'm in Florida. We're good (meaning the unvaxxed).</p>
<p>The vaxxed though...it's happening.</p>
<p>Lost 5 customers this year to the shot and another one today entered Death Watch, formerly known as ICU.</p>
<p>Lost nobody to Covid last year. I know, it's anecdotal but the amount of death coming to Florida this winter is going to be epic. All these Boomers ran down as fast as they could to get Satan's piss. Less Boomers is definitely a benefit, so maybe it's not all bad. </p>
<p>All I know is DeSantis is about to have a MAJOR public health crisis on his hands because he did nothing to thwart his citizens from getting the killshot. It will ultimately be his political undoing no matter how well positioned he seems to be currently.</p>
