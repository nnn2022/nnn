    <strong>Why does China have inactivated virus vaccine but we only have mRNA vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>It's so fishy why China can have inactivated virus vaccine which is basically what every vaccine ever has been, but here in the west we are forced to take experimental mRNA vaccine only when really we should be at least given a choice.</p>
<p>The technology clearly exists, China has it, but we don't? Why? This is really sus that they are forcing experimental technology on us.</p></p>

        <p>The agenda is simple. Weaken the population of the rest of the world so that China can takeover easily . </p>
<p>Did you also know that China is now trying to make their men more masculine through mandatory government programs now?</p>
<p>They are softening us up while building themselves up. Now what do you guys think is going to come after that? ....You do the math.</p>

        <p>Agreed, sounds like comparison between pan troglodytes proactive political games over status (Goodness Paradox), fertile females and offspring compared pan paniscus society based on playful prosociality for promotion of group stability regardless of age and gender as a byproduct of specific socioecological environment.</p>

<p>Yea..  and they also think they're going to win because "their culture is superior to ours."</p>
<p>These half-assed CCP ideas are just that.  They can only work if other world leaders are basically incompetent and ignore the problem,  or get paid off to ignore the problem.  Once someone wakes up and literally lifts a finger to do something about it,  the whole CCP house of cards comes crumbling down.</p>
<p>Also,  don't forget,  India's army (active+reserve) is about as large as China's army,  and China is <em>not</em> surrounded by incredibly friendly countries.</p>

It's a race to be the first with the biggest population submitted to their network, that will evolve to be the global ruling party. It's a race between Western countries lead by the US, and China, which started to form a bloc with Russia. Both sides are rushing to get their <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/internet-of-bodies-covid19-recovery-governance-health-data/">internet of bodies</a> lauched, for which they need your biometrics and get you injected/implanted with technology.

        <p>Real answers? a) Inactivated virus vaccines are much more difficult to produce at scale, and b) no U.S. pharma company is going to take on the development of a new vaccine unless they know they'll get a patent out of it. </p>
<p>China is nothing if not good at producing at scale, and intellectual property rights are basically not a thing, so they're focusing on making inactivated virus vaccines, since they are tried-and-true if not especially effective.</p>

        <p>When I first heard about this I was shocked. I was assuming there was a solid reason we needed to have MRNA. That it couldn't be done any other way.  As far as I'm concerned, emergency use shouldn't have been granted before trying the old fashioned vaccine first.  There has to be a reason they wanted MRNA. We could hope it's about patents and money but I think we need be be open that there's more to it than that.</p>

        <p>China is quick to leverage anything as an opportunity to strengthen it's global influence. They don't care if their vaccine is 20-50% effective, the "China gave us the vaccine" is too useful diplomatically.</p>
<p>In the west, anything less than 90% effective is considered a failure. The non-mRNA path meant 5+ years of development time minimum to develop a more conventional vaccine.</p>

        <p>Your second paragraph has several inaccuracies.  The FDA stated last year that 50% would be acceptable for approval [1].  The FDA approved the J&amp;J vaccine with it’s average 66% efficacy [2].  While it is true that mRNA technology does offer a potentially faster path (hence why richer nations bet on it), other conventional vaccines have developed including J&amp;J, Oxford/AstraZeneca, Sputnik V.  There are a number of others nearing completion like Novavax [3].</p>

        <p>It doesn’t work as well. The Chinese pharmaceuticals can submit their vaccine to the FDA for review but studies outside of China (and not dependent on Chinese government) show it is about 51% effective. The FDA would likely reject it, not because it’s above the 50% cutoff, but because the study is not transparent.</p>
<p>You CAN get that vaccine if you want, just go overseas to countries that are taking it, it just won’t be as good.</p>
<p>If you don’t want a mRNA vaccine, get the J&amp;J one, which is a different more traditional technique and has been studied for longer.</p>

        <p>If you don’t want an mRNA vaccine, there are other options like J&amp;J. It’s a modified adenovirus based vaccine (by way plenty of other vaccines are not the inactivated type.  There are several different technologies used for vaccines. https://www.hhs.gov/immunization/basics/types/index.html). </p>
<p>So you want to take the coronavac vaccine?  You trust a vaccine that hasn’t made it through clinical trials in the US more than those that have?  Outside of China, it’s only got emergency use authorization in third world countries.   You might want to look at the effectiveness of it as well (50%). It’s significantly less that of the vaccines in the US.  The mRNA vaccines are over 90% and the J&amp;J was 66% and above. </p>
<p>There’s nothing fishy about it.  Last year governments around the world including the US had to incentivize and make preorders on vaccines.  It was unknown which vaccines would be available the soonest and work.  So the richer nations gambled on companies that had a better track record, better potential delivery schedule, and advice by the experts.  Poorer nations contracted what they could afford and what hadn’t been locked up already.   You have the ability to get better vaccines because you live in a more affluent nation.  </p>

<p>As I said, J&amp;J is a modified adenovirus.  That is it’s purpose.   We have been using this technology for decades now.  I’m not sure I understand your rationale about the spike protein.  Assuming that the covid spike protein is a “bioweapon” or in anyway harmful by itself, you believe that the sars-cov-2 virus that codes for the spike protein is “a million times safer” than the vaccines that code for the same spike protein?   Both ways you are being exposed to the same spike protein.</p>

        <p>No, the virus will replicate it far more than the vaccines will.  A single virion is covered in these spike proteins (hence their name).  This virus will replicate in a cell until the cell bursts open from having so many viruses in it.  Then those viruses will infect other cells and do the same thing.  This can result in a exponential growth rate.  Additional the virus and free spike proteins spread throughout the body.  With the vaccine this does not happen.  Both the mRNA and adenovirus based ones are non replicating.  They also do not result in cell death.  Less than 1% of the generated spike proteins leave the injection site.  Sufficient protein generation was a problem with mRNA vaccine development for a while.</p>

        <p>The virus will be able to generate a lot of protein only if the immune system is weak, but in that case the virus itself is more of a problem. According to the recent studies, quite large amounts of spike proteins are accumulated in various organs after the vaccination.</p>

        <p>Any level of infection that is detectable will generate lots of the protein.  That’s what several of the tests are looking for.</p>
<p>As for the study you are referring to.  It doesn’t say what you think it does.   It was talking about the distribution of the broken down lipids through the body from the liposome delivery system.  It didn’t even contain the mRNA sequence for the spike protein.   It also not fair to say that they accumulate as they break down and leave the body.   After 300 hours the lipids were no longer detectable in any organ except the liver which is expected.  After 6 weeks they were completely purged from the liver as well.</p>

        <p>The studies explicitly describe the growing concentration in the ovaries. If the lipids are broken down at the injection site, why would they travel to the ovaries? Are they broken down? All of them, or just some percentage? Genuine questions. And why do we have to rely on a couple of studies, that seemingly haven't scratched the surface of full potential/consequences, for a technology that is applied in such a widespread manner and with such zealotry.</p>

        <p>Questions are good.  Sorry, this is so long, but I want to do my best to answer your questions.</p>
<p>I may not have been clear and some clarification might be needed.  It was the liposomes that are breaking down into the lipids.  The liposomes are comprised mostly of lipids (fatty acid molecules).  A liposome is a type of vesicle which are spherical lipid bilayers similar to the plasma membrane of a cell.  The term liposome is just the term for when the vesicle is made artificially, although I've seen liposome also used for natural contexts too. You may also hear them called lipid nanoparticles.   Cells use vesicles (liposomes) all the time to package nutrients and waste within themselves and then to secrete and send to other cells.  The mRNA vaccines package an mRNA strand within the liposome (you make also hear it called a nanoparticle) for delivery to the cells.  Encasing it in a liposome helps protect it from the immune system and allows for the strand to be inserted into the cell.  Once insertion happens part of the liposome may join with the cell membrane (lipid bilayer) for a period of time and the rest break loose.   Either way, the lipids are freed at some point and they travel the body.  The body has many uses for lipids which is why they distribute over the body.  Lipids degrade over time through several different metabolic processes, especially within the liver.</p>
<p>To directly address your questions.  They travel to the ovaries because they travel all over the body.  Only 0.95% of the lipids make it there after 48 hours.  There are other organs that receive larger quantities like the spleen, bone marrow, small and large intestines, adrenal glands, and the liver (16% of the lipids traveled there within just 48 hours for disposal).  Anti-vaxxers just keyed in on the ovaries (they love to make claims about vaccines and sterility).  The quantity goes up because the quantity at the injection site is going down so it just being distributed through the body. The ovaries aren't out of line with the other tissues in the body especially once you account for size. However, it does not accumulate in the ovaries nor any of the other organs (maybe the liver since the liver breaks lipids down and filters them out of the body so it does capture them temporarily).  Those levels go back down over time as the body metabolizes them and removes them.  After 300 hours, they are only detectable in the liver, and after 6 weeks not even there.  So 100% are gone at that point.  I don't have the data points, but it probably follows an exponential decay.</p>
<p>So I think there is a misconception and a notion that because you're just now hearing about these technologies that they are that new and not well studied.  In the case of liposome-based drug delivery, they have been studied in vitro since the 70's, clinical trials in the 90's, and the first approved drugs in the late 90's.  Since then more drugs have come out and our ability to use liposomes has increased greatly.  Specific cell-targeted liposome drug delivery has come a long way in recent years (think cancer; instead of having broad-based chemo drugs that affect all the cells in your body, the liposomes are encoded to attach just to the cancer cells and deliver a kill shot.  Chemo drugs work great at killing cancer but they also kill healthy cells.  As such you can only use so much at a time without killing a person.  This allows the cancer time to mutate and become resistant.  With this technology, you could deliver a chemo payload large enough to kill every cancer cell with just one or two shots without harming the healthy cells).</p>
<p>MRNA technology is similar. mRNA technology dates back to 1989 and with the first successful trials in animals in 1990.  Progress was stalled for about a decade and a half while technical hurdles had to be overcome (evading the immune system and getting the ribosomes to generate a sufficient quantity of the desired proteins).  Around 2005 or so, progress started up again and you'll see a number of studies and research.  In the last decade, it really arrived. You'll find a bunch of studies and works on the subject.  It may surprise you to learn that there have been a number of mRNA vaccines already developed before the Covid vaccines. They have created ones for Rabies, Zika, Flu, HIV, and cancer.    Several of them have made it all the way past clinical 2 trials in humans successfully in addition to the animal trials.  They just haven't done clinical 3 trials due to cost.  Human trials (especially trial 3) are expensive and elaborate so you often have to pair with large Pharma companies to pay for it.  With Covid, the money was there upfront so Pharma companies were willing to pony up the cost.  These particular vaccines have studied in mice and monkeys (studies are available), then they made it through clinical trials 1-3 (studies are available), data submitted to the FDA is available, and since then large population studies have come out further illustrating the safety and efficacy.  There are ongoing clinical trials for pregnant women and children.  Currently, the vaccines are being scrutinized heavily.  They stopped J&amp;J temporarily to investigate 6 cases of blood clots (with one death) and they spotted the potential myocarditis issue with less than the 323 confirmed cases.  Safety isn't being skipped. </p>
<p>As for the speed of the timeline of vaccine development.  They discovered that survivors had antibodies to the spike protein (so they knew their target for the vaccine) and once they sequenced the genome of the virus to see the gene responsible for the protein, they had mRNA candidates within days using technology from the earlier mRNA vaccines and studies (like the study you referenced).  This was a huge time saver (traditional candidates take longer), then they did the aforementioned trials in mice and monkeys.  Once that was good, they applied to the FDA and other agencies to allow them to do human trials.  Due to the governments prepaying them and relaxing some regulatory hurdles, the pharma companies did concurrent human trials (normally, pharma companies won't do this.  You don't want to pay for trial 3 if it fails in trial 1).  So while each clinical trial was the same length as normal for a vaccine, by overlapping them they saved another large chunk of time.   Finally, the money paid (detecting a pattern here?) and the EMA allowed the companies to expedite production and distribution (again more time).</p>

These mRNA vaccines from cancer, AIDS and what not look approximately as trustworthy to me, as these covid blod-clotter concoctions. Mainly not because of the technology utilized, but because of the institutions, whose evaluations I am supposed to trust, yet which have deep conflicts of interest. Overlapping trials? That does not make any sense. And the fact remains that there is no long-term data and the trials have not really been completed, just as you said. If the trials for pregnant women and children are still ongoing, why are vaccines pushed on pregnant women and children? Would you ever allow the notion that maybe the authorities just aren't very ethical? And there certainly were many more cases of blood clots than just 6. They are there in VAERS. If VAERS, which is organized by the official institutions is not trustworthy, why are other things (yet the ones that could justify increasing control over society) coming from the government trustworthy? So, yes, safety is being skipped, it is implicitly states in the manufacturers' own documents.</p>

<p>You might what to check again.   Doxil was the first and it was approved in 1995.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;These mRNA vaccines from cancer, AIDS and what not look approximately as trustworthy to me, as these covid blod-clotter concoctions. </p>
<p>You're thinking of J&amp;J which is not an mRNA vaccine.  There have also only been 36 cases (6 initial cases was enough to trigger the pause) found of these blood clots out of 11.8 million people provided the shot which is why the link is not clear (Also I think the cases are dated from inoculations before the resumption from the 10 day which makes it weirder and less likely.).   Assuming that J&amp;J is responsible, that would give it incident rate of .0003% so not exactly a "blood-clotter concoction."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Mainly not because of the technology utilized, but because of the institutions, whose evaluations I am supposed to trust, yet which have deep conflicts of interest. </p>
<p>Well, let us remember that clinical data was peer-reviewed and approved by the FDA.  The distribution of the vaccines have been closely monitored by world governments and independent studies have already been published.  With your line of thought you're going down, you might as well turn your back on modern medicine.  This is how all drug development has been done.  Even OTC drugs are done this way. </p>

<p>The way they did this (again Operation Warpspeed (terrible name)), reduced the regulatory hurdles of getting clinical trials going and supplied the funding for the trials. This enabled Pfizer and Moderna to start doing clinical II trials on a different population set through the FDA by giving them all the results and all the data requested. </p>
<p>The way they did this (again Operation Warpspeed (terrible name)), reduced the regulatory hurdles of getting clinical trials going and supplied the funding for the trials. This enabled Pfizer and Moderna to start doing clinical II trails on a different population set while clinical I trials were still going.  When clinical I trails ended, they proceeded to clinical III trials on yet other population sets. So clinical II trials were overlapping with clinical I trials and clinical III trials.  This saved time.  When you do your laundry, you don't wait to put the second load in the washer until after the first load is out of the dryer and folded.  You put the second load in the washer as soon as the first load is out of the washer.  Each wash cycle takes as long as before, but you save time overall because you overlapped. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;And the fact remains that there is no long-term data and the trials have not really been completed, just as you said.</p>
<p>So what do you define as long-term?  Most drugs approved by the FDA have clinical 3 trials going on for years after the FDA approves them.  The clinical 3 trials are still ongoing because they are analyzing them to see how long immunity lasts and what happens when another shot is given.  </p>
<p>Of course, there are unethical people, but the number required to pull off a global conspiracy of this scale and continue to maintain is not conceivable.  You are talking about having   Neither the mRNA nor the proteins persist for more than a few days and we've covered the liposome duration.  They have to do damage within a short time frame of no more than a few months (and a few months is being generous so far every potential side effect has been within a few weeks).   The only semi-lasting change is to your immune system.  And this is where we have witnessed all of the side effects, actual and potential -- headaches, fever, inflammation, blood clots, myocarditis. It's not like in 3 years your immune system will suddenly go nuts because of something that you did now.   If it did we would have all been dead millions and millions of years ago. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; If the trials for pregnant women and children are still ongoing, why are vaccines pushed on pregnant women and children? </p>
<p>Pregnant women aren't being pushed.  If you go to the CDC website, it explicitly tells pregnant women that tests are still ongoing and that clinical trials and studies haven't found anything yet.  It tells them to talk with their doctor about it before making a decision.  </p>
<p>As for children, only Pfizer is currently authorized for age 12 and up and that is because they had clinical trial data for that age range.  The other ones are still doing their trials. By this fall, Pfizer will have completed clinical trials for younger child, but until they aren't getting it. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Would you ever allow the notion that maybe the authorities just aren't very ethical? </p>
<p>Of course, there are unethical people, but the number required to pull off a global conspiracy of this scale and continue to maintain is not conceivable.  You are talking about having scientists and business people within the divisions of each pharmaceutical company; enough people within each major government's agencies; countless independent doctors and researchers around the world.  How many of the world governments are at odds with each other?  Yet not one person has blown the whistle.   And to what end?  What is the gain that they seek?  Microchips (No), Power (No, the restrictions are lifting), Money (No, The amount of money paid to companies is small in the grand scheme of things. Besides how many large businesses suffered immensely during the pandemic.  The world's economies will take years to recover from this mess).   </p>
<p>So let's play Occam's razor. What's more likely, this grand, impossibly complex conspiracy that is just rehashed ideas from other conspiracies? Or that a virus (of a nature that epidemiologists warned us about for years) rose up and killed and harmed countless millions around the world (something that has happened many times before).  Then with a combination of dedication and expertise by scientists, some luck (characteristics of this virus), and a butt load of money that we were able to find vaccines for it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And there certainly were many more cases of blood clots than just 6. </p>
<p>Yes, there are 36 cases of this form of brain blood clots which is higher than the statistical norm. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;They are there in VAERS. If VAERS, which is organized by the official institutions is not trustworthy, why are other things (yet the ones that could justify increasing control over society) coming from the government trustworthy?</p>
<p>Who says VAERS is not trustworthy? VAERS is a reporting tool, but it is not a causation tool.  The entries made in VAERS are investigated and analyzed, but an entry in VAERS doesn't equate to cause and effect.  That's what data mining and researchers are for.  Medical professionals are required to list events even if they don't think they are related.  So here's an example.  Let's say (numbers are made up), that VEARS had 10,000 entries for blood clots.  Wow, that seems really bad.  I guess the vaccines are causing lots of blood clots. Oh wait, for the number and kind of people administered shots, you would expect roughly 10,000  blood clots in that period of time naturally.  So I guess that means then the vaccines aren't causing an increase. But you would have people on social media screaming about all the blood clots listed in VEARS.  (For the record, they are literally doing this).</p>
<p>As for trustworthy, there are some bogus entries.  There was a famous example where an anti-vaxxer reported he developed HULKism after being vaccinated.  After investigating, the entry was removed.</p>

<p>Fair enough. Liposomes are not as much of an issue as inserting mRNA into cells.</p>
<p>&rt;the link is not clear</p>
<p>Vaccinated people have suffered not singular, but multiple blood clots, in a very short time, usually despite young age and no identified previous underlying conditions that would make such a result more probable. This has happened with all lipid nanoparticle or viral vector vaccines. These cases can be found in the media. Not all of them have been reported to the VAERS. And there seems to be a reverse correlation between time passed since the vaccination and a probability of complication. All of this suggests a very strong link to me.</p>
<p>&rt; you might as well turn your back on modern medicine.</p>
<p>Modern medical theory has some flaws, inaccuracies and instances of unreproducible research. Modern medical practice is a failing institution, which has only recently demonstrated its problems by administering artificial ventilation on an inappropriately large scale without proper indications.</p>
<p>&rt;The clinical 3 trials are still ongoing</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&rt;By this fall, Pfizer will have completed clinical trials for younger child</p>
<p>Aside from turning profit, I don't see any reasons to do this.</p>
<p>&rt;the restrictions are lifting</p>
<p>Not in Britain, not in Canada, not in France, not in Chile, not in India, not in Australia, not in New Zealand, not in many other countries, not even in California when we remember about the vaccine passport push there. And even if they are lifted, the authorities already promise to put them again when the flu season starts.</p>
<p>&rt;The amount of money paid to companies is small in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>Until the governments compensated them.</p>

<p>The poor people, yes, will take years if not decades. The rich never had any real problems to begin with.</p>
<p>&rt;grand, impossibly complex conspiracy</p>
<p>A guess there is a cliche about sinister men in black suits opening a secret door and gathering in a room made from stainless steel, or covered in priceless art instead, to discuss their evil plans. Nothing like this kind of cartoonish super-villainy is necessary for actual conspiracies to take place. (Though one could point to the existence of Epstein island or Claus Schwab's clothing preferences) No need to create secret societies, all components are already there. The governments already have these agencies, called Special or Secret services, whose entire raison d'être is conspiracies. There is this class of ultra-rich, who, irrespective of whether they have inherited or hoarded their wealth, consider themselves superior to the lowly peasants, who must be poor because that's what they deserve. If power and money were not the point of their existence, they would have rid of these things long ago, yet they continue in their insane pursuit. And when one lives in the ivory tower, separated from natural human experiences, with delusions of grandeur and superiority, crazy ideas are no longer crazy ideas but masterpieces of a genius. And the longer these privileged people suffer no consequences, no matter what they do, how divorced from ethics they become, the more emboldened and self-absorbed they become. While slavery, tyranny, feudalism are no longer palatable, even with their kind of influence and power, these same things "with extra steps" attached not only go unnoticed, but become ingrated into "normality". Soon, their life is all but enforcement of these "extra steps", which, like lies, tend to become more convoluted and absurd as time passes. The elites do not necessarily engage in synchronization of their plans, but merely act in perverted logic of their elevated social class. This social class probably works as a mad conspiracy-generating machine, but only some of these are put into action. Occam's razor works only with certain conspiracies, where you would wonder who would ever benefit from them. In this case we have the motive (power), the means (the various restrictive measures, often nonsensical) and the opportunity (the virus). </p>
<p>&rt;for the number and kind of people administered shots, you would expect roughly 10,000 blood clots in that period of time naturally</p>
<p>The old adage about lies and statistics. When you try to apply overall population statistics (the age is just one category out of many, after all), you will wonder: why haven't I seen anyone suddenly getting a blood clot or having a heart attack? Why are there videos of people having adverse reactions at vaccinations sites, yet you would struggle to find similar instances in other settings. And frankly, I have been extremely skeptical of these vaccines from the beginning of their development. It seemed, time was the only measure and proper protocols didn't matter. I though they would be a disaster, yet I didn't expect them to have not long-term, not short-term, but immediate side effects. They have surpassed my fears. These "small increases" are nothing compared to what's coming, I am afraid.</p>
<p>&rt;There was a famous example where an anti-vaxxer reported he developed HULKism after being vaccinated.</p>
<p>Mass media have made equally extreme, but opposite claims, about curing cancer and Alzheimer's disease, for example.</p>
