    <strong>An interesting discovery by a C-19 charitable fund.</strong>
    <p><p>Some weeks ago I came across this very interesting discovery by Steve Kirsch, the founder of the C-19 Early Treatment Fund (CETF, <a href="https://treatearly.org"><code>treatearly.org</code></a>). You may have seen him on Dark Horse Podcasts.</p>
<p>This segment will be a bit long. TLDR: using CDC's own data, Kirsch had shown that the C-19 vaccines caused a sharp rise in unexplained deaths, and the limitations in VAERS.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>VAERS.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>One issue with the US' VAERS database is that cases are vastly under-reported and under-counted. AFAIK reporting to VAERS is voluntary, but once a doctor or a healthcare worker decides to report, he/she must ensure the report is factual, as reporting false information to VAERS is a criminal offense.</p>
<p>With that, we can assume that all cases (6,985 today) are all authentic, the only issue being under-reporting.</p>
<p><strong>2. Another database?</strong></p>
<p>Kirsch found another CDC datasheet that not many know -  <em>Weekly Provisional Counts of Deaths by State and Select Causes</em> (source: <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Weekly-Provisional-Counts-of-Deaths-by-State-and-S/muzy-jte6">https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Weekly-Provisional-Counts-of-Deaths-by-State-and-S/muzy-jte6</a>) which is updated every Saturday. The database records the number of deaths in the US in one week, categorised into causes of death including C-19.</p>
<p>One column (column O) is of particular interest: deaths attributed as <em>Symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings, not elsewhere classified</em> (code R00-R99), or in short, <strong><em>unexplained deaths</em></strong> (UDs).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/2szxpvd8i0971.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0c3c63e3bcf4339e8976546a8fabb4ecf421c6d">Figure 1</a></p>
<p>This is where column O comes into play. From Jan 2014 to Dec 2020 (7 years), the weekly average number of unexplained deaths was 629.</p>
<p><strong>3. Sharp increase in unexplained deaths</strong></p>
<p>C-19 vaccination in the United States commenced on Dec 14, 2020.</p>
<p>The vax program was accompanied by a stark increase in unexplained deaths per week. See figure 2.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/soy0htnsl0971.png?width=248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f6ad7289cc30ccbfe0492b29970aa6bf12411c7">Picture 2</a></p>
<p>The weekly unexplained deaths did not increase by a lot, even if we take into account the "worst of the pandemic" in 2020. But it tripled in the 6 months since the vax program began in Dec 2020. Something is very wrong here.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows the annual total of unexplained deaths, from 2014 to the first half of 2021.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/ir9iow9im0971.png?width=246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=afb73eb5e40d3984c9dd985900be3096f7db89ec">Figure 3</a></p>
<p>In the last 7 years, unexplained deaths per year hovered around 30K. We barely reached one half of 2021 and the number of unexplained deaths had exceeded the previous years.</p>
<p><strong>4. C-19 Vaccines killed 4 times more people than VAERS recorded ?</strong></p>
<p>This is the methodology that Kirsch used in his presentation.</p>
<p>When Kirsch made his presentation, 25 weeks have elapsed since the vax program began on 14 Dec 2020.</p>
<p>The last number of weekly unexplained deaths just before vax program = 836. Kirsch used this as what he called a "baseline value".</p>
<p>A total of 47,332 unexplained deaths were recorded between beginning of vax program and Kirsch's presentation. Hence 47,332 - (25 * 836) = 26,432.</p>
<p>So we can interpret it like this: compared to the same 25-week period a year ago, 26,432 more people had died for no reason at all.</p>
<p>Instead of a baseline value, I simply replaced 836 with the 2014-2020 weekly average of 629. Hence 47,332 - (25 * 629) = 31,607. Meaning that 31,607 more people died for no reason at all, compared to the same 25-week period a year ago.</p>
<p>So we may be assume that fatalities from the C-19 vax is somewhere between 26,000 to 31,000 people, or 3.8 to 4.5 times the number in VAERS.</p>

<p>It truly is an eye-opener.</p></p>

        <p>That is such an excellent record and I guess it makes sense that it'll be put under unexplained deaths because it's too unusual for it to be anything else. </p>
<p>I'll be saving this post, and it is a lot better than Vaers. So for the COVID Vax they're definitely only counting around a quarter of them but even it is alarming and already exceeded the last 30 years.</p>

        <p>Cool post. Similar to using excess deaths - the deaths need to be accounted for in some way and seems like you identified where they are showing up</p>

        <p>Thank you. Confirms our suspicions. Depopulation unfolding in front of our eyes, but they won't listen or heed a word from us. Frightening</p>
