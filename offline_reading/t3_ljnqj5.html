        <p>Have you even read through the ‚Äúproof‚Äù you just linked? 
It‚Äôs a list of people who have had the vaccine, and also happened to die...<em>not a list of people who have died from the vaccine</em>.
Nearly half the reports I read on there stated that they had no side effects before dying (some died just hours after with no symptoms so it couldn‚Äôt have even been by vaccine). They even stated that they died ‚Äúfrom natural causes‚Äù for gods sake.</p>

        <p>National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1987. </p>
<p>"NCVIA's purpose was to eliminate the potential financial liability of vaccine manufacturers due to vaccine injury claims[1] to ensure a stable market supply of vaccines"</p>
<p>In other words, vaccines were injuring too many people and the liability was bankrupting the makers, so instead of making their products safer, congress just outlawed suing vaccine makers.</p>

        <p>The pill is 99% effective if used totally correctly, but on average in real life is 91% effective because people sometimes forget to take it.  And if you meet a woman and she says she's on the pill, even if you believe her, you might be wary about whether she takes it properly every single day. Just as someone who doesn't want to wear a mask might not be totally honest about having gotten two doses of the vaccine and then waited two weeks.  </p>
<p>The pill also has potential side effects that sound pretty serious and, yes, people who oppose the pill make lots of claims on the internet that it kills people via blood clots and other cardiovascular issues.  And good luck suing.</p>

        <p>Gadz, so much of it.  There just seems to have been so many contradictions since this whole thing started.  But where the vaccines are concerned, I'm close to positive that I've read in different places that they're merely intended to reduce the severity of symptoms and complications....but then I'm told that's not the definition of a vaccine.  Then there's the bit about it having been approved for emergency use only:  Is that supposed to mean every person on the planet is in an emergency situation?  Then I read and I'm told again &amp; again about how these vaccines were (somehow) so stringently tested and therefore safe.  But now that more people are getting it, and more side-effects are being made apparent, I'm suddenly seeing articles about how, yes, there are side-effects....but these only prove that the vaccine is working.  Well, working or not, why weren't people told upfront about the potential side-effects?  Because facial paralysis and uncontrollable tremors and spasms doesn't sound to me like the definition of 'working' or safe.  Blah blah blah.  I'm either far dumber than I realized, or this whole thing is a real mess.</p>

        <p>Well, I haven't been able to believe everything I've seen posted in this sub.  But I can't believe everything I see posted in subs that blindly assume we're being told the whole truth, either, because I've seen the amount of corruption that's out there and where a lot of it is coming from.  I'm just not sure which is worse yet - being wrong about them lying to us, or being wrong about them telling us the truth.  Till will tell.</p>

        <p>Sure, everyone should draw their own conclusions since that's  the healthy thing to do. As they say, always take everything with a greain of salt.</p>
<p>I personally think they lying to us is way worse because even if you ignore this sub entirely there are just too many inconsistencies in what the "experts" say/have said so far. That and the consequences of them lying might as well have lasting effects world wide in comparison to a few towns who were wrong in the hypotetical scenario that the "experts" always gave us all the information and never distorted anything that would get in the way of their interests.</p>

        <p>If all it does is reduce the severity of symptoms, then considering that most people have very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all... there‚Äôs no compelling medical reason for most people to take it. There‚Äôs certainly no reason for anyone healthy under the age of 40 (and that‚Äôs a conservative limit) to take it.</p>

        <p>But that's part of the dilemma for me, in trying to figure out what is and isn't true.  I know three people now who've gotten it:  One was elderly, and he died.  And I'm hesitant to blame his age because of the atrocious conditions of the LTC facility he was living in.  I mean, he started out alone with just one other gentleman in his room, both of them negative.  The rest is too long to go into.  And then I know two young people who got it as well - early 20s and late teens:  The first recovered, with no apparent complications; the 2nd fell into a coma, eventually came out of it, but lost her pancreas....and they're saying she had no other conditions that they could find.</p>
<p>So it's hard to know what to believe.</p>

        <p>Everything you‚Äôve personally seen is perfectly consistent with my comment. What‚Äôs lacking is context. </p>
<p>For example, the flu is not, and never has been, considered a big deal for the general population. Yet the flu is in fact far deadlier for children and young adults than covid is. Every year, there are at least thousands of people in the US who personally know a child or young adult who dies of the flu - but that doesn‚Äôt mean that the flu is particularly deadly (it‚Äôs not). </p>
<p>In a large sample, you will always have some extreme cases (for example, 20 year olds who die from the flu). The larger the sample, the more cases you‚Äôll have. The US is a large sample. </p>
<p>Look up the stats on the number of teens/young adults in the US who have died from covid. You will find that the number is exceedingly small. For example, last I checked the number of covid deaths of children from 5-17 years old was 82; average annual deaths <strong>from the flu</strong> for that same age range is about 300. </p>
<p>As far as complications other than death ... <strong>all</strong> viral infections cause organ damage/inflammation to some degree. Triggered diabetes? Heart damage, etc? These all happen in some tiny percentage of cases with <em>all</em> viral infections, including the flu and even the common cold - but they are outliers. </p>
<p>As for the two young people you know, one of them had the normal experience, and one of them had the extreme ‚Äúoutlier‚Äù experience. This should not impact your assessment of the risks. </p>
<p>Follow the data, not anecdotes.</p>
<p>That said, data isn‚Äôt much comfort when you happen to be or know one of the outliers. I am very sorry for your loss.</p>

        <p>Thank you, first of all, for not only being civil, but also kind.  Whatever else is going on out there, I think I'm reaching my limit with people from both sides who seem to just enjoy the drama and tearing each other down.</p>
<p>You could be 100% correct in what you're saying.  But the comparison of Covid versus the flu doesn't work for me, because we don't yet have the same benefit of hindsight with Covid.  I mean, all of us are still in the infancy stages when it comes to understanding this new virus.  Because of that, I can't trust that whatever appears to be happening right now, we can't still be thrown for a loop or several as this whole thing continues to unfold.  And then where odds and stats are concerned, they don't work for me either (anymore) from having been hit more than once in the past when the numbers said it was almost impossible.  The numbers are still relevant to me to a degree, but I also realize now that it's really all a gamble that anyone can easily lose.</p>

        <p>Thank you as well! I think these are important discussions to have; even if no minds are changed, understanding different perspectives and maintaining friendly dialogue is valuable.</p>
<p>&rt; But the comparison of Covid versus the flu doesn't work for me, because we don't yet have the same benefit of hindsight with Covid.  </p>
<p>Fair enough. We do have a year‚Äôs worth of data on deaths by age range, however. Would you agree that that is at least a starting point for comparisons? </p>

<p>As much as I have strong opinions on this, I agree that you are right - it is <em>possible</em> that some weird twist will come out as we learn more. </p>
<p>Is there anything in particular that makes you concerned that covid is likely to have worse consequences (or otherwise be substantively different from other coronaviruses or viral infections) than we‚Äôve seen? </p>
<p>I‚Äôd very much like to look into it. </p>
<p>&rt; And then where odds and stats are concerned, they don't work for me either (anymore) from having been hit more than once in the past when the numbers said it was almost impossible. </p>
<p>Honestly, I don‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs any way to overcome that unless you‚Äôre a robot. </p>
<p>If you‚Äôve won lotteries from hell multiple times, I totally understand adjusting your expectations based on those experiences - it‚Äôs just how any human would naturally react (our brains are terrible with stats in the best scenarios, and prioritize personal experience because for most of human history that was the right call). </p>
<p>So I‚Äôd love to discuss any evidence-based issues with you, but I won‚Äôt try to persuade you to feel or think differently - I‚Äôd likely feel the same with your experiences. I certainly hope you won‚Äôt ‚Äúwin‚Äù any lotteries with covid!</p>

<p>I think even this is impossible to answer right now, because until it's over, we can't be certain that this even is the starting point.  We could be sitting here 1, 2, 5 years from now thinking, wow, we knew nothing about this virus in 2021.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;As much as I have strong opinions on this, I agree that you are right - it is possible that some weird twist will come out as we learn more.</p>
<p>What strong opinions do you have?  I'm sincerely interesting in hearing, if you're interested in sharing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Is there anything in particular that makes you concerned that covid is likely to have worse consequences (or otherwise be substantively different from other coronaviruses or viral infections) than we‚Äôve seen?</p>
<p>No, I don't think so.  For me, it hinges on how much of what we're being told is true and how much of it is false, and then the nature of the lies being told by either one or both sides.  And since we're unlikely to hear any confessions even if certain people are lying, then we've in large part been left to just sit and wait and see.  And to try collecting whatever solid information we can find along the way.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Honestly, I don‚Äôt think that there‚Äôs any way to overcome that unless you‚Äôre a robot.</p>
<p>I was eventually able to overcome much of the emotions that were involved, so that hasn't been a problem in trying to figure out what's what here.  What I can't forget is the corruption I witnessed, from a system that I once trusted as much as anyone else to look after me and even save me.  Unfortunately, the evidence for it is mostly anecdotal still, shared between people who've been there....and with not enough people on the inside, still, who are willing to speak out except in whispers.  So I have little to offer in terms of the kind of evidence you would need.</p>
<p>And same to you - I hope you don't win this lottery either, sincerely :)</p>

        <p>Couples at risk of getting pregnant (because no female is ever at risk on her own) sometimes do use multiple forms of birth control, since no single form is 100% effective except total abstinence.</p>
<p>But if a man were told that he could take a shot that would be a 95% effective contraceptive, it's not likely he'd want to use the condom on top of it (unless he worries about STDs).</p>
