    <strong>"Turn off your TV"</strong>
    <p><p>I remember just thinking, "Turn off your TV". You never really had to deal with this shit if you didn't want to. Let's say you had a business to run, that would be one of the only things on your mind. But I'm afraid it's different nowadays. When I turn off the TV, I still see propaganda everywhere. I see fear muzzles out in the streets, the stores have bullshit policies, and there's always so many people that you know who are hard-core doomers. I can't go run a business like back in early 2020. Now you're always hit with, "wear a fucking mask. Policies! Mandates!", it's just bullshit. Maybe instead of turning off the TV, we should turn off the world. Where's the power button for stupidity anyway?</p></p>

        <p>I feel like "turn off the TV" is the laziest, most simplistic advice.</p>
<p>I barely watch TV. I still hear Covid ads over the radio. Or see billboards with #WearAMaskSaveLives. Or encounter "Masks Required" signs at every business I go to. Or encounter masked zombies and fanatics. Or people jumping away from me because they are terrified of "disease vectors" like myself. </p>
<p>There's no escape.</p>

        <p>Exactly this. There is no TV in this household (well, I live alone..) for that very reason. We unwittingly subjective ourselves to subconscious guidance the moment we engage in <em>programming</em>. Just as with OP, neither of us are ruled by the fear.</p>
<p>I'm in my mid 40's. Back when I was 14 I watched an ongoing riot from my Northern Irish bedroom window. With eyes glued on to the now disbanded police force, the RUC, observing how they lobbed one plastic bullet after another into the early hours. Morning arose but instead of heading off to school as per normal, I switched on the TV to eagerly await the BBC News report on the nights events, and there it appeared.</p>
<p>Newscastor spoke off the riot, the police response and how only one plastic bullet was fired. One? I saw them when my own eyes. I saw them. It was at this point that I woke up. I used to scoff when told the BBC are full of lies, like, right? How the B.B.C. stood for the BriishBullSh!1Corporation.</p>
<p>Few nights later I couldn't help overhearing the theme to the USA show "COPS" when the lyrics something along the lines of "Bad boys, bad boys, what are you going to do when they [police] come for you?" the presenter would repeatedly say the words to the effect off "They will hit you, they will beat you, you can't run".</p>
<p>At this point you realise the programming is literal, it is real and in your face. You pay for this.</p>

        <p>Yep, the programming and propaganda has been something that's existed for as long as the spoken word. It's just unbelievable after thousands of times we've been through this cycle, people will still fall for it! We lack critical thinking skills as a society. People are dumbed down to live comfortable lives and not question the figures in charge.</p>

<p>Yes, but turning off the TV still helps immensely.  So does social media abstinence and unsubscribing from default subreddits.  Seeing the day-to-day shit is still annoying, but for the most part it's just stupid signs and people who are wearing muzzles but otherwise going about their lives.  It's there but it's mostly benevolent at this point.  Whereas  Social media and news media, on the other hand, go to extremes with this stuff, scream in your face about it, and do nothing but try to spread panic.  Turning off the TV is still an enormous step away from all the negative vibes and doomer bullshit.</p>

        <p>I know. I've been away from media for years, I was never really into it. However, it seems that you don't have a choice when it comes to a muzzle. People will harass you in public if you don't wear it. I had it happen three times! Y'know, during the 2012 Calender Scare we could've turned off the TV and hung out with friends and go to the park or a restaurant without seeing anything about it. Now they're trying to control every aspect of our lives. "You can't do this, can't do that". It's everywhere now... I can't escape it even without TV or social media.</p>

        <p>The television is one of the worst inventions of the last century, in terms of the effects it has had on people. </p>
<p>I worry that we're starting to see, though, that the internet and smartphones are even worse. </p>
<p>It is interesting to think about how these lockdowns came about at around the time the generation not raised with televisions in their houses were finally fully retired, and at around the time the generation that were brought up with the internet in their houses were just coming of age.</p>

        <p>I normally despise Netflix, but their recent documentary "The Social Dilemma" was pretty good.  There were parts that were biased politically, that's to be expected, but the parts where they talked about the neuropsychology of social media were pretty creepy.</p>
<p>I think we'll see some sort of brain-computer interface in the next decade or so.  Something non-invasive that you wear on your head.  At that point we'll basically be the Borg from Star Trek.</p>
