    <strong>I Don't Believe You Care</strong>
    <p><p>I refuse to believe you give a fuck about my Gran's well being, or anyone else's for that matter. No one cares this much unless they're walking around like John Coffey from Green Mile, permanently tuned into the misery and suffering of others around them, and even then they'd probably kill themselves to escape the torment. You are fucking lying. Virtue-signaling does not mean you care; it is a cheap imitation of empathy. You are the real sociopaths.</p>
<p>You're the type of person to tell someone expressing suicidal thoughts after losing their job and sanity over this bullshit to "jUsT sHuT uP aNd wEar a mAsK". Your narcissistic need to appear as if you care has destroyed our economy and left society deformed and twisted; a fucking freak show of triple-masked morons gladly bending over for an anal probe. How fucking dare you.</p>
<p>I don't know what retarded realm of reality you're operating on but I imagine I'd need an ice-pick lobotomy performed on me by a surgeon suffering from severe Parkinsons to get there. I cannot fathom the mental gymnastics you must go through to convince yourself this has all been worth it, that the government's insistence of "just two more weeks" isn't actually just the cries of a petulant, spoiled child screaming for "FIVE MINUTES MORE" on their favorite video game before bedtime.</p>
<p>Just take your cocktail of useless vaccines and continue to blame us when the government decides to once again move the goalposts, despite the vast majority of us begrudgingly adhering to your draconian, ever-changing rules out of fear of being beaten to death by a mob of masked moral crusaders hypocritically breaking social distancing protocol or being carted off by the police for thought-crimes to an undisclosed facility for "re-education". It won't change the fact that you don't care: never have, never will.</p></p>

        <p>One of the most prolific doomer posters on my facebook timeline literally posted something about the coronavirus being "Boomer remover" - this was back when our media was telling us it was a nothing-burger.. before restrictions.... When he implied that I didn't care about his grandma I just replied with his own words a year ago in a screen capture.</p>
<p>He promptly blocked me.</p>

        <p>Exactly, I don't believe it for a second. Its all just tribalism with them. </p>
<p>There's been so many times on twitter or on reddit where I'll see a detailed post with sources breaking down the damage of lockdowns and showing how it'll cause more death (and misery) than covid, it nearly always gets handwaved by prolockdown people with something like "oh there'll always be harms in a lockdown"</p>
<p>Unicef said back in May lockdowns could kill 1.2 children in developing countries but thats just a small trivial issue compared to someone dying from covid apparently</p>

        <p>I've taken to calling these people "child suicide advocates" since I'm using the same logic they are. If us non-believers are responsible for killing all the grandmothers around, then these lockdown enthusiasts are responsible for all of the suicides and depression - which has been extraordinarily high in young people - taking place in the world. </p>
<p>You'd be surprised how angry that makes them.</p>

        <p>There is a pretty convincing argument to be made that there really is no such thing as altruism and even the seemingly altruistic things such as helping and old lady are actually rooted in being motivated about feeling better about yourself for doing it as opposed to actually helping her.

        <p>I sorta just touched on this elsewhere (check my comment history). And this is a thought I've been having about this 'pandemic'  </p>
<p>Back when this all unraveled in March, there was serious political chaos. There weren't two mainstream camps. It was all individuals, people, sharing info and coming to their own conclusions. We were willing to listen to the government about the restrictions because they still had <em>some</em> credibility. I was, at least. I believed this virus was gonna kill 5% of the population. Others figured it was at least somewhat dangerous.  </p>
<p>In that time of '2 weeks to slow the spread', I felt like I lived in a country for once. It was a very brief feeling I couldn't grasp, but it was unreal. I'd awkwardly walk past people and we'd make eye contact and smile. I'd see families all spending time together. This one day my mom and I went to this local restaurant to pick up food, and there was a serious feeling of community just interacting with the employees (if you recall masks were completely optional back then).  </p>
<p>...But as time marched on, the façade fell away. We all began to understand, implicitly, that this virus wasn't that deadly. The only thing reinforcing it was the media. And as is the media's specialty, it divided us. If the only thing keeping the virus on our minds is politics, you just <em>know</em> it's gonna be toxic. Prior to this realization, we saw the virus as something to actually watch out for. As cheesy as it was, "All in this together" didn't get on my nerves, because it felt true. It's not true anymore.   </p>
<p>Doomers are the system's bitches. They police you into conforming to mainstream orthodoxy, while simultaneously believing their ideas are original. That's why they're so adamant about 400k deaths and your grandmother's wellbeing. They've convinced themselves they genuinely care because that's how the media has spun it. It's even more obvious when you see them wish <em>death</em> upon you for not listening to the government, even though according to them the government is occupied by white supremacists lmao.</p>

        <p>You're absolutely spot on. I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt at first (though I never truly believed it was that deadly) and it did feel like we were all in it together, working towards something. But nope, we're just getting fucked in the ass.</p>

        <p>Excatly these people could give fuck all about most people before 2020 now that's it's recommend to wear a mask and stay home they act like the fucking messiah and think every life could be saved when's that's just not true at all most of these Covid Deaths are people who were having to make trips to the hospital every 2 weeks because of their failing Heath  if Covid didn't get them something else was bound to take them just because of how weak they are. And it's not disrespect to the old people We will all get old at one point too but it's the sense of realization that's important that your not going to be around forever and making the best outta the Time you got which why so many people comply with the lockdowns just amazes me and There is such a high survival rate of Covid for The relatively healthy it shocks me so many people shake in fear but you can thank the MSM for that.</p>

        <p>&rt; Let us suppose that the great empire of China, with all its myriads of inhabitants, was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake, and let us consider how a man of humanity in Europe, who had no sort of connection with that part of the world, would react upon receiving intelligence of this dreadful calamity. He would, I imagine, first of all express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people, he would make many melancholy reflections upon the precariousness of human life, and the vanity of all the labours of man, which could thus be annihilated in a moment. He would, too, perhaps, if he was a man of speculation, enter into many reasonings concerning the effects which this disaster might produce upon the commerce of Europe, and the trade and business of the world in general. And when all this fine philosophy was over, when all these humane sentiments had been once fairly expressed, he would pursue his business or his pleasure, take his repose or his diversion, with the same ease and tranquility as if no such accident had happened. The most frivolous disaster which could befall himself would occasion a more real disturbance. If he was to lose his little finger tomorrow, he would not sleep to-night; but, provided he never saw them, he would snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren. . .</p>

        <p>I like this. It perfectly applies to the early days of coronavirus when it was still in China and there were just a few cases in the US. Nobody cared. We felt for the victims but it just wasn't our business. Even today, the average person isn't affected by it aside from the restrictions. I still feel for every victim, but it's painfully inefficient to upend your whole lifestyle to prevent further death. But people are doing it anyways because the media is propping it up as something you need to do. If you don't, you're not a "good" member of society.  </p>
<p>Lines up perfectly with my theory that I expressed elsewhere in this thread. I think this quote would be a great tool to explain to someone how we're being unknowingly programmed. Smith is explaining <em>natural behavior</em>, yet it's no where to be found in the doomers who are glued to the TV.  </p>

        <p>When people say "you're putting others at risk" "wear your mask" they really mean "you're putting ME at risk, and you're not following the rules. That means I might be wrong and I cannot be wrong my ego cannot allow it, therefore follow the rules like ME." They either seriously believe you breathing without a mask on will kill them and their family or they want you to be a rule follower.</p>

        <p>Doomers have just rebranded selfishness. The masks (in their twisted minds) are to protect <em>themselves</em>. If it came out tomorrow that COVID <em>only</em> kills those over the age of 65, you wouldn't see another mask ever again. And all the doomers would be shouting "stay the fuck home, grandma, we're done with masks".</p>

        <p>100% compliance is impossible. Many people will starve if they close their businesses or don't go outside and work. This is especially true about the poor.</p>
<p>Secondly, many places that had and have strict lockdowns like Argentina, Germany, New York, California and Belgium have soaring Covid numbers, while Florida and Sweden are far from the top.</p>
<p>Why? Because lockdowns make no difference.</p>

        <p>I see your point about people who aren't in an economic situation to fully lockdown. That part is on the government. They should've been providing relief/stimulus checks in a coordinated manner that actually helped people- not 1200$ and another 600$ six months later, the way stimulus has been handled is not gonna change anyone's problems if they are hurting financially.</p>
<p>My problem is not with people who are struggling, it is with people who don't wear masks, and go out when they don't need to, and make a big show of it and boast about how they aren't "sheeple" because they want to feel special.</p>

        <p>You're just in denial.  You cannot accept the fact that you allowed yourself to be deceived.  Your ego won't let you.  So instead of coming to terms with just how gullible you are, you shift the locus of your pain to some external tormentor.</p>

        <p>Your anger is misdirected here, no offence meant. We don't want lockdowns to continue, nor are we the cause of them in the first place. The number of virus cases do not directly cause lockdown, that's the government. Regardless of what we do the virus will continue to spread. So if you're angry about lockdown, be angry at the government. You have every right to be, they took away everyone's life for a virus that poses a minor threat the the majority of the population, and told you it was wrong to be angry about that. But us, the lockdown skeptics are not to blame here. Almost everyone followed the rules in spring. I did, and we were actually pulling together to try to mitigate the virus at the time. But as the months have passed, it's become increasingly clear that the lockdowns are ineffective and have huge consequences to the wellbeing of our people. A strategy that would have got rid of the virus would not have been rendered ineffective because a small group of people did not follow the rules. A strategy that relies on 100% compliance is doomed to fail when the rules are so harsh. We don't want to hurt you, we're not some demonic murderers. We're just normal people, and it upsets me to be a scapegoat for the failings of lockdown because I pointed out its flaws. Not to mention that lockdown was intended to slow the spread, so following the strategy would logically make the natural curve of the virus take longer. The lockdown could be lifted next week if only we'd try another strategy that puts in place the means to protect the vulnerable while allowing everyone else to live pretty much normally (which would allow us to reach herd immunity naturally and is a far more sustainable strategy).</p>

        <p>I think you’re directing your anger about a lot of different things at people who aren’t actually causing you any suffering.  You’re blaming people for being afraid or angry, when you’re just the same.  Everyone is sick of the virus - the maskers, the antimaskers, EVERYONE.  Stop being so angry and blaming people who have nothing to do with your specific problems and maybe everyone won’t seem like such an asshole. Please take care of your own mental health, no one can step-in but you.</p>

        <p>I've had these same assholes screaming about protecting grandma laugh at me for being upset my dog died and telling me to go kill myself, so no, my anger isn't misdirected. They are actively contributing to the continuation of this charade through their narcissism and virtue-signalling; people are afraid to speak out because of the backlash they'd get from these assholes.</p>

        <p>Virus and lockdown are not interchangeable terms. I am sick of the lockdowns. Even places that have close to zero cases are still locked down and have no plans of reopening. Doing this to people over an extended period of time will likely be more devastating than the virus. People are sedentary, they're drinking more, they're eating unhealthy foods, they have no income, they're depressed, they're not getting sunlight, their relationships are disappearing, the economy is worsening, there are no jobs, the list goes on. So my anger is not misdirected. And there's no light at the end of the tunnel. Dr. Fauci has already said that we'll have to keep most of the mandates and "precautions" once the vaccine is rolled out. </p>
<p>I'm angry at my government for doing this to me and I don't think my anger is misdirected. But I'm also angry at all of the people who say that it's worth it. One of my coworkers went so far as to tell me that people who killed themselves during lockdowns would have done it anyway. People don't like to talk about the downsides of lockdowns. They tell you that you're being negative. They tell you it'll be over soon and to just follow the science. Maybe it'll start paying off eventually. People don't want to believe that their government has any ill intent and I understand that, but I have a right to be angry at them.</p>
