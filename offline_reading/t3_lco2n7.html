    <strong>More stories from retail</strong>
    <p><p>Haven’t done one of these in a while but people seem to like them.</p>
<p>Two guys come in without masks.  First guy comes to register first.</p>
<p>G1: hey do you have any cloth mask, Ah right there cool I’ll take one.</p>
<p>M: ok that’s 10 dollars.</p>
<p>G1: <em>puts it on</em> ah man it’s so comfortable</p>
<p>M: no it’s not</p>
<p>G1: I’ve needed one for a while, it fits so good.</p>
<p>M: ok</p>
<p>G1: ah man it feels good</p>
<p>Guy 2 walks up</p>
<p>G1: hey I finally got a mask it’s so comfortable</p>
<p>M: they aren’t comfortable</p>
<p>G2: they are hard to breath in, hate them</p>
<p>G1: so glad I got one finally</p>
<p>Like he was talking just to himself.</p>
<p>Woman getting photos printed with her daughter.  Has been there for about a half hour and her daughter can’t be more then 8.</p>
<p>Daughter: <em>takes like two steps from her mom towards the candy</em></p>
<p>Woman: stop it, stay close to me</p>
<p>D: <em>says something about the candy</em></p>
<p>W: stay close if you go near someone you’ll get sick</p>
<p>My gut dropped and I wanted to quit my job right then and there. I don’t want to have to hear shit like that and not be allowed to say anything. She went on to buy her kid candy and went makeup browsing. All absolutely essential things when you believe just stepping near another person will kill you.  Disgusting.</p>
<p>Stocking shelves. A toothless old man comes up to me. I know he is toothless because he didn’t have a mask on.</p>
<p>Old man: hi!</p>
<p>M: hello</p>
<p>O: do you like wearing that thing?</p>
<p>M: I absolutely hate it</p>
<p>O: you better!</p>
<p>We talked for a few minutes about the bullshit but he wasn’t interested and getting flyers from me or starting a group.</p>
<p>Few more minor anecdotes about people not masking but not really notable. All in all I am actually seeing less people being non Compliant than ever. It’s a bummer.</p></p>
