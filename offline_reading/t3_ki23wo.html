    <strong>I feel really depressed since another sudden lockdown was announced, with no end in sight.</strong>
    <p><p>My country (in UK) went into an unexpected lockdown 2 days ago. We were planned to go into lockdpwn on the 28th but It was a shock announcement at 6pm on the 19th to take affect at midnight the same day. I struggle with my mental health a lot I have just started a new job and it's stressful and I have a major relationship with exercise its the only thing that keeps my mental health and stress in check. I had 5 days off work and had planned to get in some good gym sessions but now I can't be bothered to do anything anymore without it.</p>
<p>I survived in the previous lockdown by going for long walks on my days off work but it rains so heavily here in winter. I have still gone but I feel seething with rage the whole time that I have to be doing that to get exercise during this ridiculous lockdown. They have said it will be reviewed every 3 weeks but the general consensus is this will go on for months. I don't have the energy for it all anymore and I feel like I'm unravelling a bit. I feel very angry at times then others just empty and hopeless. </p>
<p>I guess the doomers dont really have the 'just exercise outdoors' argument this time and will just have to admit they are content to ruin their health not exercising and eating shit and drinking on the couch all day. Which is fine but others rely on exercise to maintain their mental health.</p></p>

        <p>You mention being shocked by the announcement. Anyone notice that instead of closing things or locking down in a staggered manner, both the UK and numerous US state governments like announcing closures on a whim, sending a mad rush of people to train stations/airports/transport? How inept can they be? We mostly talk about the first world countries here but look up all the laborers who DIED cause they had to walk to their hometowns suddenly and leave Delhi/the big cities with no warning. It’s insanity. It’s madness. Mobs of people rushing to beat these deadlines. Packed trains and planes OK at 11:59 PM but not 12:00. Makes zero sense.</p>

        <p>I don't think the 'masses of people' rushing to the trains was true at all, just another complete propaganda lie. There are crowds at rush hour any day. They come up with these headlines so people have something to complain about, apparently everyone is 'selfish', lol. I'm sure they would enjoy being locked in until Easter in small London rooms</p>

        <p>Stay strong brother or sister. Anyone with any sort of common sense knows these lock downs aren’t about stopping anything. It’s about breaking people. They doomers broke easily, but those like us who’ve resisted is why they’re doing it again.</p>
<p>They’ll crank up the propaganda more and more to blame us for the lock downs while still increasing the restrictiveness until we too break. But we must stand strong.</p>

        <p>It's hard to organize. Facebook, twitter, and reddit will ban you if try to organize a protest against the government. They got around our pesky right to free speech by having corporations block our speech,so the government doesn't have to.</p>

        <p>Hey man. I'm in the uk too.  I was saying for weeks previously that a tier 4 would come before Christmas.  I was right. It's like clockwork.  My only advice I can give is focus on your family and try to limit social media and watching the news. Distraction is the only thing helping me right now. Anything that stops me thinking about this.</p>

        <p>Thank you friend. I am so angry and frustrated by all this that I've been obsessively watching the news and tracking social media comments to see what the general reaction is like. I've been doing it for months now it feels like. You are right about needing to distract myself. I feel like everyone is in some mass psychosis and I don't know why everyone is allowing this to happen.</p>

        <p>Yep. Same here. I've been trying to gather a consensus of sorts, but some social media has become toxic to the point of being unbearable.  Even some of my friends and family members have become more and more scared over time.  It's sad to see.</p>

<p>I can't offer you any solace here, but I've been doing the exact same thing. It's hard to distract yourself when everyday feels like groundhog day, without even having the comfort of a Ned Ryerson to punch in the face.</p>

        <p>The purpose is to have an excuse for why there's (going to be ) a massive recession, which there would have been anyway but people would've questioned it too much if there wasn't an 'obvious' cause. Back in 2008 when there was that recession the banks managed to tide themselves over, print enough money until now, so we were always heading for this - they've made this pathetic virus as an excuse.  I got this info from watching lockdown protest videos and it was kind of hidden within a long video as well, but it's a very obvious explanation</p>

        <p>I feel for you. The UK government has taken a turn for the worse, for sure. It's not that bad where I live... Yet. My gym is still open. Just a thought,  maybe you could try some really kick ass body weight routine? Challenge yourself to do 100 burbees or something?
Other than that, I wish you strength. Keep strong.</p>

        <p>I'm not being glib, I know how grey British winters are &amp; I don't envy your situation. But you can still nest &amp; be healthy.</p>
<p>Pushups are great &amp; keep me going for an hour or so! Create a warm space where you can read. If you don't read much, start with short bursts &amp; increase over time. Reading helps me avoid reddit for a while, which can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>The Expanse series is awesome if you like sci-fi.</p>
<p>But honestly, fuck these people &amp; sorry you've been put into this shitty situation. Do whatever you can to keep your head above water. Good luck.</p>

        <p>I normally spend 90mins in the gym lifting weights, 4x per week. Bodyweight exercises just don't cut it for me. Especially for months on end. Loads of people on social media berate people who rely on gyms. I saw one woman suggest to a competitive bodybuilder that she could use 'tin cans' for a home workout. Its just insulting.</p>

        <p>yeah it's worse if you're living in and around London as you're paying rent for a smaller space, it's not like there's some big space to do what you want in like what these politicians have.</p>
<p>I think it's people not being aware of other people's living situations, esp say you're sharing, don't have room for a fan if you get too hot, not enough space to do anything.</p>

        <p>same, are you down south, London and outer boroughs? I got a job down there now I don't know if I'll bother because I'll just be living like a prisoner anyway, no benefits coming with the increased rent of living there. </p>
<p>Have no idea what the job is either thanks to Con-vid restrictions. Just had enough.</p>
