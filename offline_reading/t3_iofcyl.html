<p><strong>I can't post this to</strong> /r/conspiracy <strong>as my account is less than 2 months old. I think it's important that awareness about this is spread, as it won't be on the mainstream media, and we're talking about</strong> <strong><em>a potentially serious attack on the right to free speech and protest in the UK.</em></strong> <strong>I would appreciate it if someone would cross post this to</strong> /r/conspiracy, <strong>or if others would share this post/a similar post/the video or the information around.</strong></p>

<p>Footage of the protest being shutdown above \^. The footage demonstrates an <strong>organised and well coordinated shutdown</strong> of a group of people <strong>who had just spoken about child abuse and coverups</strong>. Which begs the question. <strong>Why was there an organised and well coordinated shutdown of a talk about child abuse and coverups?</strong></p>
<p>While the people attending the talk (I'll repeat - <strong>about child abuse and coverups)</strong> were pushed out of the street, <strong>by a well coordinated and organised Metropolitan police force,</strong> and told to disperse, an extinction rebellion protest was allowed to continue not 500m away on Parliament square.</p>
<p>When questioned about this, police stated the decision to selectively police protests was <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeyHaddon/status/1302519238301712384">"not made at their level"</a>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>There are demonstrations organised on September 19th &amp; September 26th in Trafalgar Square, with expert speakers &amp; NHS whistleblowers planned to talk.</strong> Get yourselves down if you're interested in hearing what the whistleblowers and experts have to say.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cressida Dick, the head of the Metropolitan Police (London police service), was on a radio show encouraging the humiliation of members of the public into <a href="https://www.metro.news/police-chief-cressida-dick-lets-shame-shoppers-who-spurn-masks/2086853/">wearing face masks</a>. As far as I'm aware, <a href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/summary-what-offences-may-be-committed-if-someone-shouted-or-approached-another-person">this is illegal.</a> <strong>Over 5 million people in the UK have asthma. The head of the Metropolitan Police has just incited harassment of over 5 million people who are legally exempt from wearing face masks.</strong></p>
<p>???</p>
<p>Was any of this covered by the mainstream news? Not that I'm aware of.</p>

<p>We are witnessing important weeks in our lives.</p>
<p>I've also seen with my own eyes policemen and women in their vans packed together not wearing face masks. I've heard reports from NHS and key workers that not many people are wearing masks. None of the professional football or rugby players in the UK are wearing masks. You see masks scattered all over the pavement - surely if they were such a dangerous biohazard more of an effort would be made to dispose of them. As far as I'm aware not a single member of the Metropolitan police has died from covid 19. <strong>Why does/how has all of this happen if "covid 19" is so dangerous?</strong> That is, of course, supposing that it is in fact dangerous at all.</p>
<p>I've also heard reports from NHS workers that if they talk to the media when it is not sanctioned by more senior members of the organisation <strong>that they will lose their jobs</strong>. Why is censorship necessary if the virus is so deadly? Surely that should speak for itself? That is, of course, supposing that it is actually dangerous and the mainstream pandemic narrative isn't a complete lie which requires censorship in order to believed. <strong>The truth doesn't require censorship to be believed</strong>.</p>
<p>If you're convinced about your view regarding the narrative I challenge you to look at some of the resources I have linked. If you have nothing to hide then you shouldn't be afraid of looking at them.</p>
<p>Additionally there are a group of people opposite downing street in London trying to hold the government to account over their disproportionate lockdown measures.  </p></p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing but you're preaching to the choir here. Our minds don't need changing. </p>
<p>I'm glad you posted though. I live in London and find getting information about protests beforehand is really difficult so I will look into those two links.</p>
