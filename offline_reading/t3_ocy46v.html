    <strong>Media Gaslighting: Thoughts on the way forward</strong>
    <p><p>Many of us were already skeptical of mass media long before this whole saga. Their methods are varied and insidious; simply looking at two articles from the same outlet - side by side - would cause most people to question their sincerity.</p>
<p>Who remembers the processions of trucks loaded with corpses last year? People dropping dead in the streets of China? Hospitals crammed with dying patients of all ages, even when cases were low? These are images and stories that - based on what we've now observed - simply don't add up. If the virus were truly that deadly, when cases soared, we'd be seeing deaths in numbers unparalleled in modern history. If the virus were truly a threat to society at large, we would not need a 24/7 media campaign to remind us of that threat. We would <em>all</em> know someone who has died of covid. You need only look at some of the posts and comments from Branch Covidian subs to see how deep the brainwashing rabbit hole goes. Claims of a 20% mortality rate. 20%! Of course, the media and our Silicon Valley overlords care little for misinformation of <em>this</em> kind. Fear is their bread and butter. </p>
<p>Currently, the biggest fight we have on our hands is for the right to bodily autonomy. Specifically, the right to refuse the experimental injection they're marketing as a vaccine. For most of us, this right still exists. Some of our friends in places like India, Pakistan and Russia are not so lucky.</p>
<p>The media has been using many abusive techniques to force our hands. Pumping out endless articles claiming that the vast majority (I heard 90% at one point) have taken the injection. Days later, they post a bunch of articles claiming that vaccine hesitancy is a massive issue, usually accompanied by some hamfisted smear piece about how we think it's a reptilian conspiracy or that we're all mentally ill. A logical person looking from the outside would easily see that the two stories contradict each other. If almost everyone is complying, "vaccine hesitancy" can't be a massive issue.</p>
<p>I liken it to the old police interview trope, where the cop comes in and says "The game's up, your partner has told us everything". Between the relentless stream of media propaganda, and social media doing everything in its power to disrupt communications between skeptics, it's all a campaign to isolate and gaslight us. To make us feel like we're a minority. To make us feel alone. To make NPCs think <em>we're</em> the ones stopping them from doing the mindless shit they used to do before the virus.  </p>
<p>I am pleased to see that a dedicated site for this community is in the works. Independence from these propaganda platforms is the only way forward. Currently, we can't even assess our own numbers, and this is exactly what they intended. If we stand a chance of resisting what's coming, we need to stop relying on platforms that hate us. And sadly, we must come to terms with the fact that due to either self interest or genuine brainwashing, anyone capable of waking up has already done so. With all the glaring inconsistencies, hypocrisy and abuses of power on full display, only a fool or a tyrant would be comfortable.</p></p>

        <p>Well said, however, I don't think everyone with the potential to wake up is awoken yet. I think you'll see once the NWO goes  full court press with masks and lockdowns again because of "Delta plus ultra double mutant", we'll see a significant portion of people fence riding who will shake themselves from their cognitive dissonance.</p>
