    <strong>A question about the Johnson and Johnson Jab - was the FDA study a fair test?</strong>
    <p><p>I don't worry much about jabs - I decided I'm not getting one.</p>
<p>But it doesn't hurt to go back and revisit some of the early studies that different pharma companies submitted to the FDA / EMA.</p>
<p>Janssen and Janssen / Johnson &amp; Johnson was today's read.</p>
<p>FDA summary Sheet:</p>
<p>https://www.fda.gov/media/146304/download</p>
<p>To summarise the numbers:</p>
<p>So 43,783 participants, 21,895 vaccinated, 21,888 placebo</p>
<p>5 deaths in the placebo group, 0 deaths in the vaccinated group.</p>
<p>So - statistics - the data can be presented two different ways! Guess which way the advertisers choose...!</p>
<p>1 - The vaccine prevents 100% of Covid Deaths (0 out of 5)</p>
<p>or 2 - The vaccine prevents 0.022% of Covid Deaths (5 out of 21888)</p>
<p>The benefit is small, but the benefit is there. Apparently.</p>
<p>But it did get me thinking - what about people dying of other causes? If you take 40,000 and follow them for a month, some of them will die. Because thats life.</p>
<p>In 2020, the USA had a death rate of approximately 8.2 citizens per year per 1000 individuals. Therefore, in a group of 43,783 people we might expect 360 deaths, 180 in each group.</p>
<p>I think the Johnson and Johnson study only origianlly reported on the subject's status at 28 days after injection. So 1 month. </p>
<p>If we are anticipating 180 deaths in a year - might we anticipate 1/12 of that number in a month? Maybe 15 deaths in each group? </p>
<p>Perhaps deaths are seasonal, Perhaps people behave less riskily when they are participating in a medical study? Perhaps 15 deaths in each group is not realistic, but we should expect a few, surely?</p>
<p>and we should expect them in both groups, jabbed and non jabbed.</p>
<p>So I wanted to see the data / see the statistics for deaths from "non-covid" causes</p>
<p>Official Science Journal write-up for the New England Journal of Medicine:</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33882225/</p>
<p>To quote:
&rt; three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19-related), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19-related).</p>
<p>So - that makes me curious!</p>
<p>Because if the group demographics were equally weighted, (i.e the same number of 85 year olds in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups) you'd expect similar background mortality in both groups.</p>
<p>But we don't</p>
<p>We see a background death rate of almost 4 times higher in the non-vaccinated control group compared with the vaccinated group (11 vs 3)</p>
<p>Because our "Covid deaths" are at a similar elevated number (5 vs 0, as opposed to 11 vs 3)</p>
<p>Were the control group more sickly / vulnerable? </p>
<p>Is this statistically relevant?</p>
<p>A fair test would require the two different groups to be as similar as possible, the only thing being different is the jab or no jab - then we can tell what effect the jab has. If your control group contains more vulnerable people, with other serious medical conditions, the trail data suddenly becomes a lot more questionable.</p>
<p>A supplementary appendix contains more data:</p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2101544/suppl_file/nejmoa2101544_appendix.pdf</p>
<p>page 35 age distributions, page 43 comorbidities. </p>
<p>I only post this because I found it interesting... and it gets you thinking... how 1 elderly person dying in a trial conducted in a foreign country leads to american magazines and newspapers advertising 100% effective vaccines...</p>
<p>in a market worth billions and an apparent political project to reshape global society...</p></p>
