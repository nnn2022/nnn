    <strong>I'm not saying it was a full on False Flag.. but.. ðŸ‘€</strong>
    <p><p>I'm on my way up and I keep thinking I'm going to peak but I just keep going right now (65mg fruit snacks) and frankly I needed to talk about this: </p>
<p><strong>There was</strong> <em>SOME</em> <strong>degree of State complicity in the Boston Marathon and Oklahoma City Bombings.</strong> I'm not saying it was a full fledged False Flag, but to completely reject the notion that the FBI or other elements of the intelligence community did not have greater prior knowledge than the official narrative suggests is to completely reject reality. </p>
<p>I would go a step further and say that the State, likely, instigated the attackers and perhaps, <em>perhaps</em>, provided psychological or even material support, potentially in either case just as a means to 'apprehend' a perpetrator that they knowingly set up. Which is a practice we <em>know</em> the FBI has engaged in. And then the situation escalated beyond their control and they took every step to ensure that information that the FBI made a whoopsie and allowed people to carry out a terror plot that the FBI organized as a sting. </p>
<p>Further still, and I'll admit this is far more speculative, I don't think it's beyond the pale to entertain the idea that entrenched political interests would organize a plot to associate a <em>radically antigov</em> movement with fanatical violence to discredit them and use the prevailing social stigma around the 'antigov' movement to justify an increased centralized policing apparatus to combat it, while in reality expanding the scope of the police state to encompass more of the entire country. </p>
<p>Nor do I think it's beyond the pale to entertain the idea that entrenched political interests would organize a plot to capitalize off of populist fears and biases born of ignorance and fostered by the media, by radicalizing two troubled young men from a minority faith and providing for and enabling them to do something heinous. In turn using their newfound political capital to grow the foreign policing apparatus (the military industrial complex) in order to pacify the "alien" threat from overseas, while in reality just expanding the bounds of US Deep State influence in the other country's political, social, and <strong>resource</strong> spheres.</p>
<p>Why is this even controversial. At the <em>absolute</em> least you have to acknowledge that they had a better understanding of the threat prior to the bombings. And if we can establish that the original narrative was a political construction, and that we <strong>were</strong> lied to, we should have a blank check to discuss the <strong>extent</strong> to which we were lied to.</p></p>

        <p>What makes you think two kids and a pressure cooker was significant enough that the FBI knew about it and was complicit? Same with OKC, that was pre-internet, pre-9/11, you could get away with a lot more under the radar.</p>

        <p>Good morning. I'm sorry about disturbing the sub's meta. I have never done anything like this. I was completely baked out of my dome last night and in the heat of the moment I thought this was the funniest thing ever written, which is not an excuse for a night of shitposting, just an explanation.</p>
