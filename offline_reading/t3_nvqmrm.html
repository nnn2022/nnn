        <p>A quick google scholar search yields literally hundreds of papers on the subject, how about <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774707?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=010721">this one?</a></p>
<p>Secondly, the vaccination doesn’t provide 100% immunity. From the top of my head: AstraZenica provides around 80% I believe. </p>
<p>Thirdly, this seems like a bad faith argument...but don’t mind me.</p>

        <p>Funny how you attached a link to a article not based on science but on assumptions, heres alittle from it </p>
<p>Results  The baseline assumptions for the model were that peak infectiousness occurred at the median of symptom onset and that 30% of individuals with infection never develop symptoms and are 75% as infectious as those who do develop symptoms. Combined, these baseline assumptions imply that persons with infection who never develop symptoms may account for approximately 24% of all transmission. In this base case, 59% of all transmission came from asymptomatic transmission, comprising 35% from presymptomatic individuals and 24% from individuals who never develop symptoms. Under a broad range of values for each of these assumptions, at least 50% of new SARS-CoV-2 infections was estimated to have originated from exposure to individuals with infection but without symptoms.</p>
<p>2nd they are using the same articles the CDC has attached under their website as proof of asymptomatic transmission which are ALL papers about contact tracing and were done in CHINA, like i said there is no science to support FULL asymptomatuc transmission, where a person has NO symptoms for the ENTIRE duration of their Covid diagnoses</p>

        <p>This is the CDC model , they base their assumptions on peer (and pre) reviewed studies. </p>
<p>You could argue that it’s lower than .75, even as low as .35, but that doesn’t change the fact that you are wrong.</p>
<p>PS: models are THE most important tool in many scientific fields. Funny that you didn’t know that.</p>

        <p>https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/more-people-hospitalized-in-us-areas-with-low-vaccine-rates/ar-AAKRuPv</p>
<p>From the above article:</p>
<p>&rt;The coronavirus might be receding in much of the United States, but it continues to spread in communities with low Covid-19 vaccination rates, where highly contagious virus variants pose a threat to those who have not had shots.</p>
<p>&rt;In Smith County, Tenn., where only 20 percent of people are fully vaccinated, there has been an almost 700 percent increase in hospitalizations for Covid-19 over the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database. In Trousdale, Tenn., where only 23 percent of people have had two vaccine doses, hospitalizations have also surged by 700 percent in the same period.</p>
<p>&rt;The increase is not a coincidence, said Dr. Ted Delbridge, executive director of the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems. People who become ill with Covid-19 now are, “in most age groups, twice as likely to end up hospitalized as people who got the virus earlier in the course of the pandemic,” Dr. Delbridge said.</p>
<p>&rt;Dangerous virus variants are likely to be to blame, Dr. Delbridge said. The variant first found in Britain, now known as Alpha, is deadlier and more contagious than most others and is now dominant in the United States. Last month, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the variant, also known as B.1.1.7, made up 72 percent of U.S. cases at the time.</p>
<p>You can be asymptomatic and not know you have COVID. Even if you show no signs or mild signs of disease, you are still in a contagious condition. How is that too difficult to understand?</p>
<p>It's like there's a vast number of people who think if you can't see a virus, it's not really there. How sad and pathetic is that?</p>
<p>You've all been warned repeatedly, yet you insist that people who've trained for years to respond to health issues are all in on some vast conspiracy. Like children with your fingers in your ears going "Lalalalala I can't hear you!"</p>
<p>We're in for a lot more deaths because of this narcissistic, me-me-me mindset. But you keep on telling yourselves it's all just a vast hoax. Just don't expect any sympathy from me when you inevitably contract COVID. You choose to put yourselves at risk, so have fun with the results of that reckless, self-absorbed behavior.</p>

<p>I see these anti-vax, Q-anon folks as pure drama queens. They need an enemy; they need to "feel" oppressed by something to explain their shitty lives; they need to "feel" smarter than the average bear.</p>
<p>It's pure narcissism with no regard for reality or for the health and safety of their communities. We'll always have self-deluded narcissists, unfortunately. The same sorts of folks had shit fits when they made seatbelts and baby car seats mandatory.</p>
<p>But you and I can try our best to counter their self-absorbed arrogance so they can't reel in more ignorant people to their ignorant cause.</p>

        <p>He was simply asking for the science, The higher ups Cant possibly say "Follow the Science" when there is none to follow,  who keeps the higher ups in check? Its suppose to be us, they are not above us nor below us, these are necessary questions are they not ?  </p>

        <p>The higher ups keep themselves in check by peer review and pressure. They understand science and are of good character, that’s why they get to be higher ups. Do you demand that a mechanic explains to you every little detail about how your car works before you agree to drive it, or do you simply follow the driving instructor’s instructions ? </p>
<p>The fatality rate for driving is roughly 15 times that of the covid vaccine, by the way…..</p>

        <p>Right so there is no government corruption by anybody in power because they are keeping themselves in check and making sure there is no greed nor hate in their hearts because they are holding theirself to this high standard, </p>
<p>And lets not even get into the less then 1% fatality rate for Covid, and how they have skewed the numbers, but thats another story. </p>

        <p>You're calculating fatalities rates incorrectly. The "less than 1%" figure assumes every single person has contracted the virus. Fatality rates are determined by taking the total fatalities, divided by the total cases. </p>
<p>For the US: 598,000 deaths divided by 33.4 million cases = 1.79%</p>
<p>For the UK: 128,000 deaths, 4.53 million cases = 2.82%</p>
<p>Globally: 3.75 million deaths, 174 million cases = 2.15%</p>

        <p>I understand your stance, however the fatality rate is way off, just a few days ago Almada county had to reduce their covid death count by 25%, literally</p>
<p>They are 1 of the few areas being transparent about how they classified covid deaths, that mixed with the horrible PCR testing the 1.79% Fatality rate is far less, </p>
<p>The facts are their its just people are not piecing the it together, the MSM is literally not covering the important facts</p>

        <p>I will say that the Alameda county change to counting is interesting, though from every source I can find it only affects their local count, the state count hasn't changed because the new counting guidances Alameda county are using are the same as the states, whereas their previous guidances were less strict. So actually that change doesn't change the stats for the US as a whole.</p>
<p>Also, saying that the fatality rate is far less than the currently available data showing 1.79% is pure speculation. The Alameda county change (which is only a local change as explained) would still only account for a change of around 400 deaths out of 598,000, a margin of error of 0.06% to the national figures.</p>
<p>Most medical institutes actually are being transparent about how deaths are counted, I can't speak to the US as a whole since I don't live there and I'm not up to speed on it all, but in the UK our national health service has always published the guidances on how our statistics are calculated, including any reasons for changes if and when they have happened and our fatality rate is still much higher than the "less than 1%" you claimed before.</p>
<p>The facts are there, but increasingly, I think people are ignoring the facts that disagree with their narrative (on both sides of the argument) and then extrapolating from small data they agree with to create grandiose claims that cover an infinitely larger scale. I had one person earlier today cite a report about asymptomatic transmission as being evidence against the theory of asymptomatic transmission, but then when I pointed out the conclusion of the very study he linked disagreed with what he said, his response was "yeah but they were paid to say that". He literally said he wanted to take the numbers he agreed with because "they were right" but ignore everything else around it because "they were clearly forced to say that". This kind of cherrypicking data is exactly why neither side takes the other seriously.</p>

        <p>Of course there is government corruption, but they’re not TOTALLY corrupt. Assuming everything they say is a lie is just as stupid as believing everything they say. In both cases, your decisions are determined by them rather than by your independent judgement. Do you seriously believe that ALL the doctors in the world are part of a conspiracy to make you take a vaccine that controls your brain or turns you into a lizard ?</p>
