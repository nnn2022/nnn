    <strong>Crazy family members.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a 23 yr old girl in nursing school and my sister who is 12 years older and lives in my moms house with her 14 yr old makes me wear a mask in the house except when I am in my room. I have grown such resentment to her due to her controlling and rude behavior. If you voice opposition or a different opinion she shuts it down immediately. She actually said that she believe that I don't care if she dies of COVID. Then in the next breath she said "I wouldn't care if you were just putting yourself at risk but you are endangering us". All because I go walk around our local shops every once and a while. And by that I mean maybe once monthly. She hasn't gone inside anywhere since this has started she gets everything delivered. I don't have that luxury. She is an insane hypochondriac and believe I will give it to her. She becomes so vicious if I try to stand up for myself. I have asthma and having a cloth over my mouth 24/7 has definitely exacerbated my asthma.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If she or her kid got it I would be concerned about them. My first thought would be, oh my gosh, I'm worried about their health. If I got it her first thought would be about herself, and her second reaction would be to blame me for bringing it into the house.</p></p>

        <p>Get the fuck out at all costs, immediately.. Your relationship with your family will be ruined for life if you don't get out of there.</p>
<p>My brother thinks masks are good in public which I don't agree with, but at least he doesn't wear it when we are hanging out!! Rest of my fam thinks its BS</p>

        <p>Unfortunately she won't "let" me work either. It will be an all out war if I try to go to work. So I can't make money to get out until I am done with school, which is still another year. She is a bully who controls every move by everyone in the house, and if I defy her I will be made into the sacrificial lamb.</p>
<p>I am not a total COVID skeptic and I'm not sure where I stand on masks in <em>general,</em> but I know this is a total power play on her part. It's pushing me to the other side of hating masks, which is not really 'me'. I am open to other ideas surrounding the topic, though, while she is self-important and a know-it-all. She thinks anyone who takes off their mask for a millisecond, or goes to the mall, or goes and sees a family member at their house, is a brainless neanderthal that needs to be put down.</p>
<p>What bothers me most is a lot of leftists (I am <em>liberal</em> but not a leftist) use this as an excuse to pander hate and control over others. There are a lot of people who genuinely want to use masks reasonably to protect themselves and others (like myself). But there are many who use it as a tool to divide and control. The masked are on the good side, the non-masked are on the bad side. And the non-masked need to be corrected and denigrated.</p>

        <p>I will definitely have a read! Not sure my sister would be receptive though and it may do more harm than good.</p>
<p>I am in university in an accelerated nursing program. I would prefer to work. If I could I’d probably only work 16 hrs. My program recommends we work less than 20 hrs due to the rigor of the program.</p>
<p>I worked at a CNA (nursing assistant) before the pandemic and loved it.</p>

        <p>She is the definition of "doomer". One time I told her to try not to think so negatively, that it has a very low death rate, and not to let it control her whole life. She said, "Oh, okay Trump!"</p>
<p>For a lot of people this is purely political.</p>

        <p>This is a perfect illustration of the degree to which so many have been fully, completely brainwashed.</p>
<p>She thinks that calling you the last name of a sitting president of the United States of America is the mother of all insults. </p>
<p>OoOooOo you called me the leader of the free world! Ba-ZING!</p>
<p>As you have noted, your sister is an authoritarian control freak. This will only get worse, not better. Thanks to media brainwashing, she feels fully deputized to abuse and terrorize those close to her.</p>
<p>It sounds like you aren’t wired to be defiant and stand up to her. </p>
<p>That’s unfortunate, because what she really needs is for somebody to beat her at her own game. When she punches, punch her back twice as hard.</p>
<p>If you aren’t prepared to do that, I echo sentiments expressed elsewhere in this thread — leave the house as soon as you possibly can.</p>

        <p>I have stood up for myself to her many times. But it has proven to make things worse, not better, for me. Ironically, I'm an extremely vocal and outspoken person and it pains me to have to lie down and die. But I also have to think if this is worth my sanity, especially when trying to make it through a very rigorous nursing program. Besides, when we fight, it isn't a conversation, because she just yellows loudly over me that I am wrong and she is right. Her self-righteous tone makes me nauseous.</p>
<p>Sadly, I've come to the conclusion that constantly trying to fight her would be more harmful than succumbing to her control.  </p>
<p>My mother has given her an ultimatum to get out by the summer. Hopefully she will do it and me and my mom can live in peace.</p>

        <p>With all due respect, how can she “make” you? Dissent, and when she freaks out on you tell her you will comply only if she can provide sufficient evidence that the scientific community has reached a consensus on whether flimsy, cloth masks actually do anything. (They haven’t)</p>

        <p>I guess you’re right, she technically can’t make me. But she can make my life hell if I defy her rules. If I said that about cloth masks she would just make me wear an n95 which gives me terrible eczema on my neck.</p>

        <p>If it were my crazy sister, I’d let her slap me, scream at me until she gets tired of it. Shes got to wear herself out sometime. I’d tell her if she’s so concerned, she should protect herself and wear an N95. Her health isn’t your responsibility. Not to mention, you’re the one educated IN HEALTH!</p>

        <p>Thank you for your support. She does wear an n95 but still requires us all to wear masks. The kicker is that I have all my classes online and go to a facility once a week with no COVID patients and 3 other classmates. The risk is unimaginably low.</p>
<p>In her view she is the ultimate authority on all things health even though she has no background in medicine. She actually said to me that she thinks I shouldn't be a nurse because I don't take this seriously.</p>
<p>The craziest thing is I do take it seriously. But I refuse to stop living my life. I need human interaction, I need to go out and see people. I need to go to the store every once and a while just to window shop. </p>
<p>Yes we could completely eliminate all risk of COVID contraction, get all our food delivered, never interact with anyone outside. But at what cost? For a disease with a 99% survival rate? What will you be left with when the dust settles?</p>

        <p>Just go on a big tangent lecture, start a huge fight, and make it extremely uncomfortable for me to be outside my room. Also she'll turn her 14 yr old my nephew against me.

        <p>I'd tell her I'm cutting her off forever if she doesn't stop the controlling behaviour in my own house. If she keeps it up, do. Might knock some sense into her.</p>

        <p>I can't imagine how awful it would be to have your own family turn on you. I'm still short of a few months to be old enough to leave, but I'm so so thankful that my family are on the same wavelength as me. Even if things are back to normal next week what's done is done. Maybe sometime you may come to forgive her but forgetting about her acting like that won't do you any good. I wish you the best of luck!</p>

        <p>Thank you so much. Yes I definitely agree some damage can't just be erased. Forgiveness is more difficult when the person isn't sorry at all. Maybe I can have a relationship with her at some point but it will never be the same.</p>

        <p>My sister will yes. She gets right up on her high horse and lectures and belittles us. Even when I simply asked her to ask us (my mother and my little brother) nicely to put our masks on she protested saying that it is a life and death situation and something very important. Translation: "I can talk to you any way I want as long as it's for a 'good cause'."</p>
