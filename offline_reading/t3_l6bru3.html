    <strong>Election rigging in 'the age of COVID'</strong>
    <p><p>A Boris Johnson masterclass:</p>
<p>1) Change COVID-19 fatality stats from 'any death within 28 days of a positive test' to 'any death within <em>60</em> days' to keep the figures high (the average infection-to-death period is just 17 days).</p>
<p>2) Ban political parties using door-to-door canvassing ahead of elections in May but permit paid delivery. This makes no difference to infection - one person is still delivering parcels to houses. But the major parties can afford paid delivery, and upstart parties can't.</p>
<p>3) Claim political opponents don't have a 'valid reason' to be outside campaigning even though major party activists are also campaigning (see the arrest of London mayoral candidate Brian Rose).</p>
<p>4) Make all public assembly, including protest, illegal.</p>
<p>Sickening tactics, but utterly typical of bully-boy aristocrats who think governing is their God-given right even though they are paid very well by multiple hedge funds and still can't find their own arsehole in the dark.</p>

        <p>You have forgot mandatory daily urine sample / drug test. That would have the added advantage of stimulating the economy with an army of Piss Troops moving the yellow liquid to the labs.</p>
