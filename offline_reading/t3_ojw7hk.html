    <strong>LEGITIMIZE THE BATTLE FOR BACK TO NORMAL (A rant of a stigmatized conspiranoic in the age of spectacle, biowarfare and domestic surveillance)</strong>
    <p><p>Guys, Mods, Comrades, PEOPLE!:</p>
<p>We have to buckle down and take the war against disinformation more seriously. I just came across this very damaging post:</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ojapw4/covid_19_side_effects_019_parents_almost_kill/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</p>
<p>You can clearly see that, even though the footage is very impresionable, the characters already seem to have experienced this before so the kid is not going through a jab reaction. More and more people are on our side now bc the vax adverse reactions are too many and too much of an impact on their lives. So please, don't fuck it up. Respect the gained territory!</p>
<p><em>(Although I'm speculating that we might be getting infiltrated but that's too far fetched although can't rule it out)</em></p>
<p>These type of posts make us look bad. They discredit our honest mission of trying to help people out. Of offering other sources, offering a different, more probable narrative of this whole thing, if anything, a different perspective to break the paradigm they're stuck in, which is <strong>Believing the state wants the best for us.</strong></p>
<p>These posts are the reason why we end up being labeled as selfish or having complexes of grandiosity, or in the worst cases, when we become stubborn, we end up leading the rest to believe we think we're better for "knowing the truth": WE DON'T. There is no fucking truth anymore in these times. We can't hold ANY truth to anything anymore. That's why it is important to <strong>do the research and back up our sources</strong> , bc the leaks of evidence are being re-written as you read.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-truth</p>
<p>We can't let our loathe for the eugenists-capatilists rule a debate. As conspiracy "theorists" (bc we literally don't have the physical evidence to wake people up) we only rely on inviting people to use their critical thinking through a healthy debate so that THEY <em>maybe</em> connect the dots and possibly grasp a tiny speck of how the strings are being moved within the elite class.</p>
<p>We have to become more rigorous with our ways of spreading information and approaching someone who is already against us. We are obligated to do our own research bc <strong>we have to do it for them.</strong></p>
<p>Remember that Complicit theorists get their info through sell-out talk show hosts, bullshit influencers, and in the worst cases, all of the morbid mass-media crap owned by 5 major corporations AND big pharma. </p>
<p>We're just there to help them question what they're witnessing, so if you don't have the sources or you're not entirely sure about what you're discussing, drop the debate. Only accept that you're not well informed yet, but that you'll keep finding more  reliable strings to keep connecting the dots in a logical sense to back up what you already can firmly presume or speculate from your arguments.</p>
<p>The virus is real. Hey, it might be even targeted biowarfare bombs, who the fuck knows by this point! The mutations are real, maybe not deadly but this is their way into our bodies to justify their biosecurity agenda (bio-domestic surveillance).</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/a5-4fjVs1QE</p>
<p>Don't buy and don't encourage the purchase of any "high tech gadgets" (Alexa, Roomba or any brand of those cleaning robots, geo-mapping softwares-- our fucking phones are enough!) more so, remind them these expensive devices were made to have a deeper understanding of all of our behaviors for the elite to milk in unimaginable ways.</p>

<p>Stay strong. Stay skeptical.</p></p>
