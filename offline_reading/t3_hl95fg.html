    <strong>We are no longer the land of the free and home of the brave</strong>
    <p><p>We have become the land of the repressed and home of the terrified.    The US was formed by people who rejected government tyranny and now many of its citizens are literally begging for more government control over our lives.</p>
<p>Sadly, there is nothing to celebrate today.   There is very little independence left in the American people.   Many have lost the ability to think for themselves and instead they blindly follow whatever narrative the MSM is providing. </p>
<p>Instead of a government of the people, by the people, for the people, we have a dictatorial regime that forced our economy to shut down and the effects will be felt for years to come.  Thousands of business were forced to close and millions of jobs were lost.   Lives have been put on hold.  Schooling has been delayed.  Mental health issues.  Suicides.  Increased alcoholism.  The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Incredibly, many states are rolling back their reopening plans and are again imposing arbitrary and unjustified closures of certain businesses that will result in still more job losses and unemployment.</p>
<p>All this for a virus with a CDC estimated overall survival rate of 99.74%.   There are estimates that there are up to 10 times more Covid cases than officially recognized which further increases the survival rate.</p>
<p>I don't know what the solution is but hopefully we will regain some of our collective common sense and July 4, 2021 will be brighter than today is.</p></p>

        <p>I have a bad feeling that come Monday a bunch new stay at home orders will come out.   The governors that can't deal will the political fallout of having their entire state back under Phase 1 lockdown again just before independence day will no longer have that stopping them.</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry but other than for brainwashed people who live there and believe the state propaganda, the USA has not been the land of the free for a very long time.  I was going to say since 9/11, but we can probably go back even further and say Vietnam.  This is just the next evolution.  By the way, when I criticise the USA, I'm certainly not saying it is better everywhere else - to be honest, I see very little difference now between my own country (UK) and the USA in terms of the ramifications and fallout from this fiasco.  Much like 9/11 had global consequences, this pandemic is also having a similar global effect with removal of civil liberties across almost every western 'democratic' nation.</p>

        <p>Yes! I posted this on another thread, but saw someone post on Instagram about how if you are wearing a shirt with an American flag on it today it should be considered offensive. The same people that are working well-paid, cushy work from home jobs are the same people expressing anti-United States sentiment. I just want to scream, okay, then go live in a third world country where you don’t have access to running and water if you hate the opportunities that living in the United States gives you. As someone who comes from a family with several veterans and immigrants, screw these anti-freedom people.</p>

        <p>Lol! I was in no way thanking America for giving us freedom (sorry Americans), I was referring to the British troops that fought for us. Ha! I don't hold onto any resentment towards Americans for getting independence from us but that really has tickled me. I know they came in at the end etc.</p>

        <p>British commandoes in WW2 were fierce.  We're talking, raid a Nazi base and take prisoners just to piss off Hitler fierce.  Brits, historically, are some tough people.  I mean, Hitler bombed London for months and you all still said, "Fuck you, no surrender."</p>
<p>As an American, I'm embarrassed for both of us.  The people who beat the most evil thing in history together literally freaked out over a virus.  Our grandparents would be ashamed.</p>

        <p>It was my great grandfather who fought. I don't want to tell the whole story because I'm sure I'll get some details wrong, but I know he spent a long time in the Burmese jungle with Ghurka's trying to evade Japanese soldiers. </p>
<p>He also lay explosives under Tiger tanks sitting on a bridge, and thankfully he came home. </p>
<p>There are still some very tough Brits, but unfortunately our country has been undermined. Instead of having respect for men, we tell them women want feminism and patriarchy is bad. I think the family holds society together and makes men, women and children their happiest and most productive. </p>
<p>Also the law is not on your side if you are defending yourself/your home.</p>

        <p>Nothing to celebrate this year. Hopefully next year, but I fear for the future of this country. We so willingly flush everything we fought and died for down the drain at the drop of the hat. It took a lot of media manipulation to get to this point, but the fact that people are stupid enough to fall for it is scary.</p>
