    <strong>Covid restrictions on healthcare could have killed me</strong>
    <p><p>I had a bad tooth i was going to get pulled before covid happened, but then everything had closed down and i put it off. Well, it went from 0 to 100 one day and the infection spread to my sinuses. I had to make an appointment asap to get antibiotics before scheduling the extraction.</p>
<p>I havent exactly had money or insurance since this bs started, so i finally find a low income dental clinic to take me. Not only do i have to arrange the income based payments on the phone (which is an unbelievable pain when they ask for documents you dont really have), but it took me over a week to even make that appointment. And i still wont have that or an amount by the time im finished with my script.</p>
<p>I cant schedule this until i get the payment stuff squared away. On top of it, when i went into the building, they were doing temp checks and if you were above a certain temp, they wouldnt let you in. And the infection has a 100% kill rate if it goes far enough and spreads so quickly like you wouldnt believe. Fever is one of the symptoms that means you need treatment now. I was lucky and didnt have one and i messed up by putting it off, but youre telling me if i have a life threatening infection that is so severe i need immediate medical treatment, youre going to deny me treatment because of a virus that has such a small kill rate? What a joke. Am i being punk'd? Where are you, ashton?</p></p>

        <p>Terrible. So many stories just like this. So many people unable to obtain normal treatment.</p>

        <p>Same. I was found to have kidney cancer January of 2020. They postponed my operation until July because all "non emergency" surgeries weren't permitted.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm dealing with something similar right now. Possible infection of a tooth I had a root canal on a few years ago. The lymph node just below the tooth, under my jaw, expanded in size and became sore to the touch. I‚Äôm otherwise not in pain though, so dentists/oral surgeons around here don‚Äôt consider it an emergency and won‚Äôt see me. I‚Äôm lucky to have a family friend who is a doctor and wrote me a script for antibiotics. I‚Äôm hoping that does away with the infection between now and whenever the fuck we get out of lockdown (2025 acc. to Gates?). Fuck this shit. I feel bad for people who have far worse going on. I can only imagine how many have died from deferred care, while all the ‚Äútraumatized‚Äù nurses and doctors are doing their little Tik Tok dances. Good luck, man. If it keeps getting worse, my honest opinion is you should consider flying down to Quintana Roo, M√©xico. Dentists are generally open, charge less than here and the scenery is beautiful. It‚Äôs like Florida but even more open.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, i dont even have the funds for a tooth extraction, let alone a plane ticket. I dont have a passport either.
Its just total bs. I was hoping to wait until the crap was over too, but here we are.</p>
<p>I know its crazy. I have one friend that might have a rare form of cancer and her appointments keep getting pushed back, and she has to go to all of her appointments alone without any support. Its disgusting</p>

        <p>Thanks, yeah me too. It might be adrenal gland cancer, so she's terrified and going through a lot of imbalances. The growth isn't big enough to remove yet, but its enough to really affect her health. Shes been waiting for MONTHS on some answers, and shes a single mom with two kids, i cant begin to imagine how she's feeling.</p>
<p>Someone must have down voted your comment. Really glad cancer is less important than covid and theyd down vote something about wishing someone with a possible terminal illness well. I watched my dad deteriorate and die from cancer when i was a kid, just wait until it happens to someone they're close with, then maybe their opinion would change.</p>
<p>Keep saving lives guys! Good job! Way to spread the love!</p>

        <p>Not just the government. I sometimes feel like regular doctors are as well. It may sound paranoid, but my medical treatments have been so shitty these last few months that I swear, this is all intentional, and medical staff are also in on whatever is happening. To some extent, anyway.</p>

        <p>I cant believe it. I expected temp checks at schools and stuff, but doctors offices and hospitals can use that to turn you away at the door? Wouldn't a better solution be to isolate people with fever or make them wait in the fucking car till its their turn at least?</p>
<p>I am so so fortunate, but i cant imagine how many people werent so lucky.</p>
<p>I bet theyd refuse you and if you died, youd be somehow counted as a covid-death. Cause of death:septic shock, but still technically covid because we wouldnt let them go get treatment because of covid... Makes perfect sense to me.</p>

        <p>After this, I'm writing a will. I dont have many assets, but i cant rely on getting medical treatment if i need it for god knows how long.
I never did because im pretty young, have no major health issues besides this one tooth, and have no kids, but this pandemic changes everything. I know a kid i have a special relationship with that could use the help to do whatever he wants for his future when he turns 18,at least until i (hopefully) have kids of my own.</p>

        <p>Similar story here with the tooth.</p>
<p>I have to fly off to another country, pay ¬£100 x 4 covid tests (2 to go and 2 to come back) so the beauty of ¬£400. And of course, if I turn out to be "positive" I will lose the money from flight tickets. Plus 14 days of total quarantine to go and 14 days of quarantine back.</p>
<p>I have no words and I don't know what to say, but I have to get rid of this goddamn tooth.</p>
<p>For our safety my ass.. Luckily I have the money and the time to do this, otherwise I'd be fucked.</p>

        <p>Wow. Thats ridiculous. Are you in europe where the lockdowns are crazy?
Im in the us in a fairly conservative state, so its not as terrible as that, but its still mind-blowing the hoops you have to jump through when you have an emergency.
My only saving grace is they only cancel elective surgeries and that hasnt happened since march. At this point, its not elective.</p>

        <p>Do you see how this doesn't make sense?</p>
<p>I'm also currently in a 4 day isolation after a Covid test. Even though these jackasses have been saying "But it could take 14 days for symptoms to show up!" If that's the case, then why is 4 days okay now? See, none of this makes any sense.</p>
<p>And no, not advocating for 14 day quarantine. Just saying, they are being contradictory as fuck.</p>

        <p>Its 4 days now? I thought the average time before symptoms appear was 5?</p>
<p>My friend's household had covid, everyone except for him and he never got it. He quarantined longer than his family had to.
If im being honest, i was over there and came into direct contact with all of them just before their positive tests. I never got sick. At most, i felt fatigued and like i was going to get sick for a few days and never did.
I didnt go out in crowds or anything like that, just home and my grandma's basement (ive got an office space over there since i dont have the space and she never goes down there because of the stairs. Funny thing is, she's 95 and goes out more than me. She gives no fucks, shes like "if i die, i die. I lived a full life. If i cant go out to breakfast God take me now")
They didnt tell anyone i was over. If im sick ill stay home, but i can't stop my life for this more than i already have when im not sick. And im not getting put on any list for preexisting conditions so my insurance rates go up when i actually manage to get some coverage.</p>
