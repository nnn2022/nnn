    <p><p>What is wrong with Germany and its people? I ask this myself every time i write a new post about our "New Normal" here, which gets more and more frightening every day.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a 12yr old girl wanted to travel home from her Grandma to her home, like she has done it many times before. This time she was yelled at by the bus driver, who refused to transport her. Because she wore a medical mask. Which is within our (stupid) rules. Children under the age of 16 do not need to wear a FFP2 mask. So she had to wait for 1 hour, because the bus only leaves there every hour. "She cried and was really scared and now she never wants to take the bus again" her mother wrote in a mail to the newspaper.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way, if you sit inside a bus or train, you can take your mask off, if you want to drink or eat. That's perfectly fine. Makes sense, doesn't it?</p>
