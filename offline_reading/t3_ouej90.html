<title>Stop lashing out against people like the users on r/coronavirus or the people in your life that have made a choice to put their trust in one cure or another. They aren’t your enemy. They’re your friends and neighbors and family, and the governments want you to forget that.</title>

    <strong>Stop lashing out against people like the users on r/coronavirus or the people in your life that have made a choice to put their trust in one cure or another. They aren’t your enemy. They’re your friends and neighbors and family, and the governments want you to forget that.</strong>
    <p><p>This isn’t the time to hate or mock people that have fallen victim to the massive amounts of noise being broadcast to them 24/7 on everything from their TV to their workplace break room wall to trucks loaded up with loudspeakers passing through their communities. These are people trying their best to protect their kids and their elderly. These are people who have had their livelihoods ruined, their businesses lost, their relationships broken and their best years of school spent in a bedroom at their parents’ home; all while being told all of it is YOUR FAULT through every outlet they engage with.</p>
<p>Of course they’re going to blame you, they’re only human and you’ve been made the perfect outlet.</p>
<p>So stop hating them back and mocking them for doing something they think will repair the hurt in their life and confirming every bit of bullshit they’ve been trained to think about you all while conveniently allowing them to direct all of their anger at you instead of at the people who lied to them.</p>
<p>Don’t you think it’s odd how Covid, a virus that requires you to go inside, not group together, and cover your face in public while staying away from each other, sprang up like it did <em>right</em> after a period of time in which the world united in solidarity like never before to protest issues around the globe? A period when more and more citizens grew tired of humans being oppressed and got vocal about it in the streets? And how after this initial break out died down and life started to go back to normal, and the world’s focus started to turn once again to the way people were being held down throughout it, we got the second wave and Delta - and a return of around-the-clock fear-mongering? How every step of this virus has been overblown, politicized, and filled with confusing and intentionally conflicting mandates? How EVERY conflicting bit of research is swept aside; how they operate with a religious fever and zeal to keep the headlines churning?</p>
<p>They don’t want you standing with your countrymen. They want you to fight about this or that while they keep you acting like crabs in a bucket skirmishing over which of their boots you get to get crushed by.</p>
<p>So if someone lashes out at you, let them. They’re acting on what they believe is valid information. Hit them with facts, studies, and numbers. Explain why you think like you do, let them see you’re just a human being making a choice regarding your own body just like them. Show them you’re not a bizarre nut job like the media tries so hard to paint you to be, you’re just an informed individual looking at the hard facts and choosing to distance yourself from something you don’t believe to be beneficial to you. And if none of that works, oh well. And if you can’t be bothered to put that sort of effort in to help your peers, just ignore them.</p>
<p>But stop allowing yourself to be used by the world governments in a game of class warfare and social control because someone disagreed with you and exercised their right to make a personal choice for themselves; the same right you are campaigning for. You’re doing nothing but strengthening the average person’s dependence on them through the destruction of the middle class and helping them silence outcry against oppression across the globe.</p>
<p>Both sides of the debate know the response to Covid has been a monetized farce at worst and a massive failure at best. It’s time the anger is directed at who actually deserves it.</p></p>

        <p>I’m sorry but if you are genuinely deluded enough to believe that the government ACTUALLY CARES about your well being and that any For Profit company has your best interests at heart and when they come together glorious things can be achieved like a leaky “vaccine” for a virus that has trouble killing 99.4% of humans and that has more issues than a day one release of a Bethesda game... All the while having your rights, bodily autonomy and livelihoods stripped away from you, by those people while they blame those who do not trust the government or media as the reason these things are happening I’ve got something to tell you, an undeniable lesson taught to those who truly deserve it... You reap what you sow motherfuckers, if you blindly follow leaders who have shown you time and fucking time again that you cannot trust them, don’t be surprised when they lead you off a cliff!</p>

<p>We argue with each other “you’re sheeple”, “tin foil hat” etc </p>
<p>But it stops us looking at those that (mis)govern us and they get away scott free. </p>
<p>I agree with the OP (I think, they’ve deleted their original text). </p>
<p>Take a leaf out of Daryl Davis’ book. He got hundreds of kkk members to give up their robes.  Not by arguing with them.  </p>
<p>There was a guy way back named Aesop who wrote about the sun and the wind and a man with a coat on. I’m sure there’s a moral there somewhere too. </p>

<p>If you look at the subscribers to NNN they just keep increasing in number.  Could this not be people who have opened their eyes either voluntarily, or by a kind friend informing them of the flaws in the media/government’s argument?</p>
