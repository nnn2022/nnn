    <strong>The Coronavirus pandemic from the perspective of a concerned student (don't know which flair is appropriate)</strong>
    <p><p>Hello to everyone who reads this,</p>
<p>I'm posting this here because I have the feeling that it would be downvoted into hell on other subreddits. Also, excuse me, if my English sounds weird, it's not my first language. </p>
<p>So, I still go to school, and I'm having a hard time with all this Covid-mess that is going on. The schools are closed, which means I can't visit my friends (they all live 50+ km away from me). It is really hard without having real social contact with them (only per videochat), because they were the ones who helped me beat depression. Now, when we don't meet regulary, I am afraid, that it might come back. </p>
<p>Also, I absolutely despise online school. It is extremely tiring to sit in front of a computer for hours and learn new information all the time. It way too intense and focused. In school, you can just look out of the window for some time or take a walk in the break between lessons. If you try to do so in online school, it is not effective, because there is always the loud voice of the teacher comming out of the speakers, directly at you. Normal school is way more chill and there are interesting and refreshing spontaneous discussions, which online lessons for some reason do not have. The teacher talks for 1,5 hours and occasionally a student answeres a question with "yes" or "no". I can't concentrate on what is said, so I browse the internet and do not listen, which is a thing that I think many people do. I know that this is a bad thing to do and that I might need all this stuff for the next school year, but I just can't help myself. This concentrated blast of information is just too hard to handle, specially for a longer time. </p>
<p>But one of the worst things is the mask-thing. In my country, you have to wear a mask when you go to any store. Well, that's why I don't go to the store anymore. So many people say "Oh, it's just a mask, it's not a problem." or "If a surgeon can wear it for hours you can wear it when you buy groceries." On the internet, people who don't want to wear a mask are treated like criminals, which makes me really sad and sometimes angry. People have freedoms, right? And if your neighbor makes use of his freedom, you have no right to demonize them on the internet. Well, at least that's my opinion. </p>
<p>I have Aspergers, which means that it is hard for me to read other's facial expressions correctly in general. But over the years and the social contact with my friends, I have learned to interpret peoples expressions most of the time. And now, when I see someone wearing a mask, I'm back to where I started and don't have any clue. I can't see whan people smile or when they look angry, nothing. And with this comes a weird feeling of paranoia. I have thoughts like "Is he staring at me? Am I doing something wrong? Is the woman at the counter looking at me in digust?" </p>
<p>And this feeling is only worse, when I myself have to wear a mask. I can't explain it on point, but I somehow feel like an impostor, or as if I drown in the masses of people, that are around me. It is uncomfortable and stressful. </p>
<p>I dislike watching the news now, because there is always something about this shitty virus. Nobody knows for how long things will be like this. It is most shocking to me that people are willing to accept this as the "New Normal" (god, how I hate that phrase). I don't want this to be normal. The thought, that the world could be like this for months or even years is extremely unsetteling to me. I just want to live my normal life and not worry about this virus. </p>
<p>I'm not scared of the virus itself (because people my age are very likely to survive). I'm more scared of the effects this virus has on society. </p>
<p>Well, that's it. Thank you if you've read through all of this. I don't even know why I wrote this exactly, I guess I just had to get it off my chest or something. </p>
<p>But anyways, have a nice day.</p></p>
