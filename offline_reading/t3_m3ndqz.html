    <strong>Does this feel like a month of flashbacks to anyone else? It's just hard to process everything that's happened.</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like this week especially, has been a time where covid flashbacks have been on my mind quite a lot. I've been playing a video game in my spare time so that I can take my mind off it.</p>
<p>This is of course, around the time last year where everyone across the globe was going insane with the panic buying and fighting over toilet paper. So much has happened in the past year with the panoramic and the whole world being shut down by the government, and it's just really hard to process that level of global insanity with all the craziness.</p>
<p>I'm sure a lot of the world is feeling the same right now. We may be getting vaccinated, but there's definitely a collective trauma because of the panoramic.</p></p>

        <p>I was in jail this time last year. Getting out into the "free" world was jarring, to say the least. It just felt like a bigger jail. It's been a bizarre year.</p>

        <p>Yes. It was Friday a year ago that everything shut down. I keep thinking I’ll wake up and it will start all over again. I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. </p>
<p>In my state lots of things are opening up and it seems like a majority of folks want the old normal. But in the back of my mind I’m scared they’ll try it all over again. Maybe they’ll let us have the spring and summer to enjoy but it’s only a matter of time before they lock us down again. </p>
<p>I have certain foods I can’t eat anymore because I bought them at the beginning of the pandemic when everyone was freaking out about going to the grocery store and shelved were bare. I bought what I could find, and eating was my only pleasure. The food I bought then I can’t even look at anymore, not because I don’t like the taste but because it reminds me of that awful scary time.</p>
