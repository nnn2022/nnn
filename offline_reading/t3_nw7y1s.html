    <strong>The Soyboy Socialists</strong>
    <p><p>This has probably been said before but this is how I see things:  </p>
<p>The whole plandemic was just a trial run.   </p>
<p>In my view, everything we are witnessing has been a reaction to the reality of life being unfair. It's a fact of life that some people are by virtue of their own nature, much better equipped to succeed. Whether it has to do with intelligence, looks, work ethic -- it doesn't matter, its simply fundamentally true that there will be inequality of outcome across individuals.  </p>
<p>I believe the desire for socialism is a coping mechanism for people who have come to the realization that they are neither smart or motivated enough to succeed in a free market economy. Naturally, instead of trying to improve themselves even nominally, they see the notion of pulling everyone else down to their level as being the easiest way to live with their ineptitude.  </p>
<p>They want to eradicate small business because they are a constant reminder of who is succeeding at the community level. Everybody knows someone who runs a successful small business, whether it be a restaurant, shop, gym etc.. On the other hand, there is far less interaction with the people who own or run large corporations. Large corporations are infinitely more ambiguous as far as being representations of individual success.  </p>
<p>This is also why gyms were amongst the first things to be locked down. The losers of society can't cope with people being motivated enough to exercise and improve their strength and physical appearance. They want everyone else to be weak and frail like themselves. Again, due to their own inability to see past their own failures and work towards real individual improvement.  </p>
<p>The solution as they see it is to limit personal freedom to such a degree that it prevents people from doing all the things they themselves are incapable of doing. Working out, starting businesses, taking risks and reaping the rewards.  </p>
<p>I disagree with the Sheep Theory. The people you see wearing masks outside on the street are the exact same people who want this all to keep going. They aren't simply asleep, they are those who actively seek to destroy everyone else's achievements.   </p>
<p>Next we are going to see throttling of the economy and removal of personal liberty in the name of climate change. The soy boys already know they can get away with it; they are already planning their next moves.</p></p>

        <p>Nice theory but I would say the real drivers behind this are the folk who go to the WEF type events, who would be those who had often been successful in a market economy. The super rich now have decided its not enough what they have they want everything else. You'll own nothing and rent it all from them.</p>

        <p>It's not helpful to use this cliche of 'soyboy', or indeed to suggest that socialism is intrinsically linked with not eating meat, because they are completely unrelated.</p>
<p>I don't eat meat. I ate meat until a few years ago. I wasn't a better person before I ate meat, and I'm not a better person now. I just love my dog and felt it was deeply hypocritical to eat other mammals and tacitly support their abuse, when I would be devastated if anyone mistreated her.</p>
<p>Using phrases like 'soyboy' is needlessly divisive, and adds absolutely nothing to your argument. Claiming that you're better than someone else because you eat meat is not a particularly good way of winning over hearts and minds. Equally, it does not follow that you're less of a free thinker if you don't eat meat; in fact, this makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>I don't want to single you out, as many other people on here have been guilty of similar things, even though I broadly agree with their views. Other people that disagree with you are not the enemy. The enemy is the cabal of elitists that are running this whole operation. </p>
<p>The average man and woman in the street are almost completely irrelevant to the socio-economic direction of society, unless they unite.</p>

        <p>Well, that's a bit of a social Darwinist take. Except that all the supposed "losers" are being led by people, who, by capitalist logic, are extremely successful. Support of totalitarianism is not something invented in 2020 either, and it can excuse itself not only by the hatred of the "haves", "kulaks" and "speculants", but also of the "parasites" and "useless people".</p>

        <p>Agreed it was a trial run. And boy, almost a home-run success I’d say. But they’ve got more than a handful of pesky resisters. There are two classes here. The regular, pliable folks and the folks pulling the strings. The pliable folks are indeed sheep - they simply want what they’ve been trained to want (or not want). They beg for it. Sure they like the freebies and handouts. Those who seek to destroy the success of others - part of the training. The demoralization, the fear - also part of the training. The throttling of the economy, removal of liberty, etc. under the guise of climate change - that is the game of the orchestrators.</p>

        <p>"16. Words like “self-confidence,” “self-reliance,” “initiative,” “enterprise,” “optimism,” etc., play little role in the liberal and leftist vocabulary. </p>
<p>The leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. He wants society to solve everyone’s problems for them, satisfy everyone’s needs for them, take care of them. </p>
<p>He is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. </p>
<p>The leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feels like a loser."</p>

        <p>In my personal interactions it is always women and un-masculine men that I see wearing two masks, asking people to pull their mask up, talking about how much they love working from home, how they've been vaccinated already, yadayadayada, bassically going with whatever they're told. Some others are saying we need to have unity, well you can't have unity with people like that  They DO NOT respect our differences and they want to force everyone to be like them. Rather than relocate to a socialist country and be happy they want to make America socialist and too bad if the rest of us don't like it. That's called progressive socialism.</p>

        <p>The politicians know how to cultivate the crab mentality.  They've renamed higher taxes and regulations to socialism, if they could rename it to blueberry pie they would.   Millennials mostly are too naive to understand that government is just a big pot of money that the politicians and lawyers steal from, whatever they can't get their hands on gets wasted on do nothing bureaucrat salaries.   They are too jealous of successful capitalists to be able to see that the money of our economy is better off in the hands of people who create the most value.   They have been mislead into the fallacy that someone else paying more means that they pay less, even though this has never happened in the history of taxation.</p>
