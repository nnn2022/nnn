    <strong>Führer und Reichskanzler Angela Merkel: "We have the possibility of curfews, further contact restrictions, further mask-wearing,"</strong>

<p>&rt;<strong>"Unfortunately, it is not being adhered to everywhere,"</strong> she said. <strong>"There are several states that are interpreting it very broadly, and that doesn’t fill me with joy."</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"What depresses and vexes me is that the good parts of a resolution are implemented...but the difficult part isn’t, as I would wish it to be," Merkel said.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; Specifically, Merkel slammed Armin Laschet, the prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, who was elected leader of her CDU party in January. Laschet has said the emergency brake will be applied only in certain areas where COVID is most prevalent, not the entire state. Merkel said Laschet was violating the principle of the emergency break, but that "he's not the only one." These lax enforcement measured <strong>caused the response to be "a bit delayed, and that cost us a lot of time and a lot of energy, and now with the third wave it looks like the same thing might be happening again."</strong> <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; One state that has vowed to reopen after Easter is the small region of Saarland in western Germany. Merkel acknowledged its infection numbers were relatively low "but they’re not stable...they’re not sinking."</p></p>
