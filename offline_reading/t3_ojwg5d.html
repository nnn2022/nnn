<title>I had a nightmare where I finally had to take the injection. It was my 5th booster and I was terrified because I wondered if this was going to be the "hot-shot” - the one that would debilitate or end me? Or if I would survive this round of Russian Injection Roulette until the next booster?</title>

        <p>I actually had a nightmare my wife took the shot without even telling me. I just entered a random room and there she was smiling at the nurse while the needle was going in her. I was so angry at her getting it, but it was just a dream. That’s all it was. Just a stupid dream.</p>

        <p>Yeah I don't think my dream was a premonition rather a manifestation of my fears (like yours sounds like). But it was realistic in the sense that even if I got one shot - I would absolutely wonder whether or not I had just set off a timer that was counting down until a really bad reaction happened or worse.</p>

        <p>Well it is a roll of the dice pretty much. To see if anything will happen to u short term or long term or nothing at all. These elite scientist dont even know. That’s why they’re testing it on the population. Yet the people are foolish enough to just go ahead with it without giving it a second thought or actually waiting for all the results and maybe wait until they get an actual real vaccine with very low risk to it.</p>

        <p>I've had to get quite a few vaccinations in adulthood for tetanus and such but I have no concerns about the ones with long-term safety data using traditional technology. But one quick visit to r/covidvaccinated will turn anyone into a skeptic real quick.</p>

        <p>Yeah but they plan for everything to happen even the adverse affects and how people would try to post the reactions and deaths on social media. So that’s why there major censorship of the not so safe vaccines. Its all in the SPARS document.</p>

        <p>It is? I heard about the whole 5 years down the line when people are dying of brain injuries they say "whoops, we didn't know any better" but I didn't realize they had that part in it too. I need to read this thing.</p>

        <p>Yeah its basically a step by step guide on how things will develop and what types of things will happen during the “planned pandemic”. The one main difference is that the virus in that document is actually more likely to kill kids than adults. So i guess they didnt get their way with that. These guys are are also really smart as well. They forsaw people getting in outrage for man made viruses and vaccine injury. That’s why they put their political and scientist grunts like cuomo, newsom and fauci out in the front lines to have us attack them instead of actually going for the real string pullers like the think tanks, NGO’s etc. it’s just a war game for these guys, but they’re playing with public population.</p>

        <p>I had a seemingly random nightmare that my friend gave me the vaccine.</p>
<p>Guess what happened the first time I saw him in over a year… he pressured me more than anyone else I know to set up an appointment, and wouldn’t let it go even after I said I didn’t want to.</p>
