        <p>No one wants lockdowns. No one. That's why the US hasn't had a lockdown at any point. No one wants restrictions or masks either. </p>
<p>They even invented a way to avoid them but a lot of people want take them even though they're completely free and some places will even pay you. It's almost like a lot of the very people who supposedly hate lockdowns want us to go backwards while the rest of us just want to move forward and get back to normal because they refuse to do anything to help make that happen.</p>

        <p>It's really more like we're just shocked at how stupid the world is behaving for 99% survivable virus that is killing mostly old, and obese people. So we're just like, f u, no we don't want to comply for this stupid stuff.</p>

        <p>I'm shocked that the sky is purple and cows are just flying around eating people's faces. </p>
<p>And if I repeat that enough and in enough places then hopefully more people will start to believe it even though it's clearly untrue. </p>
<p>And then that bunch of people can all get really mad about it, together as if it's a real thing and circlejerk about it on the internet together and feel smarter than everyone else for once.</p>

        <p>Deny facts all you want one here is echoing falsehoods, were just admitting the truth acknowledged by all.</p>
<p>https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/</p>
<p>https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality</p>
<p>Take whatever death rate you want, it's all less then a few percent, add to that over half the cases are asymptomatic and unreported and you'll never get higher then 1%. Add even more from an estimated 30-40% over counting on deaths and it's even lower. Take any group under obese levels and under 65 and the death rate is almost 0%. Those r just facts. Indisputable.</p>

        <p>Death rate is far from the only issue and your "fact" that only old and obese are affected is undermined by deaths, hospitalization and other long term effects. There's also costs. Even surviving can land you a $200k bill. This ain't just some easily survivable thing. </p>

        <p>The lucky thing is that that isn't happening to anyone. But you know what is actually killing people? Covid! Much higher chance of that killing or long term hurting you. </p>
<p>But I hear you. I don't wear seatbelts because, you know, I might get a rash. I saw a meme about a rash so now I'm just kinda afraid of them forever. Not worth the risk. I don't take risks</p>

        <p>Are you actually this ignorant? Do you realize that more adverse vaccine reactions have been posted for covid vaccines then all history of the vaers system combined. Those things are happening to real people, all over the world. You don't get to just pretend it's not real.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html</p>
<p>The CDC admits they are happening! You're being foolish to just ignore the truth right in front of your eyes. No one is lying, people are dying FROM THE VACCINE, getting myocarditis FROM THE VACCINE, getting anaphylaxis FROM THE VACCINE, getting blood clots FROM THE VACCINE.</p>

        <p>VAERS lists every report they receive regardless. They don't verify these. </p>
<p>And still most of what's there is like 143 or 1200 cases out of hundreds of millions of doses administered. Those are statistical anomalies. Some occur in gen pop at <em>higher rates</em> than the vaccine meaning you're more likely to have them happen <em>without</em> the vaccine.</p>
<p>Y'all always rattle off 99% survival rate as if a 1% death rate isn't <em>really fucking horrific</em>. Now you're telling me you're <em>more afraid of something that might have happened to 143 people</em> which isn't even a percentage you can show. It's like a .000000000000000000000001% chance it'll happen and you are more afraid of that percentage than a virus that kills 1% and has terrible outcomes for a much higher percentage.</p>
<p>Get some consistent internal logic or just admit it: you're just afraid because you really don't understand any of this stuff.</p>

        <p>Wow, I'm not sure what's wrong with you other then you're just brainwashed and can't see the truth anymore. </p>
<p>Vaers death reports are over 10,000. Sure it's not verified, but it's still higher then ever. Do you know how many reports were received for the swine flu vaccine when they pulled it? Do you know that three months after vaccine rollout, vaers had more reports then it has collected since it was created, combined. These aren't some small numbers. And even if they were it wouldn't be enough for me. </p>
<p>The vaccine doesn't prevent infection. The vaccine doesn't prevent transmission. The vaccine causes severe illnesses and deaths. The virus natural caught creates antibodies that prevent reinfection. Those antibodies work on the variants, and keep you from transmitting it to others, and lasts for the rest of your life. I think I'm safer and my family is safer just catching covid naturally then being exposed to the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Did you read that article/study? I'm sure you didn't. It's got nothing to do with Covid. It's a study of people who already had ED and they did tissue samples to see if the penile tissue has leftover virus proteins in it. It does. Which is actually IMO more a a reason to not get the shot, because all it's doing it's giving you the worst part of the virus, the spike proteins and telling your body to start creating them. Tests have show that people have spike proteins in their organs long after getting vaccinated.</p>
