    <strong>Anyone else notice a huge correlation between social pariahs and the pro-lockdown crowd?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m basing this on what I’ve seen with coworkers, my social media feeds, and my immediate circle of friends.</p>
<p>We all know about social hierarchy. No, not the 1% vs 99% hierarchy, but the one that you see constructing itself from day 1 of preschool. Who’s cool and who’s not. Spend one day attending random classes on campus, or study a few hours of corporate meetings and you’ll easily be able to pick out who’s popular and who’s not. Who has plans with friends or activities after class/work, and who’s picking up takeout before burrowing themselves in their basement for 12 hours (piss jugs and all).</p>
<p>I’ve noticed an extremely high correlation between people who swear by lockdowns and people who just didn’t have much going for themselves in the first place.</p>
<p>At my place of work, the most pro-lockdown individuals are all at the bottom in terms of performance. Not one of them is in good shape, or make any effort to make themselves presentable. They don’t travel, either due to not having the means or because they hate social interaction. Many wouldn’t go out and socialize for weeks even before there was a lockdown!</p>
<p>The same applies to what I see on social media. The “neckbeard redditor” stereotype definitely applies. People who obsess over largely indoor type activities like gaming, anime, collectibles, taking cat selfies are loving this.</p>
<p>Misery loves company. And they love that now they don’t have to see pictures and videos of all the parties they weren’t invited to.</p>
<p>Could it be that they aren’t actually supporting lockdowns, but rather the environment lockdowns created that helps mask their social deficiencies?</p>
<p>Lockdowns are home field advantage for social pariahs.</p></p>
