        <p>Ok - so </p>
<p>Bottom of page 47</p>
<p>&rt; No dedicated ADME studies with mRNA-1273 were conducted, which is acceptable as generally nonclinical PK studies are not relevant to support the development and licensure of vaccine for infectious diseases. However, distribution studies should be conducted in the case of new formulations or novel excipients used.</p>
<p>Break down of this paragraph.</p>
<p>ADME -  "absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion"</p>
<p>meaning when you put a drug into your body - what happens to it. Where does it go, and how does your body get rid of it.</p>
<p>nRNA-1273 is the name given to the active ingredient in the moderna vaccine.</p>
<p>So this statement claims - they did no studies on mRNA-1273 to investigate where it goes in your body after the injection.</p>

        <p>page 48 they go on to say...</p>
<p>&rt; No dedicated studies on absorption, metabolism, and excretion for mRNA-1273 have been submitted. </p>
<p>so yes - they admit no studies have been done.</p>
<p>Instead they refer to a different study where they injected rats with a different "Vaccine" or rather mRNA therapy - using mRNA-1647. </p>
<p>They explain mRNA-1647 is the mRNA code for a different virus called the Cytomegalovirus or CMV for short.</p>
<p>After injecting the rats with the mRNA-1647, they chopped them up at different times after injection and examined the various organs to see where the CMV mRNA had travelled to.</p>
<p>&rt; Low levels of mRNA could be detected in all examined tissues except the kidney. This included heart, lung, testis and also brain tissues, indicating that the mRNA/LNP platform crossed the blood/brain barrier</p>

        <p>Lol this is absurd...The implications I'm trying raise with this paper, and you debunking me. I mean you're not wrong in what you say, but somehow it's just making this even worse by showing they didn't really even try.</p>

        <p>these are the FIRST EVER mRNA therapies ever given to humans.</p>
<p>And they are injecting the planet, they are telling people they are safe, and that there have been extensive trials.</p>
<p>They are lying.</p>
<p>FACT</p>
<p>The idea with an mRNA therapy - is clever - but its not simple. You imagine you inject the mRNA into your muscle, and the muscle makes the spike protein... </p>
<p>Is it possible - mRNA could be transported around your body and cause other cells to start producing spike proteins too?</p>
<p>Is it possible - this could trigger dangerous immune responses now or in the future?</p>
<p>You are right - it is absurd. </p>
<p>At best its Clown World.</p>
<p>At worst ....</p>

        <p>Every former mRNA study has failed because the extensive and severe side effects. They know that the side effects are going to be dire, but they also know that the human immune system is is quite resilient, therefore it will take time to see the full magnitude of those side effects, and really, all they need to buy is a year and people won't connect the dots, especially when they will keep us immersed in one pandemic after another, so the vaccines always have an alibi. </p>
<p>Based on your implication, which is quite valid, the fact that this vaccine will lead to the infection of cells throughout the body, which otherwise a virus would never see, and will wreak havoc. This will enable them to administer a repertoire of further gene therapies / vaccines to counter those effects...</p>
<p>The implication that people should be most afraid of, but many are blind to it, is the fact they are relentlessly pursuing the ability to program our bodies.</p>
<p>The Elite will live longer and the remaining population will live much shorter lives. </p>
<p>We are amid the worlds largest human experiment so the Elite can discover the figurative fountain of youth.</p>
