    <strong>Anyone have reliable links to research that proves masks don’t work?</strong>
    <p><p>I am constantly getting into arguments with friends, family, and even strangers on why masks don’t work. I wanted to check with you guys and see if anyone had some research that I could use to help back up my argument. </p>
<p>Side note: Thank you everyone for giving me hope that there are still some normal people in this crazy world.</p></p>

        <p>This one is from July 2020 sponsored by the NIH (Fauci’s org, therefore he has always been aware). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7357397/</p>
<p>It’s fairly redundant, seeing as how they already know the size of a virus particle is less than 4 nanomicrons, whereas masks only filter to 5 MICRONS. Otherwise of course you’d suffocate. They went through the motions anyway, seeing as how they were pretty sure nobody would actually look at studies when talking heads are the basis for 99% of information.</p>

<p><strong>Review of the Medical Literature</strong></p>
<p>Here are key anchor points to the extensive scientific literature that establishes that wearing surgical masks and respirators (e.g., "N95") does not reduce the risk of contracting a verified illness:</p>
<p><strong>Jacobs, J. L. et al. (2009)</strong> "Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the <a href="https://www.greenmedinfo.com/disease/common-cold"><strong>common cold</strong></a> among health care workers in Japan: A randomized controlled trial", <em>American Journal of Infection Control</em>, Volume 37, Issue 5, 417 - 419. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216002"><strong>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216002</strong></a></p>
<p>N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.</p>
<p><strong>Cowling, B. et al.</strong> (2010) "Face masks to prevent transmission of influenza virus: A systematic review", <em>Epidemiology and Infection</em>, 138(4), 449-456. doi:10.1017/S0950268809991658 <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/face%20e-masks-to-prevent-transmission-of-influenza-virus-a-systematicreview/64D368496EBDE0AFCC6639CCC9D8BC05"><strong>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/face e-masks-to-prevent-transmission-of-influenza-virus-a-systematicreview/64D368496EBDE0AFCC6639CCC9D8BC05</strong></a></p>
<p>None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H). See summary Tables 1 and 2 therein.</p>
<p><strong>bin-Reza et al.</strong> <strong>(2012)</strong> "The use of masks and respirators to prevent transmission of influenza: a systematic review of the scientific evidence", <em>Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses</em> 6(4), 257-267. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x"><strong>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x</strong></a></p>
<p>"There were 17 eligible studies. … None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask ⁄ respirator use and protection against influenza infection."</p>
<p><strong>Smith, J.D. et al. (2016)</strong> "Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting health care workers from acute <a href="https://www.greenmedinfo.com/disease/respiratory-infections"><strong>respiratory infection</strong></a>: a systematic review and meta-analysis", <em>CMAJ</em> Mar 2016, cmaj.150835; DOI: 10.1503/cmaj.150835 <a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/8/567"><strong>https://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/8/567</strong></a></p>
<p>"We identified 6 clinical studies ... In the meta-analysis of the clinical studies, we found no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in associated risk of (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (b) influenza-like illness, or (c) reported work-place absenteeism."</p>
<p><strong>Offeddu, V. et al. (2017)</strong> "Effectiveness of Masks and Respirators Against Respiratory Infections in Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis", <em>Clinical Infectious Diseases</em>, Volume 65, Issue 11, 1 December 2017, Pages 1934-1942, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix681 <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747"><strong>https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747</strong></a></p>
<p>"Self-reported assessment of clinical outcomes was prone to bias. Evidence of a protective effect of masks or respirators against verified respiratory infection (VRI) was not statistically significant"; </p>
<p><strong>Radonovich, L.J. et al.</strong> <strong>(2019)</strong> "N95 Respirators vs Medical Masks for Preventing Influenza Among Health Care Personnel: A Randomized Clinical Trial", <em>JAMA</em>. 2019; 322(9): 824-833. doi:10.1001/jama.2019.11645 <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2749214"><strong>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2749214</strong></a></p>
<p>"Among 2862 randomized participants, 2371 completed the study and accounted for 5180 HCW-seasons. … Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks as worn by participants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza."</p>
<p><strong>Long, Y. et al.</strong> <strong>(2020)</strong> "Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza: A systematic review and meta‐analysis", <em>J Evid Based Med.</em> 2020; 1‐ 9. https://doi.org/10.1111/jebm.12381 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jebm.12381"><strong>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jebm.12381</strong></a></p>
<p>"A total of six RCTs involving 9 171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory‐confirmed influenza, laboratory‐confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory‐confirmed respiratory infection and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta‐analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory‐confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43‐0.78). The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory‐confirmed influenza."</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion Regarding that Masks Do Not Work</strong></p>
<p>No RCT study with verified outcome shows a benefit for HCW or community members in households to wearing a mask or respirator. There is no such study. There are no exceptions.</p>
<p>Likewise, no study exists that shows a benefit from a broad policy to wear masks in public (more on this below).</p>
<p>Furthermore, if there were any benefit to wearing a mask, because of the blocking power against droplets and aerosol particles, then there should be more benefit from wearing a respirator (N95) compared to a surgical mask, yet several large meta-analyses, and all the RCT, prove that there is no such relative benefit.</p>
<p>Masks and respirators do not work.</p>

        <p>The evidence is that they do work, with an understood mechanism.</p>
<p>Purpose of face-covering is to slow the spread in a population, not to provide a 100% effective personal protection. This is why it is important that those around you wear a face covering, this is how you are protected.  </p>
<p>Their many academic studies covering the topic, the general consensus is they work, but have to be part of broader 'do it all' approach. Regular hand washing, avoid crowed area etc.</p>
<p>If you are having difficultly finding evidence to support your view, you should perhaps change your view. </p>
<p>I know this isn't what you're asking for, but I hope this was helpful.</p>

        <p>This is all theoretically correct, but in practice '100% effective personal protection' is what masks are being touted as, and what people (incorrectly) treat them as.</p>

        <p>I don't know where your gaps in understanding are but you shouldn't say something is 0% or 100% effective unless you have observed every instance.  For example, I can't say decapitation will 100% kill a person, maybe 10,000 years in the future when we're living on Mars the first thing that happens to newborns is they are decapitated and have their heads put into robot bodies.  Since I haven't observed 100% of decapitations I cannot say that decapitations will 100% kill a person.</p>
<p>Point is, no one (but you and this sub) ever believed masks were 100% protection.</p>
<p>Now myself, an intellectual, believe masks to be between 2% and 10% effective, other NPIs being also adhered to.</p>
<p>But that's the thing...</p>
<p>Let's take brakes on a car (analogies are great to simplify concepts), they don't stop the car, they reduce the speed of the car until the car's speed is 0 mph.</p>
<p>It's the same thing with masks. They don't stop the spread of COVID-19, they reduce the rate of spread of COVID-19 until the rate of spread of COVID-19 is 0.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

        <p>I know it's to reduce the rate of spread. That's why I called it 'correct' when the poster above said so. But your Doctor Strange approach to logic is brilliant; we'd need fourteen million futures to find one where 'zero Covid' works!</p>

        <p>I haven't came across that myself. The messages I have received from my government was "help slow the spread" which is fair and correct statement to make. </p>
<p>But I would add there isn't a hard hat, steel toe capped show or any other PPE that is 100% effective. </p>
<p>I think all that is required from the public is to know, that face covering are effective in reducing the spread of the virus. </p>
<p>unfortunately though, they require other people to wear one to offer you protection. This can be "my liberty ends where yours begins" debate. My view is if you choose to be around other people you have a 'duty of care' not to inadvertently infecte them. Wearing a face covering is a practical precaution that reduces the risk.</p>

        <p>“If you are having difficulty finding evidence to support your view, you should perhaps change your view. I know this is t what you’re asking for, but I hope this was helpful” that’s what left of your post once you remove party propaganda. I’d ask you for cited sources to back your claims  but you’ll come back with 30 Google searches backing you up. Google is not research. It’s not even a search engine. It’s an aggregator. Stop parroting party lines and if you’re still capable do some independent critical thinking.</p>

        <p>Great! We are in agreement on two points.</p>
<p>1) That there is research pointing to the effectiveness of face masks (you said it yourself, google will return with results) </p>
<p>2)That using a search engine shouldn't be considered research. As I am sure you would agree, this can lead to conspiracy theories being created and propagated without being challenged.</p>
<p>There many studies/papers pointing to the effectiveness of masks, very few saying otherwise. </p>
<p>Do you have anything of substance to offer? any evidence or facts. Other than attack what you perceive is my motives.</p>
<p>Repeating what I said before: If you are having difficulty finding evidence to support your view, you should perhaps change your view. </p>
<p>I will wait for your responses.</p>
