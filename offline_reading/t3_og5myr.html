        <p>I had a blood clot in my left leg that passed into my lungs. I was bedridden in a hospital for 3 months and I had to learn how to walk again. I cannot imagine the pain this poor girl felt before she died. My leg felt like it was going to explode. 
These monsters need to pay for this.</p>

        <p>Fort Detrick Maryland possibly where it all started in July 2019. 
 To cover it up, it may have been spread in Wuhan China during the World Military Games in October... Event 201 was the same date, October 18, as the WMGs.  </p>
<p>Lots of athletes got sick with a mystery respiratory illness after attending.  Fort Detrick got shut down in August 2019 for safety concerns.  Lots of nursing homes around the Maryland area suffered from respirtatory outbreaks killing many residents. </p>
<p>This whole thing goes extremely deep, no one really knows who is to blame.  This all could be straight up CCP propaganda, but there are a number of news articles that are on American media pages well before the pandemic ever started detailing a mystery respiratory illlness killing many, maybe it was COVID?</p>

<p>Did you not notice the clot for a long time?  I was told that there is a significant pain in the area and it feels hot.</p>

        <p>The first thing I noticed was terrible pain in my leg in the middle of the night. I didn't think much of it since I was barely awake. I popped a couple vicodin and went back to sleep. When I got up a few hours later my left leg was easily twice the size of my right and I knew that was bad news. Rushed to the ER and the rest is in the update I just posted.<br>
Truthfully I shouldn't be here today. I don't know how many bullets I dodged making it through that ordeal but I fully believe at least a small miracle took place.</p>

        <p>I posted that real quick when I had a moment but to elaborate this happened in 2002. I have a genetic disorder called Familial Adenamatous Polyposis (have run reading about that) and  I had a desmoid tumor that was growing rapidly and was not stopping. It pressed on an artery in my left leg causing a DVT/PE. Blood clot that then passes into your lungs. </p>
<p>So I spent 3 months in a hospital and about a little over 2 months in a bed. It got to the point where they had to give me 80mg (yes EIGHT ZERO) of Morphine over the course of an hour to allow me to be able to breath as the tumor started pressing on my lungs. <br>
Now I don't remember the time frame at this point but it wasn't more than a few days when all of a sudden the tumor spontaneously melted. Keep in mind I had not received any treatments for 4+ months at that point. Any how they wheeled me down to the OR and drained 2 liters of necrotic tumor tissue out of my abdomen which let me breathe again. <br>
I was out of the hospital about a month after that after learning how to walk again. That took 2 weeks and it was friggin hard heh. </p>
<p>Things are going great now. I went home in August of 2002 and on Feb 2003 I met my now wife and we have a 6 yo son together. It was a long ass road to get here but I'm still trucking.  :)</p>

        <p>“The girl allegedly suffered from chronic platelet deficiency, a “familial autoimmune thrombocytopenia”. This is what investigators have learned from the first reports of the doctors.</p>
<p>But the girl’s family, assisted by the lawyer Angelo Paone, is firm on this point. “Camilla had no disease,” explained their lawyer. Supporting their claim, are two different CT scans. She had undergone the two scans, and was discharged after the first one that had not shown the situation of the thrombosis in progress, but immediately transferred to the hospital after the second showing that her health had been compromised.” </p>
<p>OFC they’re trying to act like it’s not connected. This is damning. I hope this girl’s family gets all the justice they deserve.</p>

        <p>It’s not normal, but some want it to be the new normal. Imagine a future where specific people are involuntarily lined up to be “vaccinated” (with what are not vaccines) in door-to-door “vaccine initiatives” against “new variants” (which, soon enough, may not be new). Then, when they inevitably die to whatever cocktail went into them, the CoD on the death certificate is the “new variant”. That, combined with recent growing resentment against “extremism” and “misinformation”, makes for a troubling alignment of circumstances where “vaccine hesitancy” is used to select and exterminate wrongthink in a medical tyranny. I’m not much of a conspiracy theorist, but all this (door-to-door vaccination, anti-“extremism”, variant fearmongering) has come out of the Biden administration recently. I’ve only just put two and two together, and honestly, I don’t want to believe it. It’s too horrible, too unthinkable, even for what government has shown itself capable of both historically and recently. Please convince me otherwise.</p>

        <p>Same. Never been into conspiracy theories, ever! But, these theories of people conspiring are legitimate concerns! There are too many red flags to ignore. If shit doesn’t add up, it doesn’t add up. Call it what you want but it feels like a government takeover. I am fearful of what happens next; that is not freedom.</p>

        <p>You call yourself not much of a conspiracy theorist yet you've come to the same kind of conclusion we have with just a little bit of thinking about it. Good. Really the only difference now from someone that's been in this for the past decade is, do they conspire to kill us with intricate plans of a shadow society or is this all just a series of fatal mistakes? And the truth I choose to believe is yeah they conspire to kill us, but not just kill us, get us to make the choice ourselves.</p>

        <p>My personal beliefs toward conspiracy take some cues from market economics. Chains of production in a modern market economy are long, complicated, and arcane. Thing is, though, individual actors within those production chains have relatively little knowledge, and make relatively few decisions, about the process as a whole. See <a href="https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/I,_Pencil">I, Pencil</a> for a literary explanation of what I mean. I think, most of the time, this same sort of compartmentalized, self-interested decision-making is all that is <em>necessary</em> (read that again) to explain even this sort of widespread, sinister phenomenon. Is a shadow government a <em>possible</em>, or even <em>likely</em> explanation? Sure, but the simplest explanation is always the best until more evidence is available. (Fauci’s emails would be an example of “more evidence” - deliberately lying for months to huge numbers of people about your professional opinion for no clear reason, while it destroys the lives of those very same people?) I just prefer to err on the side of “united in purpose, but not in plan” as long as evidence permits.</p>

        <p>The verbiage is actually pretty standard to how dangerous pathogens have been handled in the past. If you are infected with a deadly virus with a high morbidity and mortality rate than the government in the past has put people like that in quarantine. That's not controversial at all. What is controversial, goes against any previous plans to contain an epidemic, and has now been proven to be largely a failure is locking down entire populations whether they are sick or not. That is not what is being said in this bill. It also looks like the verbiage in you source does not match the actual bill and the bill is more explicit in the intent.</p>

        <p>I remember listening to a podcast a couple years back and this guy said that the mark of the beast will be a vaccine, that will change your DNA in a manner that you'll no longer be technically human, and maybe is not this one but this seems like the begging of testing until they get the right one, there is too many coincidences and I'm starting to believe it</p>

        <p>Just heard a lady talking about how her son has MS, and he doesn't want the vaccine because he's worried about the side effects. She's super upset that he's not getting it and said he's going to die of the "delta variant." What an awful mother. He's already scared from having MS, and now his mom is telling him that he's gunna die?! Wtf.</p>

        <p>All venous sinuses were blocked with thrombi, a scenario I have never seen in my many years in this profession. Think of the venous sinus as the river in the middle of a valley where several streams converge. If a dam is built in the middle of the watercourse, the river swells and the tributaries can no longer drain at this point, so that the pressure rises upstream.</p>

        <p>When COVID-21 or whatever they call it rolls around…guess what? New round of vaccines.</p>
<p>I honestly believe there is no virus, and the first cases of people dying began after the first round of vaccine trials. They faked the science and created a society that will now live in fear of something that doesn’t exist. At least not the way they report it. Is there a flu going around? Yes.</p>
<p>COVID-19 was created (propaganda) to vaccinate the world with spike proteins. The vaccine wasn’t created because of the pandemic. The pandemic was created because of the vaccine.</p>
<p>What does the vaccine do exactly? I think it’s a sort of price of entry into the new normal society, where the weak will be killed (about 5%) for the good of society. It’s depopulation, but they only care about the people who survive.</p>
<p>As the “virus” propaganda mutates, they will have vaccines for targeted groups such as the very young and elderly. There’s a possibility the vaccines make people sterile, so that might explain why they haven’t vaccinated the young yet.</p>
