    <strong>I don't care if correlation doesn't equal causation, it's still relevant</strong>
    <p><p>Liberals don't understand the concept of a generalization. We're not talking about every single person in whatever demographic. Noticing trends is not bigoted and no I don't care if you're an exception to the rule, you didn't debunk anything as nobody is arguing all. I also hate how stupid people will get pissy if you don't specify "not all" or even if you do they'll act like you didn't. It doesn't prove anything. Generalizations are useful. See how far you get in life by trusting everyone you come in contact with. We have instincts and intuition, we notice patterns. Try playing a game. Look up a bunch of celebrities and try and guess where they stand on politics or religion. I gurantee you'll get it right for the most part. The people that are harder to guess will be closer to the middle. There's this kid I used to work with and in the first 5 minutes I was able to deduce that he was an atheist and he wasn't a stereotype at all. Sure enough in the first hour of working with him he brings up that he's an atheist. This kind of thing happens fairly often.</p></p>

<p>"Cases and deaths have gone up in Israel since they began mass vaccinations."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but causation is not correlation."</p>
<p>Okay.  </p>
<p>But then they say the exact reverse.</p>
<p>"Look at the numbers in Israel now!  They are going down now.  Vaccination seems to be working!  Yay!"</p>

        <p>This argument of correlation and causation only really applies when you are debating scientific fact. In every day life, correlations do carry some weight, but only because we don’t have strong scientific data. We have to argue from inference and probability. </p>
<p>Take a rise in suicide and lockdowns for instance. I can argue all day that lockdowns are going to increase the number of suicides, but proving strict causation isn’t really possible. You just can’t set up a proper experiment to test this hypothesis (for a number of reasons). But we do have strong corroborative evidence to back up this claim. </p>
<p>Most knowledge is based on inference and inductive reasoning, not irrefutable scientific fact. People use this tactic to control the narrative. You are way more likely to believe in something you’ve been preconditioned to believe.</p>

        <p>Yeah like it’s human nature to pass judgement .. it’s not a bad thing unless you let it affect how you treat people .. idk just my take on it. Like why do stereotypes exist? I mean they typically do carry some truth to them.</p>
