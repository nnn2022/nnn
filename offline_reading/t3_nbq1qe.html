    <strong>Canadians, prepare for the Mask to slip any day Now</strong>
    <p><p>When Trudeau goes on mainstream news to float an idea, it usually passes in a month or less. Vaccine passports are already being rationalized in Quebec.  What we've known since the beginning of the Scamdemic, that the government will force digital ID and unperson holdouts, is about to become a reality very soon. </p>
<p>Most realize this. But even now I see so many fools cling to the belief they will be given the option of refusal, or that this simply isn't happening. Trudeau can never allow a substantial minority of the population to refuse vaccination if Digital ID is to work, it would create a loophole circumventing the entire system which is about totalitarian control.  The very ideology of "zero covid" the government sponsors requires 100% "vaccination" levels, and the regime has been making it clear from the very beginning that resistors cannot be allowed to coexist.</p>
<p>And this is critical. Trudeau is trying to impose a globalist dictatorship and has been lying about it since the very beginning. Now that the mask is slipping, the true nature of the Canadian dictatorship has to emerge. Which is the government must begin instituting totalitarianism.  Yes, there will either be mass incarceration, door to door vaccination drives that cannot be refused, or "isolation" concentration camps. Now that the regime is openly trying to dehumanize and destroy the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands across this country, it cannot simply let resistors remain at large and threats to the government. You will not be given the option of refusal by the government for long.</p>
<p>People keep saying "this can't be happening", "this has to be accidental", "we have the charter". All of this nonsense. Do not think for a second that voting matters in Canada anymore. The Regime is already preparing for mail-in ballots identical to what happened in the united states, and we've seen it been done in Newfoundland with extreme irregularities resulting in a globalist occupied government. It will be exactly the same writ large, only with large portions of the internet censored.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the all important question no-one seems to address: What do you do?</p>
<p>Smart money fled months ago. Anyone with money still can. But for the average person, the most important thing you can do is <strong>sever all electronic communications used to track dissidents by the regime and become anonymous</strong>. Kill your social media. Unplug from the many fake honeypots being set up by the government to corral and control you. Stop using digital purchasing. Stop carrying your cell phone everywhere. Stop telegraphing your intentions if you're in occupied territory as most of Canada is. Stop telegraphing your intentions digitally. Carry cash and ample food on hand</p>
<p>And this brings me to an important point, which is that the "protests" in Canada are largely controlled opposition ran by the government and overwhelmingly staffed by paid astroturf. I have seen evidence that in many of these, beneath the veneer, government agents are actually using them as radicalization honeypots to keep tabs on anyone aware of what is happening. If the government wanted to fabricate terrorism busts to justify the war measures act, it would use these honeypots along with pervasive military and police spying on everyone involved as the rationale.</p>
<p>The most important piece of advice I can give is <strong>never network with randoms you meet through social media or protesting</strong>. If you participate in protesting, never join these groups or even give truthful information about yourself. <strong>It is very important that real dissidents stay anonymous at these events because they are being used to identify threats</strong></p>
<p>Government spies read everything I post and know exactly who I am. I was trapped very early for foolishly participating in these fronts as if they represented real political organizations. Do not make the same mistake, do not become a number in the expanding security apparatus that will soon constitute the dictatorship of Canada</p>
<p><strong>The mere fact of interacting with someone like me, with posts like this, could be enough to be put under surveillance. If you have questions PM me, don't respond</strong></p></p>

        <p>My guy. We can't magically patrol the largest unguarded border on the planet with our lack of military numbers. Never going to happen.</p>
