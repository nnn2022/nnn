        <p>the vaccine has likely killed over 100,000 in the us alone, if you look at cdc data.. they are largely calling it "natural causes"</p>
<p>it's interesting how the average age of covid deaths didn't go lower than the national overall average..</p>
<p>but "natural causes" age of death is dropping rapidly since a policy dictated that anyone who got the vaccine should be counted as natural causes as long as they survive 15 minutes..</p>
<p>the vaccine is killing far more (edit: percentagewise but close to total over time also already) and far younger than covid ever has</p>

        <p>Can you relay some of this data ? Just straight up links we’ll sort the numbers. I have many people who are on the fence about the vaccine, and we’re all very young, in our 20s.</p>

<p>you think we the only people out here posting and having people ask for sources on them digits? We all gotta have our ammunition at the ready boss. </p>
<p>Try my boy Mr. Bond. Bond4141</p>
<p>Edit: Covid-1984: Requiem for a Scam</p>
<p>Here’s how this multilayered racket works.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create Faulty “Covid” PCR Test</li>
</ol>
<p>”without having virus material available” 1</p>
<p>“relying instead on the Chinese scientists’ genetic sequence published on the internet” 2</p>
<ol>
<li>Asymptomatic, Anyone?</li>
</ol>
<p>Only use 2 out of 3 test primers and greater than 35 cycles:</p>
<p>“...the probability that said result is a false positive is 97%” 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 31, 32, 39, 40, 44, 45</p>
<p>”It is spreading like fire,” Abbi told NBC News by phone... none of them had really serious symptoms. In fact, they all seem to be asymptomatic.” 27</p>
<p>BBC: “Majority testing positive have no symptoms” 28, 29, 30, 31</p>
<p>”NFL has 77 apparently false positive coronavirus tests from New Jersey lab” 41</p>
<ol>
<li>Cash for COVID Diagnosis</li>
</ol>
<p>”They get more money if those patients are then put on ventilators.” 3, 4, 5</p>
<p>”Once again the old adage — follow the money — and we saw that if hospitals could somehow hit 161 admissions with COVID-19, that they would be eligible for a $77,000 per admission payment through the CARES Act.” 49</p>
<p>He added, “I don’t think there’s any questions that perverse incentives have been created.” -Sen. Scott Jensen</p>
<ol>
<li>Use antibody and antigen tests prone to “cross-reactivity” with other coronaviruses...</li>
</ol>
<p>Creating false positives and negatives. 15, 16, 17,  18, 47</p>
<p>”...all 10 of the individuals who tested positive with the antigen tests on Saturday tested negative today.” 46</p>
<ol>
<li>Cook the Books</li>
</ol>
<p>”...classifying all deaths of patients with coronavirus as 'COVID-19' deaths, regardless of cause.” 19, 20, 21, 36, 37, 38</p>
<p>Count Death by:</p>
<p>•   ⁠Motorcycle accident 22
•   ⁠Car accident 23
•   ⁠Ladder falls 24
•   ⁠Suicides and murders 25</p>
<p>Gunshots?</p>
<p>”These two people had tested positive for COVID, but that’s not what killed them. The gunshot wound killed them and it’s very misleading for you to put numbers out there saying these people died from COVID when that’s not what they died from,” said Coroner Brenda Bock.” 43</p>
<p>”Tennessee woman who died in February gets letter saying she’s positive for COVID-19” 26</p>
<p>If caught cooking the books, remove those items and say it was a goof.</p>
<p>Dr. Genevieve Briand states:</p>
<p>“If [the COVID-19 death toll] was not misleading at all, what we should have observed is an increased number of heart attacks and increased COVID-19 numbers. But a decreased number of heart attacks and all the other death causes doesn’t give us a choice but to point to some misclassification,” Briand replied.” 33 34 35</p>
<p>Note: Johns Hopkins pulled Dr. Genevieve Briand’s study.  Cat’s out of the bag though.</p>

<p>look up CDC year end data from last year</p>

        <p>The question you should be asking is why the CDC is purposely skewing the death count.  The CDC criteria is that the Covid vaccines can ONLY cause death by anaphylaxis.  Here's a comparison to illustrate how shady this is.</p>
<p>The only way you can die from a gunshot wound is by lead toxicity.  If you only count this, then it would look like no one dies from being shot.</p>

        <p>I JUST SAID what to look for jackass. it is evidence, its not rock solid proof, maybe theres some other completely hidden new factor that they are ALSO not talking about that is causing tens to hundreds of thousands of deaths from 'natural causes', but given the timing, the policy changes WHICH ARE ALSO ADMITTED, the motives, the history of this vaccine, and the numbers, its a pretty damn blatantly obvious conclusion that the vaccine is killing shitloads of people</p>
<p>or look up the vaers reports, already in the tens of thousands, which ISN'T CLOSE to comprehensive</p>
<p>if your too stupid to understand basic logic, and too insane and willfully ignorant to EVEN LOOK at the facts, you are the "fucking stupid" one</p>

        <p>Here's some stuff to look at:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm">Excess Deaths</a></p>
<p>Notice how the excess deaths spike in January.  The excess deaths on 1/9/21 are the same as 4/11/21 when there were much fewer Covid cases.  This makes zero sense.  In any pandemic, the most vulnerable people die at that start.  As time goes on there are fewer vulnerable people to contract the disease because they're already dead.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate">U.S. Death Rate</a></p>
<p>The death rate for 2019 and 2020 is practically the same, and a slightly smaller % increase than 2018-2019.</p>
<p>Funny how this info doesn't make the news.</p>

        <p>Look at your second link and tell me what it says in the red box.  Do you understand that the number listed for 2020 is not the actual number of deaths and is just a prediction of what the deaths would have been before Covid happened?  </p>
<p>The CDC is still counting deaths for 2020.  They usually don't have an official count until the end of the next year.  They are reporting a running total, which is currently 3,372,412.  That's about 518,000 more than 2019.</p>

        <p>Yet, with everything that's happened, that's still the prediction.  You realize that provisional counts tend to be higher than the actual, right?  Provisional counts are based on mathematical modeling from a smaller sample, not actual death certificate counts.</p>
<p>We see the same thing with cfr vs ifr.  Cfr is always higher.  Now this time next year, you may have an argument because we'll have more complete info.
Now, they may end up putting a disclaimer on the page, but I have no control over that.</p>
<p>Still, did you look at the first link at all?  Seems like the excess death numbers don't match up with the covid case numbers for all of those to be mainly covid.  But hey, pick the softer target and ignore the others, amirite?</p>

        <p>In the red box in the link, it says that the projections do not take into account any effects of COVID-19.   </p>
<p>The CDC states:  "Provisional death counts are based on death certificate data received and coded by the National Center for Health Certificates." They are provisional because they are not yet a final total.  They are still counting more.  They are always very low for recent weeks because the deaths have not yet been tabulated.<br>
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm</p>
<p>Excess deaths, on the other hand, are based in part on estimates.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what point you are making with the excess deaths by week.  They were highest at the end of December and start of January, and the second highest peak was the week of April 11, 2020.  Those are the times when the most people were dying of Covid, and the most people had Covid.   There weren't as many positive tests in April because not as many people were getting tested, but they were still dying.   Lots of people who did not get Covid in the spring got it in the winter.  And lots of other people, including vulnerable people, have not gotten it at all. It's not at all true that all the vulnerable people died at the beginning of the pandemic, even in places that were hit hard like NYC.  Other places, like Florida, didn't have much spread of the virus yet in the spring, but their cases and deaths peaked in summer and winter.</p>

        <p>Look at the number of cases on those two days and tell me what you see.  We had tests for Covid in April.  Thise tests were used for people in the hospital mainly because they were the most sick.  Look at the cases in relation to deaths.  Then deaths related to cases in January. From both Covid and all cause.  The pattern in the numbers doesn't match what the cdc and panic media have been reporting in the mainstream.</p>
<p>You want to make a big deal about lack of testing early on, but that would mean the CDC was counting deaths as Covid without any actual evidence! <em>gasp</em>
Kidding, we know the CDC has been inflating the death counts this whole time.</p>
<p>And yes the CDC does use death certificates reported, but they also estimate what the total deaths will be using a mathematical model until they finalize the count.</p>
<p>If you refuse to see the truth, then I can't make you.  Unfortunately you can't really save the lemmings.  They fight you tooth and claw to throw themselves from the cliff.  I would say you'd be happier at the Novel Coronavirus sub, but they're finally deciding to wise up.</p>
<p>Anyway, goodluck.</p>

        <p>Someone is denying reality in the face of a 19% increase in deaths over the whole year and a 39% increase in December.  If you refuse to acknowledge the truth, I can't make you, but I am going to make sure that people see the truth anyway. The 3.372 million is the current count.  Not an estimate.  The number keeps going up as more data is received and coded. It was 2.9 million back in December, and that information was presented back then by people trying to minimize Covid.</p>

        <p>Funny you should say I'm ignoring the truth when you refuse to look at any evidence that challenges your preconceived notions.  Never said that more deaths were impossible.  They're just not from Covid directly.  They're from the eating take out, sedentary, stay at home lifestyle.  And people being too afraid to seek medical attention for their conditons because they're afraid of a disease that's over 99% survivable.  It's our government's response and our own willingness to be sheep that caused these deaths.  I wish YOU could see the truth.</p>
<p>This is my fault.  I mistakenly thought you might actually want to learn, and maybe you just hadn't been able to find info.  I've referenced dozens of studies and articles, all from reliable sources, to people like you before.  And like all the rest, I bet you'd nitpick and focus on one isolated datum that supports you while ignoring everything else.  Then, spout how my own source doesn't support my argument.</p>
<p>I've shared with others who actually read the whole thing and come to their own conclusions.  I see you just blindly believe what an athority tells you is the interpretation, regardless of what the evidence really says. /smh</p>
<p>Your majority is slimming though.  So, enjoy it while it lasts.  I implore you to search out sources that disagree with you.  Your blind fanaticism toward this false narrative won't help you.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what you mean about my majority slimming.  People are getting vaccinated at very high rates in my state.  Most people realize that the goal is to get the number of serious cases down to a point where the risk balance has changed, and that we must resume our normal lives.  The people that, for example, want to keep the schools or outdoor rec facilities closed  are in the minority now, thankfully.  But that doesn't mean people are changing their minds about Covid itself, just the current risk balance.  And I am still seeing a few people changing their minds in the other direction when they learn of a hospitalization or death of someone they knew who was not elderly and not immune compromised.</p>

        <p>And I'm seeing more than a few realizing that these Covid deaths aren't actually due to Covid.  You have someone who's 5 foot even and weighs in excess of 200 lbs, with a history of heart and respiratory disease, die of a heart attack, yet it's listed as Covid.  Or a hard-core alcoholic vomits and aspirates, but it's covid becaise they had a positive test.  Even though they had no symptoms.</p>
<p>The majority I'm referring to are the people who continue to blindly believe social media and biased mainstream media.  The people who believe that a non-N95 mask will protect you from Covid, even though there's reliable studies that prove otherwise.  The people who fixate on what an authority says and ignores anything to the contrary.  The people who confuse correlation with causation.</p>
<p>Though, I really think you're saying this stuff knowing it'll get downvotes.  You can delude yourself that you're in the right, and people are suppressing the truth.  I don't handle psych cases.  So, hope you find the help you need.</p>

        <p>I am saying the truth because an echo chamber is dangerous.  Some people tend to follow the crowd that they are exposed to.  I actually don't know anyone who blindly follows everything said by mainstream media, but I do know people who blindly follow and share alternative media, especially anti-vax media.   I'm sure there are some people who have been convinced that a mask is total protection, which encourages them to go out and spend money in stores like the companies want, but most people I know understand that it's just a layer of protection.  </p>
<p>I see Covid deniers desperately trying to convince themselves that Covid doesn't cause the deaths, but the evidence is so overwhelming at this point.  So many doctors and nurses all over the world.  So many families.  And the shocking increase in total deaths in the U.S.  The most recent Covid death that I heard about was someone who thought Covid was overblown and that he was not in a risk category.  His loved ones say now that it affects everyone differently and is unpredictable.</p>

        <p>Always funny when someone says they'd get the vaccine - an experimental injectable you cannot simply suck back out of your body - in the hopes they'll no longer have to wear an easily-removable face covering that does indeed carry risks but to an arguably much lesser degree.</p>

        <p>I'm a vaxxer. It's not a complicated response from us. One person dying from the vaccine is also too many.</p>
<p>But far more people die from the disease than from the vaccine. So, um... yeah... there's a basic math question here that even some of you guys could work out.</p>
<p>You can't use your fingers to help with counting, though. I doubt any of you have more 550k fingers to count up all the victims from covid.</p>

        <p>Prove that masks do so. If that was the outcome, areas employing mask mandates should see a dramatic drop in cases, right? Areas without them, by contrast, should see exploding case rates in comparison.</p>
<p>However, data does not show this to be the case... many areas without strict masking perform better than many areas with, which seem to still massively suffer. So the masks can't be doing much...</p>

        <p>Having been on this sub, do you really believe people have been following the mandates consistently across an entire region? Maybe in countries like south korea and singapore where mask wearing was already a public courtesy and doesn't have negative social stigma. They seem to have recovered far quicker in much more densely populated areas.</p>
<p>Covid is roughly 0.12 microns in diameter while N95 masks are designed to protect up to 0.1 microns. Also, covid usually travels when attached to something like the droplets of your breath, which is bigger than the virus. So yea, masks definitely make a big difference hence the number 95, as in 95% efficiency.</p>

        <p>100% of people definitely don't follow them.</p>
<p>Areas without mask mandates have different "adherence" rates (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1114375/wearing-a-face-mask-outside-in-european-countries/">source</a>).</p>
<p>Let's use UK and Sweden from this data - UK has very heavy lockdowns and Sweden has, for most of the time, had very little. We'll assume "Frequently/Always" combine to equal the mask adherence. Obviously there's a bit of variance between those figures and adherence rate as they say nothing about how frequently each type of person is in public, but we'll use those figures to begin with as they serve well enough.</p>
<p>UK: 78.8% adherence; 1862 deaths/million</p>
<p>Sweden: 23.3% adherence; 1338 deaths/million</p>
<p>The UK has roughly 50% more adherence, and yet is suffering about 50% more than Sweden. I'm not trying to say that masks <em>cause</em> death, but you would think if they were so powerful, you would see the difference. Yet it never materialises. Mask adherence rate and mandates seem completely unrelated to outcome.</p>
<p>N95s may be effective, but most people aren't wearing N95s.</p>

        <p>Ok true, those are striking stats but also doesn't detail the underlying conditions that differentiate the countries (population density, average persons/household). I don't think we"ll be able to find concrete and consistent stats directly related to the efficacy of masks at scale because theres very few countries that have adherence accurately graded.</p>
<p>The opposite could be argued, again, for south korea and singapore.</p>
<p>Those are still interesting stats so i'll look into it.</p>

        <p>Also to be clear, i support everyones right to not wear a mask and not getting the vaccine. But, if the private property youre visiting mandates it (whether you believe they work or not), why cant SOME people realize it's also the business's right to refuse to do business with them?

<p>No, no it did not.  Dying <em>with</em> COVID is very different than dying <em>from</em> COVID.  The two are not the same.</p>

        <p>Not only that but they also put people in that list simply because they died on the same floor as someone who died with covid without any testing in every elderly residences. That boosted the numbers so much ! That's without saying everything they did to clearly accelerate these deaths.</p>
<p>Also,why do they not restart the count of cases/deaths at the beginning of each wave like they do with any other diseases or simply the flu since it follow the exact same curve ? Just to present a bigger number.</p>

        <p>How do you not understand that the coronavirus can exacerbate issues that are already there and cause new ones besides the disease Covid-19? If SARS-Cov2 causes your lungs to fill up with fluid and you die from a lack of oxygen, that would be the coronavirus killing you. How do you not understand this</p>

        <p>I do understand it.  I also understand that there are many documented situations where people died from car accidents, gunshots, etc and yet were still categorized as “covid deaths”.   I also know that New York uses an insane figure of being infected within the last 60 days when counting “covid deaths” which is entirely unreasonable.  </p>
<p>My point isn’t that covid doesn’t exacerbate other health conditions, possibly leading to death.  My point <em>is</em> that the way officials track covid deaths leads to vastly overinflated numbers.  (The “vastly” part is just my opinion, though the rest of the sentence is factual)</p>

        <p>Exactly: COVID can exacerbate other issues. That's how most of them die: they were already sick before COVID. These couple million extra deaths around the world weren't young healthy people with their whole life ahead of them. Nor were they some targeted extermination of the infirm, or an attack that wiped a city off the map. This is an understandably alarming but generally reasonable increase in the death rate of those who were already a bit nearer death than average, perhaps with a smattering of other folks who had no apparent risk factor other than maybe just bad luck.</p>

        <p>60 million people die every year, a milion are born every week or so, there are some things arguably worse than death that aren't tallied up so neatly, we don't have enough information on long-term effects of either COVID or the vaccine to say which is objectively worse, so it should be up to the individual to determine their own risk tolerance and take risks or precautions as they see fit.</p>
