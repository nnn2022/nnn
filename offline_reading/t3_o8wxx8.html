        <p>If I have to tell you, then there's no point in doing so because you're clearly not open to seeing things that conflict with what you have chosen to believe... things like some governors ordering nursing homes take in active cases when the virus was so dangerous that the rest of us had to stay at home while the economy got decimated.</p>
<p>Of course there are personal details as well, like my job gaining very professional decals (bearing the "social distancing" phrase among other things) for floor marking within a two weeks of the phrase being coined and the executive orders being issued.</p>
<p>No, I'm aware that it proves nothing.  My skepticism is rooted in familiarity with manufacturing and the time it takes to configure layouts, printing plates and set up dies to produce something that I'm to believe wasn't sitting on a warehouse shelf somewhere- perhaps adjacent to yellow caution or "No Smoking" tape as a stock item... all as the means of producing and distributing such items was ordered closed- quite abruptly, too.</p>
<p>We could touch upon the suppression of treatments like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin- both which had existed for a good number of years but you're not open to this and likely have a ready answer so why should I bother?  You came here with a disingenuous question intended to ridicule us because we dare doubt the particulars of a campaign run by people who seem to have been bullshitting us all along the way.</p>
<p>Is this sub sarcastic?  It's certainly no less sarcastic that governors who threaten to fine and imprison churchgoers and protesters for violating the vary same distancing and crowd size guidelines flaunted by BLM and ANTIFA protesters last summer for instance... but then again we may be unable to process such advanced intellectual functions.</p>
<p>So you see that because I'm possibly congenitally incapable of recognizing or expressing sarcasm, I'm not going to be able to satisfy your completely honest, fair, and unbiased curiosity of this sub.</p>

<p>You posted a (now deleted) missive taking a shot at us and now complain about a defensive tone in response.</p>

        <p>I'll share just one early detail that has pretty much painted most of everything else with a deep shade of skepticism for me:</p>
<p>In my area, the economy was basically being shut down.  Governors coordinated a regional approach to the pandemic and issued their very similar orders accordingly.  This I really did not have a proble going along with- it seemed to hold a little water</p>
<p>Within one week my work (which had been deemed "essential") began instituting rules about distancing... marking were place on cafeteria tables using electrical tape and we were advised about using common facilities- fingerprint biometrics was disabled on the time clocks and we each were given two styluses to punch in and out to avoid cross contact. Again, no problem.  News of manufacturing shut downs, retail (except for food) closures and the emergency halting of distribution apart from items already enroute and perishable food items as well as medication.</p>
<p>Within a few days of this we received and affixed floor stickers- spaced six feet apart.  Blue, circular decals bearing the new slogan "Social Distancing" and picture a pair of bare human footprints- these adhesive decals were clearly special made for this situation.  "Social Distancing" was quite a new expression- presumably coined to help folks remember behaviors that were designed to prevent person-to-person transmission in a process we were barely two weeks into.</p>
<p>My previous job involved printing and die cutting.  "Rush" orders that were placed that called for materials we already had (printing plates, cutting dies, etc.) generally took two weeks to process, run through the various manufacturing processes and ultimately ship.  This was clearly something that materials, designs, layouts, and such were presumably not even in existence a mere two weeks previous when the first confirmed cases were hitting the news and we were still lulled into assuming that the situation could be contained.</p>
<p>Yet I found myself in my work cafeteria staring down at some very professional quality floor stickers one and one half weeks into a public health emergency that supposedly had caught everyone off guard prompting almost all means of production and distribution stopped and I smelled a rat from that day.</p>
<p>No, it does not prove anything- but it meant my eyes were already opened when neighboring New York's Governor Cuomo ordered that nursing homes admit active CV-19 cases for recovery from an uncontrolled and wildly contagious virus so dangerous that otherwise healthy people had to stay home.  I could go on and on and on.</p>

        <p>My background in printing and die cutting (which were both used in the production of the decals) told me that there was barely enough time to get them produced and shipped assuming the materials and layouts/designs already existed and shipping wasn't being stopped.</p>
<p>These were created for the specific situation and at least from my standpoint, at very least had to have already been produced and ready to ship when the pandemic first started.</p>
<p>No it does not definitively <em>prove</em> anything, but it is a big part of what my skepticism is founded on.</p>
