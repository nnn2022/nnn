    <strong>Our lives are ruined I need to vent</strong>
    <p><p>My partners entire way of life has been decimated and mine along with it. He was a busker who traveled Europe in his van. He was no mediocre busker either, he’s ridiculously talented classical musician. He’s been offered recording contracts and opportunities to work with famous bands in the past but he always turned it down because he could make more money on the streets and at art festivals. I’m talking between 500-1000 euros a day - he was one of the most successful buskers in the world. Saving never occurred to him because how could he have forseen this.</p>
<p>When he was travelling and playing music he was so deep in his element that he WAS an element, he was fire, it burned in his eyes and in the hearts of anyone who heard his beautiful music. He brought people to tears, moved them to dance, he brought beauty and magic into the world.</p>
<p>And now. Now he’s completely broken. He hasn’t worked for about a year and a half now, the police take instruments from performers here in Portugal, there are no tourists and it looks like there never will be again because the fucking vax that people have been so gleefully sticking in themselves looks like it’s going to cause bloodclots making it too dangerous to fly.
The PCR tests cost €100 a pop, and they are mandatory for crossing borders. Economies are wrecked, everyday basics are fast becoming unaffordable. The foundation of our lifestyle and livelihood has been attacked and destroyed.</p>
<p>All I’ve ever wanted was to be a mum. We were going to buy land and build a little house this year. Now we can’t afford it and I’m now worried about the ethics of bringing a child into a world like this. The masks are probably here forever, I imagine it wont be long before healthcare is refused to the unvaccinated. I’m so ANGRY. I’m so so so fucking furious at all the people who are letting this happen, keeping each other in line, snitching on their neighbours. Everything worth living for has been sacrificed in the name of ‘saving the old’. Fuck this, fuck the elites, fuck the sheep, fuck you all for crushing one of the brightest spirits I ever met, the love of my life. FUCK</p></p>

        <p>Wow, that's terrible.  Sorry to hear.  Do you have a contingency plan?  Family? Friends? Alternate careers?  There will be a plethora of people changing careers due to this pandemic.  Don't give up hope.  Things will work out for the two of you, in the end.</p>
<p>Where there's a will, there's a way. Hang in there!</p>

        <p>Thank you ❤️
The thought of a normal job (are there even any left?!) is pretty dismal after a career founded on creativity and freedom. We’re currently loosing our minds trying to make money with crypto... I do think we’ll find a way. We have to find a way. At least thats how I frame it in my moments of optimism, but then I remember the smart cities and the points system and all these awful things looming on the horizon. </p>
<p>I’m typing this from a beautiful coastal cliff and EVERYONE IS WEARING A MASK! I swear to god I want to push them off.</p>

        <p>They are not 'elites' they are a parasitic over class who have inserted themselves like a toxic virus into our systems of government, business and finance to destroy and kill off huge numbers of souls so they can do what they like with the planet. It's ironic they're sing a virus to achieve this when they act exactly the same.</p>

        <p>Holy fuck it needs to happen. But as I said in a previous reply, I’m currently on a wild costal cliff and everyone is in a mask so we’ll probably have to wait till the vax wipes them out before we’ll have a chance of success. Man my mind is in a dark place</p>

        <p>It was seasonal, we’d work during the holiday season (not every day either) and spend the rest in the winter renting a place and recording albums. Just before the pandemic  our van skidded off the road and we spent almost everything repairing it - we didn’t think of saving.</p>
