    <strong>Lockdown could’ve ended months ago.</strong>
    <p><p>The lockdown would have ended months ago if people knew how to wash their hands or wear a mask. But no that’s too hard for all these free thinkers because you’re all too smart to fall for government propaganda. Masks are just for weak people and pussies because it’s just a cold and 99% of people recover from COVID. I guess pretending you’re smarter than everyone else for not washing your hands makes you feel special because this sub loves to talk down to us sheep. I’m a sheep because I try to protect myself from a disease that won’t affect but will kill my grandparents, my cousin with asthma or someone else I’ll never meet. Yup I’m a sheep for having empathy but the guy who walks through a hospital without a mask is lion who sees past the governments lies. Anti-maskers and Anti-Vaxers are the same exact thing, grow the fuck up and wash your hands. Now go ahead and tell me I’m an idiot because I return my fucking shopping cart.</p></p>

        <p>If most people are wearing masks, taking precautions, getting tested frequently, and/or engaging in other "safety" measures then why would cases surge? If the lockdowns, masks, and other stuff worked, there would be a stark decrease. Sure, there would still be cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, but they would be declining. As I said before, in the states I've been to in the northeast, there's been a 100% compliance rate in essence. I, myself, basically wear masks and have my temperature taken all the time. But my state has been "surging" for months.</p>

        <p>No matter how many people wear masks and lockdown there’s always that one asshole that’s gonna spread it to his entire office or one kid that gives it to his entire school. Sure some people will wear masks in public but for the most part Americans just don’t give a shit. the majority of Americans honestly don’t care if a stranger lives or dies, even if the only thing they have to do is wash their hands and keep 6 feet distance.  All these safety measures do work but they don’t work overnight. It’s gonna be years before we see any decrease in cases or deaths. no matter what the majority of people do there will always be a minority of people that just can’t be fucking bothered to practice basic hygiene.</p>

<p>But if most, if not all, other people are wearing masks, and masks are effective in preventing the spread (especially when coupled with other measures like sanitization) then why would one person spread it to an entire office or an entire school? </p>
<p>Wouldn't that mean masks don't work? That many of these safety measures also don't work?</p>

        <p>Because masks only work with a 100% compliance. I know that’s contradicting what I said before but enforcing mask rules in small spaces like stores, offices, schools and hospitals is actually possible compared to enforcing mask rules nation wide. You can’t force every redneck in America to wash his hands but you can force your employees/students to follow basic hygiene rules.</p>

        <p>If you asked us questions instead of attacking people we would be glad to have a conversation. Reading your post, it seems fueled by emotion. If you want to use a mask go right ahead, we are not going to bother you. But when I'm yelled at by baristas for taking my mask off when sitting down alone, its not about safety at that point, its about control. When I'm attacked for having a different viewpoint then I'm going to stand firm until a reasonable argument allows me to change my mind.</p>

        <p>Buddy it’s stops being about your viewpoint when that baristas grandmother has lung cancer or pneumonia. My post is fueled by emotion because your lack of empathy is literally killing people. It’s the same thing with anti-vax parents, it’s not about YOU it’s about other people. That’s what you don’t understand no one gives a shit about controlling you they care about protecting themselves and their families from you.</p>

        <p>You’re so fucking hypocritical, “if you have someone in your family who is immunocompromised, you need to take better care of them and try not to infect them” what do you think that barista was doing when she told you to put on your mask? Yea I guess you’re right tho I guess it’s too optimistic to assume other people have enough basic compassion to wear a mask, especially around someone like a barista that has to interact with hundreds of people everyday. I guess reality is that some people are so childish they’ll not only expose someone to the virus they’ll assume that everything is about them and people are trying to control them.</p>

        <p>Whataboutism, also known as whataboutery, is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument. Whataboutism is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda.</p>

        <p>You’re right it’s not your problem. That summarizes this sub pretty well. No basic human empathy or compassion just “Not my problem”. But go ahead and tell me I’m a child and a sheep because I take five extra seconds to put on a mask so some baristas grandma doesn’t die of COVID. But to answer your question yes I am a child because I care about the health of my family and strangers so much I wash my hands and wear a piece of cloth over my mouth and apparently that’s considered childish.</p>

        <p>You are missing the point. Your expectations of people are unreasonable and getting mad about it, is childish. You have a warped view of this world.</p>
<p>My grandmother is a drinker, smoker, has had multiple heart surgeries. I care about her so I do what I can to protect her. I would never expect a stranger to care about her, much less go out of their way to keep her healthy.</p>
<p>What sheltered life have you lived that you think complete strangers give a shit about you? Holding that belief would actually make you quite easy to take advantage of.</p>
<p>I'll be nice here and say that for your own good and mental health, you should stop having expectations of people. </p>
<p>I'll also add that I do not represent this sub, I just post here. To assume I alone represent this sub is a generalization, another example of you having low intelligence. Easy to manipulate.</p>

        <p>Uh huh ok buddy sure you’re right it’s stupid to assume that strangers would care about my family. It’s extremely stupid to assume anyone would want to help or even care about a stranger. Wearing a mask really just comes down to basic empathy and it’s clear that your parents did a real great job of raising you, what kind of things did they say? “No one in the world will care about you so just be a jackass because fuck other people.” I also find it very sad your grandmother has a grandchild that doesn’t care about her enough to wear a mask or wash his hands, imagine a total stranger caring about your family more than you. Yet In reality I can’t control you or anyone else you can do whatever the fuck you want. only you can control your own actions so when you choose to be an inconsiderate douchebag it says a lot more about you than it does about me. I’ll also add that I’ve read through a couple of the posts on this sub I’m very confident you represent this community perfectly, someone who thinks they’re special and smart just because they’re an asshole.</p>

        <p>If you asked us questions instead of attacking people we would be glad to have a conversation. Reading you post and it seems fueled by emotion, if you want to use a mask go right ahead, we are not going to bother you. But when I'm yelled at by baristas for taking my mask off when sitting down alone, its not about safety at that point, its about control. When I'm attacked for having a different viewpoint then I'm going to stand firm until a reasonable argument allows me to change my mind.</p>
