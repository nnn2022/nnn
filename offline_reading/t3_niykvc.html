    <strong>Our local theme park opened today.</strong>
    <p><p>And I just wanted to share my experience with their clown logic. I went to Kings Island in Ohio as soon as they opened this morning, and went straight for their new coaster: Orion. They lifted their mask mandate in outdoor areas ("unless it's impossible to maintain social distancing"). There were almost no masks on guests, and everyone waited in line as packed together as though covid never happened. I got on the ride, and the seats were not wiped down or anything between riders. I mention this because afterwards, I cashed in on my souvenir cup voucher. And they handed me a paper cup with the plastic one. I was supposed to fill the paper cup and pour it into the plastic one. Out of habit I just started filling the plastic one, and so did a family to my right. Some manager-looking guy swooped down like a hawk, leaned over the handrail behind us, and told us that we can't touch the plastic cups to the machine because it'll contaiminate it. He didn't hear me, or else ignored me when I said "even if we literally just bought it?" He explained that they were trying to keep everyone safe and i said to the woman next to me "even though I'm standing here next to you, without a mask on?" She smiled and fake coughed as I walked away. All in all, though, it was nice to see so many people not giving a flying fuck about masks or social distancing and just enjoying the sunshine and fun atmosphere.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Theme park does away with mask mandate, doesn't wipe down rides between guests, but wants you to fill a paper cup and pour it into your souvenir cup to avoid "contaiminating the machine".</p></p>

        <p>Dollywood still tries to make us wear a mask, but when I went a few days ago, I noticed that nobody wore a mask or distanced at all. We’re tired of this pandemic.</p>

        <p>Their policy online says they aren’t requiring masks anymore so you should have told security or the employee bothering you to fuck off</p>

        <p>I went to six flags today. No masks, and covid rules virtually unenforced at all. It was wonderful.</p>

        <p>Sounds awesome, just book a week off work to do a massive trip to Kings Island and Cedar Point. Didn't get to do any coasters last year so I'm making up for it this year. Haven't been to Kings Island in forever, last time I was there Son of Beast was still standing</p>

        <p>Yep no masks outside at Cedar Fair parks unless the state requires it. Six Flags has adopted the same policy. If you go just avoid indoor areas it's easy to do in an amusement park since 95% of the stuff is outside. Oh and rides are at full capacity, no more BS social distancing on a ride so you don't social distance in line...</p>

        <p>I'm not sure. But they're both owned by Cedar Fair and they're both in Ohio so I'd be inclined to say that's correct.</p>
