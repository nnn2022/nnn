    <strong>Correlating current restrictions with nazism.</strong>
    <p><p>Tyranny happens in stages, often under the guise of something else. To keep you safe. Turning neighbours against one another. DIVIDE. Of course, Nazism was <strong>far far far</strong> worse than anything the western world is going through right now but we can still find some correlations, with reputable sources. </p>
<p><strong>Remember, nazism didn't happen overnight.</strong></p>

<p>Above is some BBC bitesize for children on how the Nazis remained in power. And here's how it correlates. (Feel free to comment with your own sources.)</p>
<p>The Gestapo (Geheime Staatspolizei, Secret State Police) were the Nazis’ secret police. It played a crucial role in Germany’s internal security. <strong>(COVID Martials UK)</strong></p>

<p>Many ordinary Germans also informed on one another for personal gain or out of jealousy. This created tension and fear throughout the country. <strong>(Neighbours snitching on each other)</strong></p>

<p>The army became a visible presence in everyday German life. Flags, symbols and uniformed troops on the streets all created a clear impression of the power of the Nazi government. <strong>(Army on the streets to help mass test children in UK cities, Liverpool, why the army?)</strong></p>

<p>The SD was also responsible for tracking foreign opposition to the Nazis. This included censoring media. <strong>(Anything against the official narrative, have you seen the state of Facebook/Twitter and it's censorship presently?)</strong></p>

<p>The SD (Sicherheitsdienst) was the Nazi Party's intelligence and security service. Under the command of Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heidrich, the SD aimed to keep every individual in Germany under constant supervision. <strong>(Snowden, NSA, GCHQ)</strong></p>
