    <strong>This is when I knew the pandemic was a SHAM</strong>
    <p><p>I can pinpoint precisely when I knew that the pandemic was a SHAM…</p>
<p>First, this is NOT one of those quack proclamations that the virus is a hoax or that we’re all being microchipped. </p>
<p>It is important to sympathize with those who have been sick/died. And we need to acknowledge our global frontline workers for the sacrifices they have made over the past year and a half. </p>
<p>However, it is equally important to acknowledge that some inconceivably sketchy shit has been allowed to take place right in front of our eyes throughout the entirety of the pandemic. And demanding answers does not make you a conspiracy theorist or a tinfoil hat collector, despite what the media may have you believe.</p>
<p>I never really understood how shutting down the world, crippling the economy, and robbing so many people of their livelihoods made any sense whatsoever. Not for a virus that was harmless to most people. But I am no scientist. “What the hell do I know?” I thought to myself. If staying home was going to keep my grandma safe, I could buy into that. </p>
<p>But I started having doubts about the Covid narrative when my friend--who is an immigrant from a third world country--told me that his uncle had died of a heart attack back home. But even though he was grieving, he was more concerned with what happened the following day…</p>
<p>The next afternoon, his family received a knock on their door. Somebody offered them money if they agreed to sign a document declaring Covid as the cause of death. They are poor. They took the money.</p>
<p>Sketchy? Definitely. But I chalked it up to corruption in a third world country. Except a few weeks later, I had lunch with a friend of mine who is a nurse. She told me the story of a terminally ill patient who had died on her floor. </p>
<p>The doctor on shift received a mysterious phone call telling him to change the cause of death from cancer to Covid. When the doctor refused, the voice on the other end said something to the effect of “Well we’re doing it anyway”.</p>
<p>I asked who could have been on the other end of the call. She had no idea. Nor did she want to know. She was married with two young kids, and just barely surviving a year of isolation, while working in an ER during a pandemic. She was not asking questions that went above her paygrade.</p>
<p>Do I just surround myself with whackos? Perhaps. But here were two people with absolutely zero to gain, and everything to lose by speaking up.</p>
<p>One was an immigrant in a foreign country, just trying to become a citizen, and make a better life for himself. He did not have a large social network. He was not holding a megaphone on a street corner, spouting conspiracy theories to passersby. It was a private conversation between two friends. The other was a nurse in the front lines. She was not about to stand up and risk being ostracized by her peers in the medical community. She was just trying to get through each day.</p>
<p>I have a relatively small social bubble. Yet somehow, I knew two people with stories so shady, you could not even script them in a movie. Neither had any interest in speaking up and risking trouble for themselves. Nor did they have an outlet to share their stories even if they wanted to. </p>
<p>THERE ARE SO MANY MORE PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WITH STORIES JUST LIKE THESE, BUT NOWHERE TO HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD!</p>
<p>How many nurses and doctors around the world have been forced to say silent for fear of being an outcast? How many people have witnessed corruption during the pandemic, but either can’t speak up, or don’t want to risk being persecuted?</p>
<p><strong>Stinky Bat Soup</strong> is an online forum where people can post their sketchiest Covid stories anonymously for the world to read. We will expose the unfathomable fraud/greed that has fueled the hysteria and turned so many people against each other in a time when we desperately need to stay united.  </p>
<p>So many critical decisions during the pandemic have prioritized the pursuit of profit first, political legacies second, and health/safety a distant third. And we all deserve to know the truth after how much everyone has suffered over the past 15 months.</p>
<p>There are so many questions we should be demanding answers for. Remember when they said this whole thing started because somebody ate a bat? Why were hospitals given financial incentives to have patients die of Covid? How were cheap malaria meds found to be “dangerous” in the treatment of the virus, yet people who were sick swear Hydroxycholoroquine saved their lives? </p>
<p>SOMETHING STINKS!</p>
<p>Please share this with your friends. Please share this with your family. Implore them to share it with their friends and family. And anyone who might not think they have a voice. For the people who have died. For those who have lost their jobs, businesses and homes. For anyone whose physical, mental and financial wellbeing has been irreparably destroyed. </p>
