    <strong>Danish Study Proves Masks Are Mostly Ineffective</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</p>
<p>Conclusion: 
“The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection.”</p></p>

        <p>Even if they were effective, the virus would have to be much deadlier for me to be afraid enough to want to wear one.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't go so far as to say 'prove' here.</p>
<p>The study was small (yes, &lt;7K people is small in the real world) and there were numerous other factors that could be involved in the statistically small difference between the groups that wore masks and those that did not wear masks as far as catching CoVid-19 goes.</p>
<p>However it does merit further study.</p>

        <p>Please everybody; STOP running on the hamster wheel of incessant mask debate, and start learning and talking about the things that people <strong>CAN DO</strong> for themselves to help their immune systems function properly instead of injuring or killing them when challenged with weak pathogens such as SARS2 virus or influenza virus.</p>

        <p>We got it. People can talk about things they can do to help their immune system, and also talk about masks. The difference is there is no mandate that says I can't talk about things that can help the immune system, while there are mandates that force me to wear masks in public.</p>

        <p>&rt;People can talk about things they can do to help their immune system, and also talk about masks.</p>
<p>If I were to look through your post and comment history since April, whenever the mask BS really got going, roughly how many posts or comments about "these are things that people can do to help their immune system be healthy when challenged with this virus in order to avoid a need to seek hospital care" do you estimate I'd find?</p>
<p>I estimate zero, but I see that you've recently made 3 posts in this sub to keep people on the hamster wheel.</p>
<p>&rt;there are mandates that force me to wear masks in public.</p>
<p>That's a very serious problem.  Very serious problems need solutions.  How far has running on the hamster wheel gotten you towards solving that?  I think it hasn't gotten us very far.</p>
<p>The people pulling our strings are making noises about "having to" wear masks for years to come.</p>
<p>Do you know why there is a mask mandate where you live, and where I live too?</p>
<p>It's because people are taking up hospital beds when they get infected with this pretty weak virus.</p>
<p>Do you know why people are taking up hospital beds when they get infected with this pretty weak virus?</p>
<p>It's because their individual immune system is too weak to outplay this virus the way that it evolved for 500 million years <strong>to be able to do</strong>.  Most people's immune system can outplay the virus without taking up a hospital bed, but some can't and THAT'S the crux of the sociatal burden in this.</p>
<p>Their immune system is too weak to outplay this virus because they don't even KNOW that there are things that they can do to make their immune system be healthy, much less WHAT to do.</p>
<p>They don't know anything about that because so so many people are keeping them on the fucking incessant mask debate hamster wheel.</p>
<p>Here you are saying "people should keep running on the hamster wheel".</p>
<p>Maybe if you just keep running on the hamster wheel long enough, you will get somewhere.</p>
<p>Meanwhile people getting sick, and some even dying, is fine because watching other people die and not doing something meaningful about it is the new normal of being civilized, I guess.</p>
<p>If people start making their immune systems healthier, fewer and fewer people take up hospital beds when they become infected, and the wind in the sails of the pro-maskers dies off.</p>
<p>There'd no longer be ANY argument or justification for mask mandates or lockdowns or ANY of that BS.</p>
<p>&rt;there is no mandate that says I can't talk about things that can help the immune system</p>
<p>Yeah, almost everybody is voluntarily making sure nobody talks about things that can help the immune system, including trying to oppress other people that advocate for it.</p>

        <p>It’s a pretty awful study. Let’s not also fall into the trap of clinging to bad science because it fits our narrative. It doesn’t conclude or prove shit for either side of the mask debate.</p>

        <p>It just confirms what the current, real-world data has shown, and what pretty much every study on the subject pre-2020 concluded. This is just more current and is one more argument that goes against the mainstream narrative. Its not an awful study. It's a pretty normal study.</p>

        <p>I think we could at the very least conclude that the virus still spreads to a degree amongst masked people, this much is obvious with cases skyrocketing even in high mask compliance places. So a mask isn’t a magic shield and anyone saying that “if everyone wore masks this would be over” is deluded.</p>
