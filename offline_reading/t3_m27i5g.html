    <strong>Is there a website that shows a map of countries and their corresponding levels of lockdown?</strong>
    <p><p>Just very curious to see what countries in the world have any lockdown policies right now.</p>
<p>For example: UK highest level, Czech Republic medium level, Sweden/Florida lowest level.</p>
<p>Only website I've seen with one is www.skyscanner.com but their map is completely incorrect lool</p></p>

        <p>I've been looking, and it's difficult. But as far as air travel into the a country goes, I know Kayak has a nice one that can be a good first step.They separate countries into four color-coded categories on a world map:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Completely Closed (Philippines, Vietnam, Norway, 50 total)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partially Open (US, UK, Australia, 122 total)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reopening Soon (India, Bangladesh, Mongolia, 5 total)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Restrictions (Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, 43 total)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with an option to view countries with mandatory quarantines as only "Partially Open" as opposed to "No Restrictions".</p>
<p>I like to check out the countries with no restrictions and no quarantine, then look deeper via other website into whether they have mask mandates, curfews, business restrictions, etc.</p>

        <p>Cheers, that's a good start. Much better than the Skyscanner one.</p>
<p>Would be nice if they showed internal restrictions, like on bars and shopping once you're in the country</p>

        <p>I don't think that would actually tell you much. Like for example here in Italy, we have lockdowns and all, but people give so little fucks that the only real restriction is that you can't hang out at a bar after 6pm. Other than that it doesn't matter what you do because even cops don't give a flying fuck. And it's similar in the Philippines. Almost entire family of my wife's lives there and even though they have some really severe restrictions, for all intents and purposes people do whatever the heck they want.</p>

<p>I live in the UK, and it is the same here for my age group. No one my age has followed the rules since everyone was genuinely scared during the first couple of months of the restrictions. All through January, there were house parties on every street still.</p>
<p>It's not the point of what I'm looking for really though, I'm just trying to see where the governments are saner than my own.</p>
