    <strong>The Company I work for will soon be discriminating.</strong>
    <p><p>The company I work for is a huge american company with facilities all over the world. I am based at one of its UK facilities. I've worked there for years and have nothing but praise for it. To be honest it's a fantastic company to work for. However we have been masked since pretty much the start of covid. We wear lots of ppe anyway and this company pays me so I wear a mask every day at work ( don't wear a mask anywhere else) Today on our internal Internet website there is an alarming announcement. At our American branches on June 21st those with a vaccine don't have to wear masks . Those without vaccines have to wear masks until they can prove they have had the vaccine. Soon as with lots of things, these rules will be passed onto my workplace. Do any of you know how the law works? Is it legal to discriminate like this? Loads of my colleagues (who don't want the vaccine) are saying they will now have the vaccine so they don't have to wear masks anymore. They will have to drag me from my house and hold me down and inject me. That's the only way I will be vaccinated but this simple threat of no vaccine=indefinite masking has folded so many people. This company pays our wages, how can I get people to stand against these bullshit rules?</p></p>

        <p>One thing that might make you medically exempt (this is the reason masks are no longer mandated at my work, or at least won’t be enforced anymore) is being prone to heat illness. One worker had heat stroke while working outside in a surgical mask, and our safety department went ballistic. I’m no longer allowed (I’m the foreman at this site) to require any of my workers to wear a mask while doing exterior work, not that I was anyway.</p>
<p>Apparently if you’ve had any form of heat exhaustion in the past, you’re far more susceptible to it in the future, so I wonder if you could claim something like that if your job is physical.</p>

        <p>I bet you can get papers in Tijuana. You may be able to tie it up in court also. </p>
<p>The government knows it's more effective to pressure business to get people, hurt them in their wallet. Even the billionaire Zuckerberg, who was once opposed, was forced to come around in public.</p>

        <p>My company (Carrier) announced yesterday that after presenting proof of vaccination you'll receive a sticker on your badge and don't have to wear mask. I contacted HR and told them that this is stigmatizing and has ethical and even legal ramifications, to which they replied with standard bs along the lines of "our attorneys cleared this, everyone else is doing it and talk to us if you feel discriminated".</p>
<p>My plan is to not tell anyone at work my vaccination status with the pretext of "this has a become a politically toxic topic and I keep sociopolitical controversy away from work". And just wear my mask until no one cares anymore or the FDA removes the requirement due to the percentage of inoculated people being so large that the unvaccinated don't matter.</p>
<p>Or maybe we have another wave, the news blame the unvaccinated and the controversy extends further.</p>

        <p>Start seeing a doctor for "breathing issues" (asthma, shortness of breath, etc) After 3 months it becomes a chronic issue and, if full-time, you can apply for an FMLA accommodation to nor wear a mask. If your job denies you your job after an FMLA approval, they can be sued on the grounds of FMLA and ADA violations.</p>

        <p>I think you just gotta wear your mask at work man. That's nowhere as bad as what the NFL have been doing to their players with discrimination. The way it works at your job is the same as mine. A handful of states are lifting lockdown rules, NY just did. Wait for this bb</p>
