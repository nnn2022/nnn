        <p>May I make a suggestion? Either go back to the weekly threads, or at least include a link to the previous day's thread. What's the point of commenting in these if it's effectively deleted after 24 hours, or a lot less if you happen to comment just a few hours before the new thread goes up?</p>

        <p>I never thought the weekly thread was particularly unreadable, either. I don't remember them topping more than 30 or 40 messages most weeks. </p>

        <p>The vax card virtue signaling on social media is truly annoying...</p>
<p>I have also seen people who got it, but I have no idea HOW they are even eligible. For instance this 34 year old I know with no conditions and telework a for a living just got it, and her UNEMPLOYED brother who is around her age as well also got it. It makes no sense.</p>
<p>And these are the people who claimed lockdowns were to save grandma- and now, they are pushing the vulnerable out of the way to get their vaccine. Interesting.</p>

        <p>It's almost like a repeat of last year with Covid tests in the NYC / NJ area. Tests were limited in supply but the well off and connected were obtaining them to continue their lifestyle. There was ridiculous social media outrage and exposes in the NY Post about it. I predicted the same thing would happen with the vaccine and sure enough I was vindicated. How to be a hero in 2021 - WFH, order delivery, change social media pic to black square for a week, and now post proof of experimental vax injection.</p>

        <p>Yeah.  I know lots of people who keep posting about those will-call lists.  I know some of the vaccines need to be used quickly, but it seems crazy that a few people I know who don’t meet any of the criteria have gotten the vaccine that way when I have other friends who have been trying to schedule their parents for weeks but can never get appointments.  It <em>looks</em> like one of the sites might still prioritize people on the list, but I wasn’t going to go through the signup process to find out.</p>

        <p>I'm getting annoyed reading about "free" states that still require masks everywhere. An example is Florida where cities like Orlando, Miami and Ft. Lauderdale are extremely strict about masks. It's hard to get excited about states dropping the mask mandate when cities and businesses can still require masks AND enforce whatever COVID restrictions they want. I feel like my locked down state of NC is no worse off than most areas of "free" Texas and Florida.</p>

        <p>Definitely the case in most big cities. I'm in a medium-sized Texas city and there is no noticeable difference now that we're "free". The city itself continues all its mandates and of course every private business voluntarily follows the same.</p>
<p>Maybe only if you went to a state park would you be able to walk around in public without a mask (fully legally). And for all I know there's already a loophole which allows them to enforce masks as well!</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm thinking that whenever my state decides to drop the masks, that most businesses will still require them "in the abundance of safety". Maybe a grocery store or two will no longer enforce them and gas stations already don't give a fuck but I still feel like I won't see any noticable difference.</p>

        <p>Ok so theres something I dont understand in regards to the hardcore doomers that wish death on us, particularly in regards to those here that wont get the vaccine.
Why would we all of a sudden start to die when we refuse the vaccine and everyone else gets it. We've had this shit go on for over a year and most of us have ditched masks for a long time now along with just going about our lives as normal, no distancing etc. So chances are we've been exposed to covid already and are probably overall healthier people than the doomers. With vaccines stopping the spread too, why are they saying we're all going to die now. It makes no sense. Like just no, nothing changes for us. Yes doomers rarely make sense but I just can't see how they are capable of such Olympic level mental gymnastics to say this shit seriously.</p>

        <p>IMO they think that we just complain but have been complying the whole time and that's why we are not dead.

        <p>I doubt anyone who has ever posted in this sub has died of covid (excluding trolls). I don't know anyone for whom covid was anything more than a nuisance cold. I'm sure there are others who caught it and never noticed. The reality is that covid has always been a non issue outside of extreme end-of-life populations. But we dare not say that last part out loud.</p>

        <p>Doomer here, trust me I’m surrounded by folks sick of this shit like y’all are, and I personally can’t wait for this assfuckery to be done and dusted with. I feel like the whole “no shot you gonna die” thing may come from the emergence of these new variants of the virus. We don’t know enough about them yet to be able to know for sure if its like that, but a good portion of it is just us wanting this to go away sooner before we have to find out. Hope this little bit of my perspective helps!</p>

        <p>Well I suppose that would depend on your definition of the term doomer. If its on the basis of an age group then I suppose I would be one, or if its based on attitude or general outlook on life that would change my ability to call myself one.</p>

        <p>The risk comes as a result of economies opening back up, which is as a result of increasing levels of vaccination.</p>
<p>As restrictions are eased more and more businesses will be open and more people will be out and about, increasing social interaction. However, for the various vaccines to be truly effective, you need to reach a critical mass of the population, typically around 60%, to induce a herd immunity state.</p>
<p>If this level is not reached you run increased risk of seeing a spike in cases among those not vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I'm in quite a pickle. I got a wedding invitation from my cousin today. The wedding is in July and it's out of state but the RSVP is due April 2nd.</p>
<p>I'm hoping things will be somewhat normal by July, but given that the wedding is in Illinois, who knows. If it's gonna be a hassle everywhere I go, I won't bother. If the airlines are still doing their mask shit, I'll drive. It saves on a rental car but it's a long drive.</p>
<p>Do you think Illinois will have gotten its shit together by July? Do you think airlines will still require masks at that point? I know it's just a wedding, but I just want to go places again. Last time I left the state was last January.</p>

        <p>I'd like to think it would be better by then, but you should really start planning for the trip with driving in mind. Governor Porky said he won't be lifting the mandates soon nor will airlines. Masks will be the very last thing to go, if ever.</p>
<p>As for the venue, you better hope it's not woke enough to force you to wear one, especially if it's outdoors.</p>

        <p>This is why I'm on the fence. I'm OK with driving but if I get there and I find out everyone needs to put a mask on (the venue is 50/50 outdoors/indoors but in a rural area), I'll be very upset. Not to mention outside of the wedding there will be nothing to do but rot in a hotel room.</p>

        <p>If the venue is in a rural area, it might be worth a shot. Look into it and the surrounding area before you go. Make sure the venue doesn't have anybody patrolling the grounds to mask-check people.  I imagine the mask mandate won't be too much of a hassle if you're just staying at the venue and the hotel.</p>
<p>That's if your cousin isn't enforcing one of his own.</p>

        <p>The invitation makes no mention of it, so I'm assuming it's a do what you're comfortable with deal, but I'm not sure. I can check their website, but that's how things are now.</p>
<p>Keep in mind if this goes away in July, none of this matters. The problem is the upcoming RSVP date. I think I'll give it a week to see if any news happens.</p>

        <p>I wish I had hope and was excited about things reopening. I’m not sure if I believe it will happen exactly as this video says, but I can’t shake the feeling that something is coming.</p>

        <p>I need to buy some maternity clothes but I hate shopping.  I was looking up local places and found that my city has a maternity consignment shop that has the fitting rooms open.  The recent reviews were all about how the owner will not wear a mask if she is more than 6 feet from you.  So it looks like I have a business to patronize!</p>

        <p>Vent Confession: When Covid restrictions began and I knew little about it (the first week) my ex- roommate was trying to throw barbeques and parties, and I was annoyed greatly, because my bathroom is the guest bathroom.</p>
<p>I was trying to be a part of what I thought was the solution. Disinfected every door handle, lightswitch and cabinet in the house with stuff like Hibiclens. Even put off sex for a few weeks. Oh lawdy!</p>
<p>By the time I'd made it out the other side of the rabbit hole it was my roommate who was freaking out over everything. Crying about how they won't be able to visit their newborn niece if I give them Covid. MY DUDE! You invited all your bar buddies to the house for about a month before giving a heck. Put your mask on and shut your pie hole! <em>ahem</em> I wonder how they're doing now.</p>

<p>Hey conservatives, remember when we libertarians warned you about the police state and you called us paranoid, Well.. who's paranoid now?</p>
<p>It was so frustrating to talk to conservatives before this telling them the dangers of arming the Police, NSA, Military, etc, and Now, now the the cops are the liberals' side they finally understand... or do they?</p>

        <p>Can anyone tell me if they are seeing any stories on Reddit about the AZ vaccine and Europe? I think they are halting its use in most of Europe and investigating it in Italy criminally.</p>

        <p>The AstraZeneca VC has been halted for at least the next two weeks by the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and I believe the UK as there have been reports of blood clits forming in regards to the shot being administered. It is not currently believed to be the cause of the clots, also known as thrombosis, but is still being put on hold whilst the potential for any link between the two is investigated. This is the objective information I have found so far after hearing about it on tv earlier this evening. Hope this helps!</p>

        <p>I been following the news on it, I just don't see the news on Reddit.  I see it get posted but then it gets pulled down. There are also a ton of people defending the AZ vaccine based on its profit model, saying since its not going to make a profit it is getting bad press because of that, even though their profit model is not unique and only temporary.  It just seems like the AZ vaccine is part of some type of propaganda effort, or multiple ones, that I can't figure out.</p>

        <p>I frankly think that its being underreported or what ever you want to call it out of fear that this will push those already on the fence about the shit over the edge, and make them fearful enough to not get it, which impacts the ability to reach herd immunity. People want these shots to go out and want people to get them so we can get this further under control. And with the already large amount of people, at least here in the US, who have been polled and responded with “no shots” has the health agencies concerned about the growing number of folks who are in that crowd.</p>

        <p>thanks to a combination of at-risk with covid, wfh, and genuine discomfort with masks, I've spent most of the last year getting groceries delivered. </p>
<p>went to a big grocery store here for the first time in months and holy shit it's like it's still march 2020. no wonder people are on edge if this is being pumped into their brains every week, along with whatever crap they're told to put up with at work.</p>
<p>there's 269 people hospitalized for covid right now in BC, with 76 in "critical care". but you'd think you're in danger of dropping dead any second judging by the precautions at the grocery store. </p>
<p>utter insanity. no wonder people have lost their minds. I'd probably be right there too if I'd had that steady diet of fear pumped into my brain.</p>
