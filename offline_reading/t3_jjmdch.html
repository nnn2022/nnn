    <strong>Isolation is doing quite the number on me</strong>
    <p><p>I just wanna preface this by giving a lil background information. I know its probably weird to hear this, but I'm a 25 year old transgender (MtF) lib left leaning college student in a Southern state in the US. I bought into a lot of the media narrative surrounding Covid initially, but the more I locked myself in my home and observe what is going on the more I'm disagreeing and finding major problems with the way things are going. </p>
<p>Covid hitting coincided with me moving to a new town and finally getting real help with my problems and starting medical transition. I wanted badly to restart my life and make new friends and have fun for once, but I've been really restricted because of all this. I've been involved in a few online groups mostly with other LGBTQ+ ppl and I have noticed that nearly everybody im coming in contact with is drinking the mask wearing, social distanced kool-aid. I feel like if I say something out of line with that, I will become ostracized from these communities which are my only real places in which I feel comfortable with being myself. I love my community and it is killing me to see so many of us falling for so much pure propaganda. I also am afraid that I'll get ushered into places that are full of people ready to invalidate me because so many anti lockdown and anti mask spaces tend to be filled with people who look down on transgender people (or at least that is the perception). </p>
<p>I genuinely appreciate this entire subreddit and the differing people coming together to resist what I am seeing as a not so slow walk into full on totalitarianism, and I hope that maybe this is a sign that people from different walks and ideologies can come together to resist, even if only a little. Im a very extroverted person who feels very afraid to be open with most people for fear of being judged for my identity and my condition (that being gender dysphoria). Even if I am made to feel like I don't belong here or really anywhere, I just wanna say to everybody that what's being talked about here is really, really important and to keep going and keep hoping that we may get our lives back on track through all this. Thanks y'all</p></p>

        <p>That's rough.  It saddens me to see so much of humanity so easily sliding back into tribalism the moment things start to get hairy.  I suppose there's some sad humor in the intolerant behavior of the tribe of Tolerance, but I'm not laughing.  As a disaffected and somewhat hermitic liberal myself, I can't help but wonder how so many of my former political fellows lost the ability to tell the difference between "keeping an open mind" and "having no principles".</p>

        <p>I don't think of myself as trans but I have been using female hormones for 3 years (and dressing flamboyantly) 
This was also going to be my first year out and socialising as my new self so I feel your pain.</p>
<p>It's been a testing time for sure. All my transition stuff got put on hold and I've been dealing with some crazy hormonal mood swings, brought on by a dangerous mix of self medication, forced isolation, bi polarism and smoking tons of weed (which I had happily given up 3 years prior to March) </p>
<p>I started wearing masks because my confidence got so low during lockdown. But I find mask wearing really difficult, partly because, to pull off being a 6ft guy with Jayne Mansfield hair, I depend on my face and smile to cope with being in public. The few times I tried wearing a mask ended up with me having major panic attacks, because I felt so suffocated and repressed. Eventually I realised that the worst that happens if you take your mask off is that people stare at you but they were staring at me anyway, so it wouldn't change anything. So I recently gave up mask wearing and now I feel like I'm regaining my sanity bit by bit. This sub has helped me a lot too. It's good to know there are so many like minded people out there.</p>

        <p>That must be hard to be stuck in the middle of two worlds and not feel accepted by either. Maybe there's an intermediate community you can find for the time being, like ravers who just care about partying. Hopefully when you talk to your friends again you can give them a nudge to open their minds to the destruction lockdowns have caused. Maybe talk to people who will listen about how it's affecting you, doesn't have to be political, obviously, there's many liberals here who feel the same as you do. You can actually be the hero we all need. Someone who can be an example of a person who makes decisions based on science and logic and experience rather than just on what your peers and the media tell you to believe.</p>

        <p>I've been a lurker on here for a while, but want to really answer this.</p>
<p>I'm also a MtF transgender (24 years old) from Sweden who's been anti-new-normal from the beginning and I can relate to much you say.</p>
<p>Although Sweden hasn't had a lockdown, the availability of much healthcare did become postponed, especially the specialist departments of healthcare. In my case one hormonal check-up appointwas was postponed 3 months, which affected my mental health very badly due to certain reasons during the time around late spring. Luckily I'm feeling slightly better now except that I cannot stand distance-classes at university and social isolation.</p>
<p>I consider social interaction and self-determination as holy aspects of life (basically what makes life worth living for me haha), mostly because my long history of being a social isolated (parly due to ASD) and struggle to be myself and escape internalized stigma. This has made me very suspicous of authority in general and totalitarianism.</p>
<p>The process of getting my transition started was long (due to the infamous waiting lines in healthcare here, as well as I wanted to wait presenting until the hormones had done its work), so I lived many years socially isolated. I'm fully presenting now, but unfortunately the online-classes has made that I can't live life as myself fully for the moment. I can't tolerate this prolonged isolation since I've already spent way too much years isolated already.</p>
<p>If this pandemic had come earlier during the time I was waiting for medically starting the tranisiton, and my process was postponed due to diminished avability, it would be devastating. I'm worried about the Swedish transgenders who are in that position right now , especially since the waiting times has become longer since I started (for me it took 14 months). :'(</p>
<p>I wish you good luck and hope your transition will turn out good. If you'd want to talk, you can DM me. :)</p>

        <p>Yeah. Hopefully, society will add more value to liberty when the covid-hysteria is over. I believe meaningful relationships with others is central to human nature, as well as liberty according to natural law (philosophical concept). It's similar to alot of other social species when they are put in captivity isolated from their pack and nature, their behavior detoriates.</p>

        <p>Hey, nice to hear from someone from the lgbtq+ community in this sub :) I'm bi, gender questioning and an extrovert against restrictions. It's a small Venn diagram, but there are others out there who overlap! Sorry this post turned into a novel lol, these are some stories about other people between these worlds who I met or witnessed.</p>
<p>One of the few people from OkCupid who have been up for meeting in person during lockdown was genderqueer. Since I was shyer back then about my views on restrictions, I barely hinted at wanting to meet, which was such a drastic change from how outgoing I usually am, someone who takes the initiative. They mentioned have mashed potatoes earlier that day and I said, "I can imagine having a cozy comfort food date with you!" assuming that, if they agreed, it would just be over Zoom like all the lgbtq+ websites have been talking about. Instead, they said "If that's how you feel, how about we make it happen, if you're comfortable coming out?" and we did!</p>
<p>My favorite lgbtq+ pub was actually pretty late to switch to takeout, even compared to less outwardly liberal businesses. People were all, "How dare they keep partying during a pandemic!" and at the time I played along like "Uh, yeah, how horrible!..." later leaving all of my lgbtq+ Facebook groups because of the stress. I kept those who I was already Facebook friends with around, but only talked about very light stuff, like pets, until a few days ago, when I posted that I want everyone to be free to make their own choice about whether to do masks, social distancing, etc or not, that I don't support mandates or shaming people into restrictions, that I wish everyone good health, but don't support the ongoing social and economic devastation over this virus.</p>
<p>One trans fb friend left a heart on my status, and another left a hug! I was even more surprised by the second, because he had been posting about how sending children back to school would be murdering them, equivalent to sending them into a burning building. If even he came around a little bit, who knows what could happen?</p>

        <p>Hey!</p>
<p>I'm a fellow lib left, though I'm almost lib center because I'm pretty economically right,  but it's nice to see other people in these subs with different views, alignments, and experiences. I am so very sorry to hear that you don't feel comfortable sharing your lockdown views with the LGBTQ community. I'm not a part of it (though I am an ally!) but I know how important it is to a lot of people and it's very difficult when that type of thing becomes exclusive and you don't feel welcome anymore. It's very different, but I've been feeling the same way about the goth community. I don't like labels, but it is a music genre and style association that I adore and calling it goth is the easiest way I could find likeminded people. A common message in most alternative subcultures is to be anti-conformist and anti-authoritarianism, which has been completely lost through this pandemic (though I partially blame tiktok, the cesspool of "you have to be a communist to be alternative" misinformation) and it's really upsetting to see. Once again, somewhat different but it does suck to be young (18) and to no longer have a community that accepts freedom of thought. </p>
<p>I've been struggling a lot mentally throughout this pandemic as well, and I sincerely hope you at least find a little peace and feel welcomed by this little online community. You have to remind yourself, even though none of us believe it, that things are going to be okay. You don't need to be anyone else's expectation of you! I don't know if you're familiar with the book 1984 (a very good read in our current climate), but the main character's only hope is that, despite saying what the government wants him to, is that he doesn't believe it. What I'm trying to get at, is the only way this bullshit is going to stay forever is if we stop having it, even if we have to be silent right now. I hope you feel better soon :)</p>

        <p>I doubt it'll take that long to get a useable vaccine, and once the vaccine is out and given to enough people, the usefulness of masks will decrease significantly (although I expect that many people will continue to use them for a while by choice). Most sources are predicting such a vaccine by next year.</p>

        <p>Well, the nice thing about science is that the more we've screwed up in the past, the easier we can do those same things in the future. It goes with the territory, as science is heavily documented. I can read medical papers from the 40's documenting clumsy medical approaches that we've learned to refine to laser-precision by today.</p>
<p>There isn't really a question that we can create this vaccine, and relatively soon. The question is, given the urgent need for the vaccine, whether it'll be fully "ready" when it's deployed, especially since it's become politicized quite a bit. And that is something we should be looking at very closely. But it's certainly not beyond the capabilities of human beings to create a useable vaccine for COVID-19. </p>
<p>Whether you want to "buy" this or not is up to you, but don't forget that everyone, including the people who take COVID more seriously than this sub, wants things to go back to normal. We're all highly motivated to get this done, get the economy back and running, get back to seeing people and in the classrooms and such.</p>

        <p>Ok so I'm just supposed to trust the pharmaceutical giants who've totally proven they're in the business of life saving right? And I'm supposed to trust technocrats run governments to tell me when its ok to live again based on the potentiality of a vaccine that might not even be necessary?

        <p>I mean, it's not about trusting those agencies. Whether you trust them to release this vaccine or not is going to have absolutely zero effect on whether or not they release a useable vaccine next year. It'll only affect whether or not you choose to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>I don't trust the power pharmaceutical companies, and would put real money down that I've spent more words arguing against their influence than anyone on this sub. I also don't trust the government, especially this administration, given that they've politicized the issue and the President has made it clear that he wants a vaccine as an election boost.</p>
<p>But there are going to be a LOT of people, namely every medical science organization in the world, who will also be evaluating this vaccine. They won't have been involved in creating it. They won't be getting any of the profit from it. They don't have a dog in the fight. Some of these will be international organizations, who have absolutely no care whatsoever about how you personally choose to react to their findings, because they're looking to protect their own citizens.</p>
<p>Who you choose to trust is up to you, but I would certainly put more thought into it than simply denying anything that tells you what you don't want to hear. We all want this virus to be gone and to get our lives back, including the scientific authorities that will be independently evaluating any potential vaccine. Remember that if a vaccine is released that doesn't work or, even worse, hurts people, it's going to be catastrophic for the credibility of the people who created and endorsed it.</p>

        <p>See thats the thing. The virus won't be gone. Its foolish to think it'll just be gone I mean we have a flu vaccine and its not gone. Its not feasible when you get down to the meat of it. The first SARS is not gone nor is H1N1. They still exist and people still contract them just like many seasonal viruses. There is no way to eradicated SARS-Cov-2. There's a lot more to all this than just the virus itself.</p>

        <p>You are absolutely correct. It will not be gone.</p>
<p>But we will have a way to DIRECTLY fight it. Which is what matters. Because people do NOT like feeling helpless, and when there's a virus running around that we have absolutely no cure for, no way to effectively treat, and apparently shows permanent damage in some victims, people feel really helpless about it.</p>
<p>It's sort of like, say, fighting a predator trying to eat you. If I had to face some dangerous creature that wants to eat me, would I want to fight a tiger, or a shark? At least with the tiger, I am able to move around and fight or perhaps run. The environment is familiar, gravity works the way I expect, I can move properly.</p>
<p>But if I'm fighting a shark, then I'm in the water, I can't breathe, and I can't really move. I am far more helpless against a shark than a tiger. Both have teeth, and a shark doesn't even have arms. But I am far more afraid of the shark, because I have no real means of effectively fighting a shark.</p>
<p>The flu is something we can fight. We see it all the time. We know it kills people, but we have plenty of tools available to us to really put the odds in our favor. If someone dies from the flu, it's unlikely to be especially surprising. It's the tiger. It can kill us, but we have options.</p>
<p>With COVID, that's not the case. We don't know enough about it yet (it's "newness" is really the biggest threat it's posing to us), we don't have an effective means of fighting it, and we don't know what effects it will have in the future. It's the shark. In this case, the best thing we can do is stay out of the goddamn water (masks, distance, etc).</p>
<p>People will feel much more comfortable living in a shark-riddled environment if we pull those sharks up into the air and can fight them in a more familiar environment.</p>

        <p>You probably shouldn't trust them but they can deliver a vaccine that works and if it works more people "buy" it so the more they profit. PS: a vaccine will reduce the quarantine by a huge amount.</p>

        <p>How do you know when a vaccine will be widely distributed where OP lives? How do you know how OP's local government may react to a partially efficacious vaccine that only some of the people have had? How do you know when the effect on the pandemic of that vaccination campaign will translate politically into the repeal of a mask mandate in her locality? How do you know that the media won't keep up the pressure for permanent masking on pretext that Covid is endemic, and on pretext that influenza is dangerous too?  </p>
<p>Some of us just don't have that faith that a vaccine will be distributed, whereupon culture and the body politic will say "Okay guys, we're all done with masks now, finally." I certainly wish.</p>

        <p>Given the international response to COVID and the fact that most civilized countries have developed COVID vaccine deployment plans, I'm taking a leap of faith assuming that the OP lives in a country that has a functioning government. I admit I could be wrong. Chances are high that whatever vaccine is released will be released internationally, so efficacy problems in the vaccine will be known to the world pretty quickly (which I assume OP will know because of their demonstrated access to the internet to use Reddit).</p>
<p>I haven't yet figured out who this sub believes is benefiting from wearing masks except perhaps the mask manufacturers. Any government system relying on capitalism (most of them) wants people out buying useless things and engaging in pointless entertainment, not merely relying on the essentials. Nobody in power is benefiting from a sick and withdrawn population when the potential cure is unlikely to be sold at a profit.</p>
<p>So who exactly are you worried about "taking control" here? Who is benefiting from an economy where nobody is buying anything, people aren't doing anything, and the problem can't be fixed at a profit? I know it's disconcerting to see people in masks, but how exactly does that give someone the ability to control you?</p>

        <p>Its like you have a very shallow grasp on whats actually going on. Tech companies have turned ridiculous profits from this whole event. This has accelerated automation and the surveillance state quite significantly. Don't act like there's no control factor here. People are so hung up on masks, but the entire event is more than just masks. This is about fear based propaganda and getting people to blindly shill for the introduction of more forced health-care mandates and basing your freedom off of your medical  status.</p>

        <p>See the pictures of "nobody buying anything" and "nobody doing anything" are not true to reality. Most of us working class ppl in the US have been buying and working, but a lot of that buying and working is very much helping ppl like Amazon, Google, Microsoft etc. due to all of the restrictions</p>

        <p>I didn‚Äôt say anything about controlling me. I suspect that you‚Äôre projecting onto me a stereotypical conspiracy theorist, which is what mask critics are, in the popular imagination. I am not that person, sorry. There have been plenty of articulate, nuanced, non-conspiracy explanations in this sub of the political and cultural purposes of masks, and I don‚Äôt have time to rewrite them rn.</p>
