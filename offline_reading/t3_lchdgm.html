    <strong>Collective Passive Resistance - Ruminations on how to (legally!) make our overlords regret their dystopia</strong>
    <p><p>With all the talk of prolonged or eternal face-diapering, even with a "vaccine" (you know, the <em>one thing</em> that our overlords said at the outset was <em>supposed</em> to bring and end to all of this insanity), things are looking pretty grim. </p>
<p>But the recent WallStreetBets/GME saga left me with a bit of inspiration. They demonstrated that collective action can deliver a giant metaphorical nut-punch to the ruling class. </p>
<p>They have opened up the world a little tiny bit and are hoping you'll play along and be appeased because you were given a pathetic little scrap of freedom back with 25% restaurant capacity (but still the mask theater). <em>Don't fall for it.</em> We need to take a hard, firm stand: until the face panties go away, and are repudiated completely, our mission should be to undermine the globalist economy at every turn and make this start backfiring on them <em>big time</em>. </p>
<p>The following is my short list of ideas for doing exactly that, at least in the USA (Europe and Canada are probably porked, outside of Sweden... sorry Europe and Canada).</p>
<p>. . . . . </p>
<p>- <strong>Do not</strong> use the airlines, bus companies, or anything else with the federal mask mandate. Drive a thousand miles for your vacation if you have to (easy in tandem, I've done 500 miles by myself two dozen times, and 700+ miles twice with a co-pilot). Don't have a car? Bike through the city, even in a frigid December (I know a guy who does this in the Northeast, so it is clearly possible). Boycott Face Diaper Airlines/Bus Lines/etc., loudly and publicly, and let your representatives know you WILL NOT be setting foot on them, ever again, until the mandates go away. Not even if the plane tickets are $1. </p>
<p>- The big one: avoid paying giant corporations whenever you can. Amazon, Netflix, all of those... cancel them. Don't give them another penny. There will be stuff you can't really avoid: internet access, cell phone, and groceries. But otherwise, if it's a mega-corporation and the mask sign is up... <em>just don't go.</em> Not to the movies, not to Dave and Buster's, not to anything. Get off of Twitter, FB, etc. unless it is ONLY in anti-statist groups (and switch to elsewhere when possible). WSB showed us that you fight the bastards by hitting them in the wallet. They'll probably respond by rigging the game -- but that should hopefully only expose the corruption to more people. </p>
<p>- The corollary: try to support small businesses wherever and whenever you can. Mrs. AccountingTroll and I are almost exclusively eating at independent local restaurants. Don't get your quick meals from BK/McD's -- go to the local independent sub/pizza shop. The latter has way better food anyway. Groceries and supplies are hard, but there should still be a few small firms left for specialty items. Support them. Don't feed the Target/Wal-Mart/Amazon beast. </p>
<p>- If you can, take up outdoor, unmasked hobbies -- especially ones that don't contribute much to corporate profits. Hiking and laying on the public beach are two great things that don't require much up-front expense (intense hiking has a little, but going 10 miles into the wilderness with no mask police is absolute heaven). They're public land, so you just need your basic supplies, gas money, and yourself. The idea is to send a message that <strong>we will not participate</strong> in masked hobbies/activities. <em>Make the masking unprofitable for them.</em> </p>
<p>- The hardest one: start finding a way to gather like-minded, local individuals, privately, to do things that don't cost a lot of money (card/board games are good, a lot of fun for a small cost, if you like that sort of thing). Meet regularly, outside the auspices of corporatist state spaces. I saw someone post about the FreedomCells site here a while back, but unfortunately I was literally the only person who had signed up in my state at the time, and I don't know how trustworthy it is. Blue region sucks. Closest groups are 45 minutes and 2+ hours away, and would require violating the interstate travel ban -- which I'm seriously considering at this point as an act of civil disobedience. Especially since there is a neighboring state with fewer restrictions, and those travel bans seem blatantly unconstitutional. </p>
<p>- If you have a small business or product, <strong>do not sell out</strong> to the big guys. Hold your ground no matter what. The more small stuff we have, the better equipped we are in this fight. There's not much point in getting low-end rich in a shut-down, muzzled world. </p>
<p>- Get the hell out of the blue states if you can, then vote red (Republican, not communist!) or at least vote gold (libertarian), and especially no RINOs. The more contrasting states we have like FL and SD, the better. It's going to be a while for me before I can change jobs again (changed in mid-2020), and I hate FL (way too hot and no real hiking), but if the face diapers do not go away by sometime this summer, I am seriously considering abandoning the only part of the country I have ever lived in. There is a lot of regional stuff here that I will truly miss, but other than hiking, it's all basically gone anyway.  </p>
<p>. . . . . </p>
<p>I welcome other ideas to expand on this, but the people doing maskless civil disobedience does not have a financial impact, at all. The concept I have is simple: hit the companies in their wallets, and make people remember the corrupt Xiden Administration as the absolute <em>worst</em> American economy in their lifetime. </p>
<p>They squeezed the hedge funds. Now it's time to squeeze the rest of them! But it is going to take the same kind of hard work and commitment that all of those fanatical "diamond hands" people have over on the WallStreetBets sub. It's likely to be a long, drawn-out fight... but at least it doesn't enrich the people muzzling you, and it circumvents the government mandated misery as much as possible.</p></p>
