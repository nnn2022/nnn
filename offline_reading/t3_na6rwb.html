    <strong>How serious is vaccine shedding?</strong>
    <p><p>I just got my hair done by a lady who’s had both jabs. I’m 22F and I’m really scared. I have my whole life ahead of me, I have goals and dreams and I don’t want to die young. This vaccine shedding thing has been eating me alive and making so anxious that I’ve been making myself sick and losing sleep over it. Is it possible to second handedly get vaccinated? These spike proteins shedding is really scaring me. I’m scared that I’m now vaccinated without even physically having a noodle go in my arm. Please tell me I’m just overthinking it and paranoid, I really can’t do this. I feel like crying. </p>
<p>I also feel like a doomer but in reverse because I wore not one, but TWO masks because I’m that terrified of vaccine shedding. Ladies who go to salons, you know the stylists are all over you, in your face, touching your head and face a lot. Yeah I’m freaking out big time.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly, you sound like you have bad anxiety about this pandemic that is getting out of control.  I'm sure you're fine from going to the hair salon.  You can't get a second-hand vaccination.  </p>
<p>Don't let this stuff get into your head. If you don't feel sick you're fine.  And if you feel like your stress is getting out of control consider that it might be depression or anxiety that you could work on separately from the pandemic.  Good luck.</p>

        <p>I know but I’m telling you as an objective observer that this is getting to you more than it should. </p>
<p>You said it was “eating you alive” which to me sounds like unhealthy levels of anxiety. I’ve been there myself.  Think about talking to someone. You shouldn’t have to suffer like this.</p>

        <p>I think it's reasonable to not have sex with or date someone who has gotten the shot(s). But I don't think it's reasonable to try to completely avoid people who have gotten it. It's now approximately 50% of the adult population. We can't live our lives in fear. That's what the doomers have done. We're better than that.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't worry about it, I'm living with someone who got both Moderna shots and have not experienced any of the "shedding" symptoms people talk about. Personally, though I'm open-minded about it, I'm a bit skeptical of the whole thing.</p>

        <p>What we did with covid? We accepted inevitable consequences so life can somewhat be still enjoyable and managable. This is how it's gonna be too. Take vitamins and minerals - vitamin D3, zinc, quercetin, magnesium. Look into NAC. FDA is hastily pulling it off market, so search what's remaining on Amazon. If you're European, I saw it was selling on Ebay. My father is vaccinating next week, so I'm on array of vitamins lol If my uterus falls off of me, oh well, what are my options? I did everything to protect myself &amp; I did everything else right in my life, so I don't see why I would deserve such fate. But what is inevitable is inevitable.</p>

        <p>I don't want to add to your anxiety, but I wanted to share <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/self-spreading-vaccines-self-amplifying-mrna-vaccines-covid-vaccine-menstrual-disruption/"><strong>this video</strong></a> with you. It's a long vlogcast, but it was very informative for me. The title of the video is "Self-Spreading Vaccines, Self-Amplifying MRNA Vaccines &amp; COVID Vaccine Menstrual Disruption". I would recommend watching it while cooking or doing the laundry or when you have some quiet time to yourself. Not many people want to watch a long 2 hour video blog cast (vlogcast), but I find Ryan's work fascinating, and he cites all of his sources. </p>
<p>In my honest opinion, I think because you're young and haven't had the shot, then maybe the shedding thing won't affect you. It's not like she was sweating profusely over your face, nor was she breathing straight into your mouth, but if it was something like contact sports or if she wasn't wearing a mask or gloves, okay, that would be a different story. In any case, I've been in contact with those who've had one or both jabs, and I've refused to take the shot, so I'm worried too, but I can't hide or avoid my neighbours or friends forever, so I'm hoping that you and I are okay from this possible shedding. Let's pray and hope for the best. Take care friend.</p>

        <p>I'm not concerned about that kind of possible light exposure to spike proteins, which is all that would transmit, not the "code" to generate it. If exposure turns out to be a problem it would be dose-dependent (and not dangerous at low levels, else it would be dangerous to the elites too). Living with someone and breathing in the same room as them for hours a day every day is very different from being near someone for 20-30 minutes once.</p>

        <p>I doubt a few shed spike proteins are going to harm you in any meaningful way. It's the people injecting themselves with the mRNA vaccine turning their cells into spike protein factories that should really worry. If they are in fact shedding spike proteins, you may gain just a little bit of extra immunity.</p>

        <p>I don't trust anything to do with the Vaccinations.</p>
<p>But just like there are many that have no issues with it and some who do have blood clots etc. </p>
<p>I think if shedding is happening it easily may be from a minority. Mind you, If it exists it's still a crapshoot...</p>

        <p>If you wore a mask and she had a mask and gloves on,  you probably are alright.  I am worried about the shedding too, but from what I have read it comes through the skin and respiratory system. I am around medical people who wear gloves and are doubly masked and nothing has happened to me.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that. Did she touch you skin on skin contact? Maybe if she just touched the hair you will be okay. I would go wash my hair.</p>

        <p>for me the issue is undecided. I don't know. I don't think a hair dresser's contact would be enough to hurt her even if the shedding is real.</p>
