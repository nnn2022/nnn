    <strong>Will we ever get out of this hell</strong>
    <p><p>I apologize in advance for doomerposting, I've seen a lot of activism out in the world lately and that's very good. However, I haven't seen things getting better, only worse. I was so excited when the US finally dropped all our mandates and fully reopened, and now it seems like the whole thing is going to last all of 2 more months before we go back under lockdown/mask mandates/vaccine requirements. I don't give a shit about the new variants. I know as well as the rest of you that they will just keep coming up with new ones every year in perpetuity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having the freedoms and privileges I'm entitled to as a free citizen back in full force for such a short time, only to see the plan being executed to revert it all back to square one is depressing the shit out of me. Even then, with the nonstop media whining about the DeLTa VaRiaNt and the constant vaccine propaganda, we still have it better here than anywhere else in the West. How long before its our turn to go full Auth mode and become like France or Australia? People are protesting and have been this whole time, but nothing has changed. Is there nowhere in the world to actually be free? I wish I could just be trapped on an island somewhere away from society. I truly fucking hate it here. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the complaining, I am just so tired and angry.</p></p>

        <p>I honestly can’t believe we are still here…I have been working from home since March of last year and I am just about to return to work here in a couple weeks. I really was trying to be optimistic last year about having everything under control by early to mid 2021 and WOW was I wrong. The thoughts of pre-2020 life seem so foreign and so far away. Pre-2020 vs where we are right now in this moment is something I try to dissect and digest every single day and 100% of my body and my mind rejects it…it’s not natural and not right. We are witnessing the most aggressive and collective violation of humanity worldwide on many different levels and it’s really hard and disheartening to watch. Watching what’s happening to our brothers and sisters in the UK and France and other countries throughout the world right now is so disgusting and infuriating. In a world where the governments and elites try to drive more and more division into society we all must remember that no matter what; WE the people, of all nations and tongues - we MUST stand strong for our beliefs and for our rights to be human and to have choice on how we live. Stay strong and never forget that even though it may seem that you are alone in all of this - your not.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it looks like the theater is here to stay for a „while“.</p>
<p>I try to focus on the stuff•activities that haven‘t been restricted by big brother yet.</p>
<p>It sucks that things like traveling abroad are still pretty much impossible. But feeling miserable doesn’t really do much.</p>
<p>Last but not least, staying true to my principles and being honest about it to my friends and family is a big source of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Don’t fake anything to get any favors/pity from the government.</p>

        <p>I feel this way too. Our lives as we know it are changing very rapidly, and I’m not sure why some people think the vaccines are going to be “the way out”, they seem more like the way into a dystopian hell hole. </p>
<p>It does get very exhausting to deal with. Living in the sticks is beginning to sound like the move the longer this crap escalates. They should just let us have our own half of the country.</p>

        <p>We have already seen that they are not. People essentially got the summer off…and now it’s new variants, back to restrictions, and now passports happening in some countries and on the horizon for others.</p>

        <p>At some point we'll all be the same since we are now under a NWO authoritarian beast system. They're just trying to make it appear that countries still have autonomy. They don't. Things will not get better so there's no point to anyone complying with the tyrants but people still trust them for some reason.</p>

        <p>This makes me happier than I already am I'm never getting vaxxed. I can't imagine having a false sense of freedom only to have it swept out from under my feet. I just enjoyed being unmasked and unvaxxed. I didn't pretend it was impossible to do both at the same time and I'm glad because now the mandates are returning and it's very clearly been fucking pointless.</p>
