    <strong>In-person schools and cases</strong>
    <p><p>I am curious how schools in your area are handling the situation when cases are found among students/staff.  Who is made to quarantine?  How many cases does it take to shut down a school?  Please tell me what country you are in, and, if in the USA, what state.</p>
<p>I'm asking because larger schools are going virtual right and left around me since cases are rising (it's fall, duh)! in New Jersey.  Of course, our rules are insane.  Schools HAVE to close (regardless of size) if two unlinked cases are found in the school.  That means my son's 40 person preschool is under the same restrictions as a 3000 person high school (yes, you read that right).</p>
<p>Even then, schools can close for even 1 one case if they feel like it (it isn't mandatory but some superintendents pee themselves if anyone tests positive).  Also, anyone who is in "close contact" with the infected person has to quarantine for 14 days.</p>
<p>Of course, almost no one is actually getting the virus in school and from what I hear, virtually no one who quarantines tests positive or shows symptoms (if they choose not to test).</p>
<p>This is all so insane and is making school a disaster.</p></p>

        <p>I am a teacher... the rules I’m seeing in my environment (MA) are a lot of security theater (one way hallways... two way stair cases... lunch everyone sits together with a sad teacher telling them to space out...and don’t get me stared on “instrument masks”). We have had about 5 cases in the district... unsure of who quarantines because kids will just be magically remote. However, the guidelines are if you are in 6 feet of a person for more than 15 minutes (currently) you quarantine or get a test. We are “synchronous hybrid” which is a code word for living Hell for all involved. I want them all back...</p>

        <p>From Metro News:</p>
<p>“Statistics from the Department of Education show approximately 26% of state-funded schools had one or more pupils self-isolating on October 22, compared to 21% the week before. This equates to 55% of secondaries and 20% of primaries.</p>
<p>Attendance in schools has fallen across the board in the past week, with approximately 86% of pupils in state-funded schools in attendance on October 22.”</p>
<p>Yeah “no ones getting the virus” suuuure</p>
<p>Once it gets into schools it pretty much spreads like wildfire. Thankfully there are systems in place separating year groups to stop the spread as much as possible.</p>

        <p>Is this in the UK?  Just curious.
Self-isolating doesn't mean they are sick.  As I commented in my post, sometimes they will quarantine an entire class for 1 positive and no one else actually gets it.  Just because kids are in school doesn't mean they are ill.
Spain even noted that there wasn't any relation between virus levels in their community and opening schools.  https://www.npr.org/2020/10/21/925794511/were-the-risks-of-reopening-schools-exaggerated</p>
