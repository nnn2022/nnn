    <strong>This Malcolm X quote! üëáüëáüëá</strong>
    <p><p>"If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing."
Malcolm X</p>
<p>This couldn't be more fitting for what we're witnessing at the moment. It really hits home. </p>
<p>I was also reading the Wikipedia definition of a libertarian and noticed that the hard left in the west have become the complete opposite of what they're supposed to be.</p></p>

        <p>‚Äúthe history of the white liberal has been nothing but a series of trickery designed to make Negros think that the white liberal was going to solve our problems. Our problems will never be solved by the white man. The only way that our problem will be solved is when the black man wakes up, clean himself up, stand on his own feet and stop begging the white man, and take immediate steps to do for ourselves the things that we have been waiting on the white man to do for us. </p>
<p>Once we do for self then we will be able to solve our own problems‚Äô "The white conservatives aren't friends of the Negro either, but they at least don't try to hide it. They are like wolves; they show their teeth in a snarl that keeps the Negro always aware of where he stands with them. But the white liberals are foxes, who also show their teeth to the Negro but pretend that they are smiling. 
The white liberals are more dangerous than the conservatives; they lure the Negro, and as the Negro runs from the growling wolf, he flees into the open jaws of the "smiling" fox. One is the wolf, the other is a fox. No matter what, they‚Äôll both eat you.‚Äù</p>
