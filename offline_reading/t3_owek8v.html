        <p>Yes, I had it. Woke up Christmas Eve morning and I couldn’t smell or taste my coffee. Once I noticed that, other symptoms from the days prior lined up.(but were so small I blamed them in other things) I tested positive twice within 8 days. My smell is a little messed up still, some things just don’t smell right still. Other then that, it was like a normal cold.
Edit wow I got banned from three sub Reddit’s two seconds after replying to this question!</p>

        <p>I had a similar thing to you but only like a month or so ago, was out of work for 3 days and wrh the rest of isolation. Although my taste and smell have both fully recovered luckily. 
Also enjoy your bans, literally a lot of reddit don't like people having an honest discussion. I got banned from a subreddit i've never even commented on!</p>

        <p>I had at April last year. My wife who was pregnant at the time and my two babies also had it. My sons had near sniffles and the most traumatic parts about their covid experience was me trying to wipe their noses.</p>
<p>My wife couldn't really differentiate between her covid symptoms and her pregnancy symptoms. Pregnancy causes enhanced sensitivity to smells and covid reduces it so it kind of evened out. She was already tired and she was already having digestive problems and she already felt like crap because she was pregnant that the covid didn't really do anything special to her. </p>
<p>I had a much different experience. I had it really bad. In the evenings I had hyperthermia but in the mornings I would wake up with little hypothermia. The spike proteins caused my blood to clots and we're attacking my kidneys and my testicles. I was nauseous and didn't really eat for close to a month. My knees and hips still ache to this day. As I write this my left knee is just aching like crazy. </p>
<p>If this is what I had to do to get natural immunity that would protect me in the future then I'm glad that I did it. The vaccine honestly scares me to death.</p>
<p>Edit. I am a healthy man in my mid thirties with no co-morbidities. I am relatively fit as my job as a an welder/iron worker requires it. I don't smoke and never have but again being a welder I do breathe in some shit from time to time.</p>

        <p>Thank you I appreciate that. I'm fully recovered as much as one really can be from a virus that enters your body like Miley Cyrus on a wrecking ball. </p>
<p>I think there is a lot of random chance with getting sick with the SARS-COV-2 virus. It seems to be either random chance of how you get sick or maybe it's genetic but there's definitely a covid lottery that you can win or lose. 
The vast differences in how it affects some people so seriously or so casually is incredible but also in the different ways it attacks people. In some people it goes for their brain and their spine and in others their kidneys and reproductive organs. Some people have their cardiovascular system as well as their blood vessels attacked, it is just a crap shoot of what could happen to you and it might come down to dumb luck.</p>

        <p>Thanks for posting this. I think a lot of people, particularly on this sub, get lost in the false dichotomy of covid having two distinct outcomes; death or perfectly fine. Lots of people survive covid but share your story</p>

        <p>It was genuinely the worst illness I've ever had. It was the combination of severe illness but the confusing nature of all of it. I have never before experienced going to bed with a fever approaching 105 and waking up with a temperature of 92. I have never experienced having my testicles attacked by a virus shutting off my testosterone. I didn't have the ability to smell or taste and I couldn't breathe very well despite my lungs being in pristine condition. When I went into hospital the doctors did their tests on my lungs and they said your lungs are pristine but because the virus was attacking my kidneys there was some fluid around my lungs or something. </p>
<p>The big takeaway from this experience for me was that it was all very weird. I have had all kinds of illnesses including the Spanish flu of 2009 but this one was just so different and weird. Often when you get sick the conditions of the virus makes sense as they are in some way connected. A fever and a headache makes sense because they are connected. Not being able to smell or taste, having trouble breathing, clotting blood, and having your balls shut off is a very unconnected set of complications of a virus.</p>

        <p>Super sorry to hear how bad it was, but at least you survived (which, if you have kids, is all that matters to them). Unfortunately viruses can be extremely unpredictable due to their systemic nature. Like you, I’m healthy (as far as I know) but I’m in my early 40s and afraid of having even a moderate case of covid. Hope your joint pain resolves and best wishes.</p>

<p>3 different schools, a job that requires daily public transport and dealing with the general public. Family who have travelled to different parts of the UK, sometimes by public transport.

        <p>I worked supply in my school board this last year as an EA for 4 months before I settled into one school full time.  For the supply I was in a different school everyday spending 1 on 1 time with maskless kids all day.  The full time gig was in a kindergarten class with maskless kids that didn't cover their mouths when they sneeze or cough, pick their noses and then want to hold your hand, or sit on your lap.  I would purposely not wash my hands before lunch to expose myself to their germs.  Why?  Because of a study I read about the elderly who were exposed to little kids frequently and how they have a much more robust immune system then their peers who don't spend time with kids.  My (mandatory) mask was cloth and a single layer because I cut the other layer out.  It had massive gaps above my nose and was always falling down.  I also had a tea or coffee with me so I "had" to pull the mask down constantly to drink.  I didn't get covid.  I'm youngish, fit, with no co-morbities.</p>

        <p>I likely had it. Dulled (but not lost) taste/smell, runny nose, slight sore throat, cough, lasted a couple days.</p>
<p>Every spring and periodically throughout the summer I get bad seasonal allergy flare-ups that lead to mild bronchitis and asthma attacks. Feels identical to that, to the point if it weren't for the smell thing I'd write it off as allergies or a mild seasonal flu.</p>
<p>I'm 23, very fit, but also asthmatic and I smoke.</p>

        <p>I mean I'm still alive and still had a day of heavy lifting/exercise while I had it so...</p>
<p>No. If I were morbidly obese or elderly I could see it being a problem, but for someone like me it's a cakewalk (relatively speaking). Didn't even have an inhaler on hand while I had it and I was fine. It's no worse than influenza.</p>

        <p>I got covid last fall.  Headache, loss of taste and smell, mild fatigue, mild brain fog.  It lasted a week.  If I had never heard of covid, I wouldn't have even considered myself fully sick.  Mire like a mild flu with a few odd symptoms.  Still worked out every day and functioned fine.  I just got bored quarentining.  Lost my job because of my quarentine so I went from a graphic designer to pizza delivery, but now Im finishing up EMT school so it all worked out.  Im just saying the worst part if getting the virus was losing my job.  I was days away from homelessness and defaulted on my student loans.  Ruined my credit.  A government mandated vaccine is an act of war IMO.</p>

        <p>I am from India. My whole family had covid at the end of  may. My dad,myself,brothers wife had no symptoms. My sister lost only smell. My brother is overweight (above 120kg)  suffered a lot his oxygen levels dropped to 85. only government covid care center had oxygen at the time so we admit him there. Because he can't take care of himself I stayed with him for 7 day's in the center with 400+ another covid patients at the same room. After 7 days he recovered and doctor advised him to lose weight.</p>

        <p>Yes. It took two days to get over. 30 and healthy. Smell is slightly off wack months later, with certain smells. The more you smell something the more it comes back.</p>

        <p>I had it in january. The days I was sick werent bad. 2 days total. 2 weeks home was boring as hell. The only lasting effects I notice is certain air fresheners just absolutely wreak of chemicals and I cant enjoy them anymore. But food smells and tastes the same even after losing smell for about 4-5 days.</p>

        <p>Never got tested, but I am assuming we had it at the house because my wife lost her sense of smell and taste for a few weeks. She had a bad cough for the first couple days of that. Nothing other than that and back to normal after 2 weeks. </p>
<p>We didn’t change our behavior at all, neither the kids or I had any symptoms during that time.</p>

        <p>My husband had it a year ago, he was 40. He coughed for about a week. There was a day and a half or so where it hit its peak, and for him that meant sleeping on the couch most of the day. He had some dizziness and, if I remember correctly, a headache. Slight fever but nothing crazy.</p>
<p>My son has it currently. He tested positive last Thursday. (He's 11). He had a few days in a row of headache and congestion. Then on Thursday he also said he felt dizzy, so I felt like, "OK, I don't wanna eff around with dizziness", so I took him in. They tested him as a precaution and voila, it was positive. He felt better by Friday (literally the next day), today's Monday and he's fine.</p>

        <p>My parents who are in their late 50s and quite healthy had it. My mom had zero symptoms except her taste and smell were gone for about a month. My dad felt like he had the flu for about 2-3 days then back to normal. </p>
<p>My husband’s grandmother had it. She’s 88, in very rocky health and has cancer. She said she couldn’t smell anything and was extra tired. She fully recovered.  </p>
<p>A co-worker of mine who is in his early 60s, obese and has diabetes had it. He was home sick for 10 days. He felt like crap and had body aches pretty bad. Not hospitalized and fully recovered. </p>
<p>Another co-worker in his mid-thirties had it. He got very sick and was hospitalized for 1-2 days. Fully recovered now. He doesn’t have any weird underlying conditions or anything. Just luck of the draw I guess (or maybe a little karma? Lol kinda jk).</p>

        <p>Not to my knowledge.  But my 65 year old mom and 84 year old step father had it.  Starting taking zinc immediately, and they were back to walking in the evenings on the daily, within a week.  Both are relatively healthy, though he runs high blood sugar at times, and she’s got some minor knee and hip issues.</p>

        <p>Never tested for it, so I can't say I had it, although with the faulty tests, who knows if I had it?</p>
<p>That said, March last year, I became super sick and super exhausted. Like, so exhausted, I couldn't play videogames, and I usually try to play videogames in all my free time. I think I had it then, but I will never know.</p>

        <p>I’m fairly certain I had it back in March 2020, but they weren’t testing then unless you were in the hospital. I flew back right when they were shutting down Europe and making people come home in droves, and of course had a connection in Atlanta. </p>
<p>Anyway, I was sick for about two weeks, but I’ve felt sicker from other illnesses in the past. I was working from home and only fully called out about 1 day due to the 1 day I had a fever. Oh, and no long term issues.</p>

        <p>My whole family had it (parents, brother, sister, wife, and daughter). Wasn’t bad for us. Basically we were all really tired but that was about it. My mom lost her smell and my wife had a 1-2 day period that was bad with aches/chills but she is immune compromised. All in all it seemed to affect people a bit different but we are all pretty healthy (I.e. not overweight). Also for reference parents are in their late 50s. Wife and I are 30, and my siblings are late 20s. Hope that helps!</p>

        <p>I had it back in january, it was a regular cold with a being sleep for a day or so. I just recently got it again tho and this time is way worse. Way more tired, trouble digesting food, meaning  cant really eat for the past two days, keep getting bad heartburn and nasuea, light cough. I think this is the delta, wifey got it to and my parents same types of symptoms although they got hit harder because i guess they didnt get it this year yet like me. I think this is the delta variant tbh, it resembles a bad cold with flu like symptoms. Its not the worse flu I have ever gotten but its up there with the worst illnesses for sure. male/early 30's/above average fitness/bodybuilder no drugs etc/eat healthy</p>

        <p>I'm recovering from <em>probably covid</em>. My sister nabbed a quick test from work and I tried to swipe it up my nose. The test was just barely positive.</p>
<p>It started out as being lightheaded. Then my body hurt a bit. A couple days later it hit. I was sleepy and tired, but I have difficulty sleeping at normal hours and sleeping more than 8 hours, so after the second day my sleep schedule was shot. Not much appetite. After three days of being in the shit, I had a rough throat, but was over the hump. That was 4 days ago. My sleep schedule is still shot, but that's already normal for me. Haven't got my appetite back quite yet. The worst of it is that I'm still a bit lightheaded.</p>
<p>Overall, I'd say there were three times in my life that I've been more sick. I went to the hospital with the flu once when I was in high school. This wasn't even close in severity, although it did last longer. There was another time that I had the flu that lasted longer than this, and was about the same in severity.</p>
<p>I'm 42. About 20 pounds overweight. Not in great health, but not sickly. I likely caught it from my sister, who is vaccinated, who also gave it to my father who is vaccinated (and a 72yo overweight stroke survivor). She most likely caught it at work from a guest who was also vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Never got a positive test. But last year my husband and I had brain fog and a grey colored complexion. We recovered in a few days. I made a hefty batch of caldo de res for us on day 1 which i believe helped immensely.</p>

        <p>I had Covid in June of last year. I’m 41 and healthy. It felt like the flu but with a bad headache. I took Advil and worked from bed and was fine. It took about a week to recover. Body aches, headache, fatigue, and loss of smell for two days. I have been 10 times sicker from the flu in the past.</p>

        <p>Yes although I didn't know it for a week. Went to work the Monday and Tuesday not feeling well knowing something was off, was ok ish on Wed-Thur and woke up on the Saturday with a persistent headache and no taste and smell. I was just really tired feeling throughout it. Oh, and my appetite hasn't fully come back either</p>

        <p>I had it. Felt a bit crappy at work, managers told me to stay home and get a covid test. The testing centre was a clown show, I had to do it myself while the nurse gave me instructions from 10 meters distance. I had a positive result and was told to stay 10 days in self isolation , was feeling typical flu symptoms for 5 days. On the 6th day I was happily squatting at the gym.</p>
