    <strong>Do People See These Changes In The World and Think Things Will Go Back To Normal?</strong>
    <p><p>Too many of us are distracted by our egos, politics, and social media, to see the big things changing right in front of us.</p>
<ul>
<li>City wide curfews</li>
<li>Increasing censorship</li>
<li>Increasing elimination of privacy</li>
<li>Control of information and science</li>
<li>Neighbors and family snitching on each other</li>
<li>Police raiding homes for having family over</li>
<li>Encroaching technocratic power</li>
<li>Travel bans and border closures</li>
<li>Increase in power and wealth for billionaires</li>
<li>Violation of rights and freedom</li>
<li>Increased hostility and division</li>
<li>Increase tension in global politics</li>
<li>Mass psychological conditioning</li>
</ul>
<p>Things slowly build up until you're living in a completely different world only 1 year later. it.</p>

        <p>Technology really has been the driver of the complacency though. As someone who has grown up loving tech, I've seen the amazing benefits of the internet but the ugliness it can bring is showing more and more.</p>
<p>Entertainment, socialization, education, income, delivery, can all be done by the internet. </p>
<p>This is why I think most people do not question stay at home orders. Many people's daily lives have gone unchanged or improved from staying home. </p>
<p>Some people think it's just about masks because that's been the only obvious change in their life.</p>

        <p>But this has been on the cards for 20 years, maybe more. This is just a catalyst. If we had been training a strong independent population to be curious, resilient and  the scientific method. It's not only just one year.</p>

        <p>This being a catalyst  is exactly my point. The most dramatic of changes has happened in only one year and the majority are complacent to it.  That's what's alarming to me. </p>
<p>I don't blame people for not noticing gradual negative change. This abrupt change to our lives doesn't even raise concern or questioning for the majority of people. That's a sign most people will never see the light or exit the cave.</p>

        <p>exactly this is what shocked me to my core since march: the unquestioning compliance</p>
<p>i am in sort of a continuous state of shock not noticing a change in compliance</p>
<p>the news of large rates of european health professionals refusing to vaccinate however gives me a bit of hope</p>
<p>it was always clear that just consuming news and not caring about checkimg out opposing opinions made many people seem a bit "not caring". but the shock is to see how far the "not caring goes".
all one can do now/always is to challenge the views of loved ones by asking smart questions and make them realize something is off "by themselves"</p>
<p>its time and energy consuming</p>
<p>luckily i have time on my hands now</p>

        <p>It's more alarming and personal when it's people you know who are normally intelligent and skeptical. It makes me wonder if it's the social pressure of conformity or truly psychological manipulation. </p>
<p>At it's core people don't mind any of this if their everyday life isn't personally affected too much. If we have shelter, power, internet, money, water, and food then we can brush off anything that's happening around us.</p>

        <p>This is exactly the point. The working classes and those in precarious situations have been affected. The smug wfhers and furloughed-types have not yet felt the effects. In fact, many in the upper income brackets working for tech companies and especially those who have shares have seen their lives get better. The problem with the 'I'm alright jack' attitude is that it WILL affect them in the end. It will affect everyone. If the NHS goes under and can't be funded because the cash has run out and taxes have to rise extortionately, people will complain. There will be lots of kids from all classes who are psychologically damaged. There will be civil unrest. So it's just a matter of time. In terms of the unquestioning compliance, in the UK at this stage it's just lip service. People are not obeying the rules. Ok, some are but many aren't. And so many people are getting fed up. However, I am totally spooked by the conformity and lack of questioning. I am actually deeply saddened and also disgusted by many people's lack of critical thinking. I cannot respect or feel sympathy if people are calling for lockdowns yet disobeying the rules and also simultaneously complaining. There's a lot of bitterness out there and people are using it to get one over others as well. Status is a thing and if people can score easy points they will</p>

        <p>You raise good points.</p>
<p>I can't judge people too harshly who just want to carry on and live life. But I don't have an ounce of respect for anyone who is pro-lockdown anymore. They are cheering on the downfall of society and aren't even aware of it.</p>

        <p>So do you think the majority will be happy with these lockdowns in a year? I don't. By then more middle classes will have suffered layoffs, cash won't be as forthcoming and their kids will be mentally ill. Students will fall out of the market and we will have a 'lost generation'. People will beg for 'Something to be done'. At that stage things could get even worse. A strongman could emerge with the answers. I actually see no smooth way out of this but perhaps I'm wrong. I hope I am.</p>

        <p>They won't see that lockdowns were the cause of the suffering.The blame will always be shifted to their fellow citizen for not complying properly. </p>
<p>Even if blame is eventually on the government, no one will admit they assisted in making the world this way.</p>
<p>The truth of lockdowns causing more suffering than the virus is infront of our faces and most still deny that.</p>
<p>Things will inevitably get worse. It's frustrating people don't see that this is a significant time in history for people to reject control.</p>
<p>Like I said in another one of my comments; if people have all their basic needs met and they aren't inconvenienced too much they don't care about negative change.</p>

        <p>My point is they will be affected in the end. And it may not be that obvious...just slowly more misery then, suddenly, boom. I'm not convinced people will turn just on each other. They will also turn on politicians, SAGE, anyone who is linked to all this. Hilariously, the powers-that-be think the mob is under control. Well, it may be for now but it will turn. And I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it ended with targeted hatred against key people involved with lockdowns. It will inevitably get worse. If the Left gets in in the UK in four years it will be hell. Censorship for 'safety' if opinions go against the narrative, micro-management, more lockdowns for diseases/even climate and UBI for many - a pittance but enough to keep them compliant. There will be a few winners who will pay taxes to keep all this afloat. I'm looking to move away in the next four months, on and off out of the UK then permanently. Unless there's a sensible party in power and things start to seem more stable.</p>
