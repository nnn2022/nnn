    <strong>UK: stats from 14/March indicate that the virus is 2-3x more deadly than the vaccines for under 60s, but raises serious questions on whether under 60s should be locked down or take the vaccination at all</strong>
    <p><p>All of this information is verifiable on the UK government website and comes directly from the UK Public Health Agencies and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</p>
<p>Total number of vaccinations given:
Pfizer / BioNTech 10,900,000
Oxford University/ Astra Zeneca 13,700,000</p>
<p>Total number of reported 'yellow card events' (adverse effects suspected by the reporting individual to have come from the vaccination - anything from flu like symptoms, arm rash, bells palsy, anaphylaxis, blood clots, etc - thought to be severely under reported):
Pfizer / BioNTech 36,358 (0.334%)
Oxford University/ Astra Zeneca 77,178 (0.563%)</p>
<p>Total number of deaths reported which are believed to be from the vaccination (excluding 9 deaths with the vaccine type unspecified):
Pfizer / BioNTech 259 (0.00238%)
Oxford University/ Astra Zeneca 326 (0.00238%)</p>
<p>Total number of cases of COVID19 reported in the UK up to that date:
4,337,696 individual cases
125,000 deaths (2.88%)
Deaths under 60yo 574 (0.4592% total deaths)</p>
<p>A healthy under 60 getting a vaccine would have (roughly) a 0.9% chance of an adverse reaction, and a 0.002% chance of death, for a disease which only 6% of all people in the UK have had and, based on the deaths in under 60s, there's only 0.0054%  chance of contracting and dying from.</p>
<p>When you consider the unknown longterm side effects it becomes a fairly difficult to rationalise both lockdowns and having the vaccine at this point.</p></p>

        <p>I guarantee those stats are massively unreported because the people who've supported this whole scam are unlikely to want to say anything negative about it.</p>

        <p>Might want to double check your numbers.</p>
<p>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-reported-sars-cov-2-deaths-in-england/covid-19-confirmed-deaths-in-england-report</p>
<p>Says 4300 under 60 died in the period from July to the end of January just in England, not the whole UK.</p>
