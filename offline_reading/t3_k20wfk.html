        <p>The fact that it’s peer-reviewed and published doesn’t mean it shows what she claims. </p>
<p>To be clear, this study does not show that masks don't work. Neither does it show that they do.</p>
<p>From the paper:</p>
<p>“The most important limitation is the that the findings are inconclusive.”</p>
<p>“Yet, the findings were inconclusive and cannot definitively exclude a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection of mask wearers in such a setting.”</p>
<p>Limitations were:</p>
<p>“Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others.”</p>
<p>Because of the small sample size, the confidence interval of the results was huge and, based on this data, the effect of mask wearing could range from a 46% decrease in infection to a 23% increase in infection. That is very inconclusive.</p>
<p>All we can conclude is that in places where infection rates are generally low, and other protective measures are in place, this specific mask recommendation made during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with background rates of 2% PCR acquisition, failed to show that mask wearing reduces risk by 50%. It may have reduced risk by 46%. It may have increased risk by 23%. Or somewhere in between. We don’t know, because of the way the study was designed and the results they got.</p>
<p>A failure to show statistical difference is not evidence that there is no statistical difference, and the statistical analysis of the results on this study show that it is impossible to give a conclusive answer to the question of whether or not masks work.</p>
