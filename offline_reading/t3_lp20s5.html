        <p>The CDC has recently published an update on the estimated survival rates for COVID:</p>
<p>-99.997% for young people.</p>
<p>-99.98% for anyone under 50</p>
<p>-99.5% for anyone under 70</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html#table-1</p>
<p>That means once you are positive the fatality rate for 0-19 year olds is 1 out of 33,000</p>
<p>For 20-49 year olds it is 1 out of 5,000</p>
<p>For 50-69 year olds it's 1 out of 200</p>

        <p>Do you mean in community settings. Such as the current mandates for face coverings?</p>
<p>Follow the science</p>
<p>"To our knowledge, only 1 randomized controlled trial has been conducted to examine the efficacy of cloth masks in healthcare settings, and the results do not favor use of cloth masks."
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/10/20-0948_article?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app</p>
<p>Here is the study</p>
<p>A cluster randomised trial of cloth masks compared with medical masks in healthcare workers (2015)
http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25903751</p>
<p>Conclusions: This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.</p>

        <p>Turning droplets into aerosols. </p>
<p>That’s why RCT’s never show a lowering of viral transmissions </p>
<p>A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control. (Source). https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article
A Danish randomized controlled trial with 6000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting. (Source). https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817
A July 2020 review by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission. (Source). https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/
A May 2020 cross-country study by the University of East Anglia (preprint) found that a mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection. (Source). https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.20088260v1.full.pdf
An April 2020 review by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the University of Illinois concluded that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control). (Source). https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data
An article in the New England Journal of Medicine from May 2020 came to the conclusion that cloth face masks offer little to no protection in everyday life. (Source). https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372</p>

        <p>So if the danger is far because you're in a parking lot away from fast-moving traffic, that does make sense.  That's like not wearing a mask when you're far from other people. </p>
<p>But if the danger is near, like being in a car stopped on the side of a highway, with other traffic driving by, then it's wise and safe to wear a seatbelt.  Similarly, if you're walking through an area with others around, who can choose to come nearer to you and who are in numbers, meaning it's not even just one other person, but multiples, it's also wise and safe to wear a mask.  </p>
<hr>
<p>Furthermore, why so much focus on something that's a safety measure?  <strong>Is this subreddit's focus, spirit, and purpose to point out that bad things shouldn't be a new normal?  Where's the discernment between whether that means:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The pandemic should <em>not</em> be a new normal.  We should all take measures to mitigate and eradicate it so it becomes the past and not "normal." </p>
<p>or</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> The pandemic has killed hundreds of thousands of people, but we don't think <em>that</em> should be the focus of what shouldn't be the new normal.  Instead, we think responding safely to it should be our focus.  That way, it can be prolonged, we won't take precautions, and it will then become the new nor...  whaat?   Do we hear ourselves?  Let's rethink this...</p>
<p>I think we need to back up here a moment.. </p>
<p>It's not like these are boldly and clearly things that we should or should not do.  This is more a discussion topic in this thread about whether we're being one inch too safe when maaaybe it's ok to go that far?  That gray area over how safe is enough vs how safe is too safe... and it's not even a discussion focusing on that, it's just outright ridiculing it as if it's clearly waaay too much. </p>
<p>'Hmmm.. the CDC says we shouldn't drink poison.  It says even 1 mg per gallon of water is enough to kill us, and .01 mg per gallon can have harmful health effects over time, and that's for average sized-adults, so let's ban anything more than .001 mg per gallon.  But then let's have r/NoNewNormal argue that we will not have such a ridiculous ban.. .001 barely does anything!  Screw babies.. screw the elderly... if a healthy 18 year old can handle .005 mg, why are people being so ridiculous about .001 mg?  I mean, I just want to scream at how ridiculous that is!' /s</p>

        <p>That is not what it says.  Also, the top comment has math and logic errors and is an oversimplification that overlooks many factors and impacts. </p>
<p>Additionally, I am responding to someone suggesting that we don't need to and shouldn't wear masks to be safer, and not wearing masks causes this to spread more and spread more quickly, affecting more people, including and especially more vulnerable people, which includes older people and those who are more susceptible.  </p>
<p>Many of the statistics we have are among mask-wearing populations.  The numbers are different when people aren't properly wearing masks. </p>
<p>When people are infected and spread this, they do so regardless of when they are in public, mask-mandated places.  When Jack goes to the bar and doesn't wear a mask because he things, "what's the big deal?  I'm more likely to die in a traffic accident, so it doesn't matter," he is leaving off the words, "to me."  It doesn't matter <em>to him</em>.  </p>
<p>He'd be wrong, because it does matter to him.  It's still his risk.  </p>
<p>But there's more... </p>
<p>When people become infected, they also take it home and to relatives houses, where masks are much less more often worn.  </p>
<p>When you drive a car, risking accidents that can result in death, then you go home and hang out with your family, you are not spreading traffic fatalities to your other family members who can then spread it further, and directly to people more susceptible, including those who are older.  </p>
<p>So when Sam pulls into the driveway and chills on the couch with his Mom, he is not risking that she might die due to his driving. </p>
<p>So as you can see, there is a significant difference.  </p>

        <p>&rt; so what you're saying is the numbers straight from the CDC have logistical errors and are an overly simplistic. </p>
<p>Nope, /u/ScreenExtension's own interpretation and conclusions focus on <strong>part of the truth, but not the whole truth</strong>, <em>combined</em> with people's own conclusions drawn from that.  </p>
<p>&rt; Because it seems to me that's exactly what your saying.</p>
<p>Nope, that is not what I was saying. </p>
<p>The math is based on the logic</p>
<p>Remember when I followed that by saying <em>"Additionally, I am responding to someone suggesting that we don't need to and shouldn't wear masks to be safer"?</em>  </p>
<p>The word, "additionally" means that I'm responding to two things, not just one.  </p>
<p>Thing 1: The statistics about the numbers of people dying from Covid-19 who are younger than 55.  </p>
<p>...combined with...</p>
<p>Thing 2: People commenting about how silly it is to wear a mask in public if people <em>might</em> be more than 6 feet away, when we know it's safer to be both masked and distanced, as if the idea of something else being more dangerous suddenly makes COVID not dangerous at all. </p>
<p>Now look at the statement that /u/ScreenExtension made: </p>
<p>&rt; If you're under the age of 55, <strong>you're</strong> twice as likely to die from a traffic accident than COVID. Under the age of 45, the difference is 5 times higher for traffic accidents. </p>
<p>And herein lies the error from which people infer that "it doesn't matter."  </p>
<p>When people conclude that it isn't really as important as the CDC and all other scientists with this as their expertise state that wearing masks is important and essential to save lives, they are not just talking about your own life.  </p>
<p>If you catch it, you spread it to others, and many more older people die.  </p>
<p>Many more susceptible people die.  </p>
<p>You also increase your risk, but also those of strangers and your loved ones, including your own Mom, Dad, Grandparents, Uncles, and Aunts.  </p>
<p><em>Side-note: I'd guess that most of the traffic fatalities from people in vehicles are from people who are already wearing their seatbelts.  How much higher would they be if people weren't wearing seatbelts?  And how much higher would COVID deaths be if people weren't distancing </em>and<em> wearing masks?</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I'm not suggesting this is easy to grasp.  After all, people can easily lie with statistics, such as if you ask if the water is safe to swim in, and I say "well, no-one has died jumping into that water," and technically I am correct, because no-one has ever jumped into the water.  And then someone points out that my math and the logic it is based off of has errors.  </p>
<p>And someone replies saying, "What? Lol your first sentence....so what you're saying is the numbers straight from the CDC have logistical errors and are an overly simplistic. Because it seems to me that's exactly what your saying."  </p>
<p>And I say, "yeah, how can they lie?  The CDC lists statistics for this lake and has it listed at <em>zero</em> confirmed cases ever."  </p>
<p>Then you say, "well, we know this lake is full of poison.  And that in other lakes, anyone who swam in it absorbed it and died."  </p>
<p>And I say, "but you're still trying to say that the CDC is incorrect.  Idiot.  You think you know better than the CDC?" </p>
<p>And you say, "but this is ridiculous.  The lake is literally known to be full of poison.  This is important.  You are leading others to believe that it's safe to swim in.  People are responding to your statements by saying, <em>'yeah!  see how crazy that is?  Someone else told me I shouldn't swim in it even though the water looks completely clear!  These crazies and their mainstream-idolizing people make me want to pull my hair out!'</em>"  </p>
<p>You go on about how what I said is misleading, not the whole truth, only to have me respond.... </p>
<p>(Go on...)</p>
