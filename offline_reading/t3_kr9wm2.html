    <strong>Rapid Population Growth Starting in 1946 Led to "Most Deaths Ever in US" Today</strong>
    <p><p>The current headlines are terrifying: "US deaths in 2020 top 3 million, by far most ever counted" Scary, right?</p>
<p><a href="http://apnews.com/article/us-coronavirus-deaths-top-3-million-e2bc856b6ec45563b84ee2e87ae8d5e7">APNews</a> reports:</p>
<p>&rt;...preliminary numbers suggest that the United States is on track to see more than 3.2 million deaths this year, or at least 400,000 more than in 2019</p>
<p>But let's go back to 1946. What happened? Population growth in the US jumped from 1.46 million births to 2.73 million in a single year, and it didn't stop. <em>Year after year.</em> Some years had over <em>3 million</em> births: Baby boomers.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.demographia.com/db-uspop1900.htm">Population by year from 1900 to 1999</a></p>
<p>Let's think this out:</p>
<p>People born in 1946 are \~75 now. Average life expectancy in US is 78.6, and for that to be an average it means a lot of people below that age will die:</p>
<p>Many of the Baby Boomers worked in hazardous conditions (factories, mines, etc.) and ended up with emphysema, cancer, or other serious health conditions.  It was also common for that generation to smoke cigarettes constantly, eat unhealthy foods, and generally not take care of themselves. (Sedentary lifestyles in front of the TV, no exercise, etc.)</p>
<p>My point isn't to criticize them - it's to point out that many Baby Boomers won't reach the average life expectancy and we're seeing that in the death count now. That is to be expected.</p>
<p>At least some of these "MOST DEATHS EVER" (and possibly most of them) are a result of rapid US population growth that began in 1946.</p>
<p>The odds of dying have always increased with age, and since there are more old people now -- the total number of deaths per year is going to increase. <em>An explosion of population will naturally lead to an increase in deaths 70+ years later.</em></p>
<p>This shouldn't surprise people, but when the news terrifies us with headlines of "MOST DEATHS EVER" without putting population growth in context, then clearly the intent is to induce fear.</p>
<p>Why would they do that?</p>
<p>It's almost like there are people, governments, or corporations that stand to gain power or wealth by scaring us into accepting changes to our lives.  Changes we normally wouldn't accept if we weren't terrified...</p></p>

        <p>I’ve mentioned the baby boomer aspect to people on this topic so many times and it doesn’t click for them.  Good additional information to back up my argument.  Thanks.</p>

        <p>I don't understand why more people aren't thinking about it. The jump was huge -- and if you look from 1946, it just goes and goes for many years.</p>
<p>So the population is loaded with two decades of massive population growth. All the deaths from people who don't reach average life expectancy are going to add up.</p>

        <p>all the boomers are fated to die, not yet though... 'soon' over the next 20 years</p>
<p>the oldest boomers are 74 now, life expectancy in the usa is 78, iirc.</p>
<p>the average age of death with this fake ass covid is 82.</p>
<p>boomers are literally a 'crop' to the slaver cabal</p>

        <p>Its like they want me to be upset that a ton of people were born who lived full lives. Its like theyre saying, if less people are born, less people will die, and thats good cuz death is bad.</p>
