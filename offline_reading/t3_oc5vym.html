    <strong>Crisis conscience Self Realisation</strong>
    <p><p>I had to have a crisis talk with myself regarding my family on the topi of vaccinations.  I am 45, my parents are 70 +, my hubby is 67.
Parents want the Vax and have 2nd dose tomorrow cause it makes them feel better, hubby is on the fence and I think a bit worried about setting me off if he says he wants it.</p>
<p>My crisis has come from the realisation that all 3 who mean the world to me are in the last life stage now ... i refuse to have this myself for my own sanity, but now realise that the damage it does will not affect the quality of life my family have left ... so if it makes them feel.better, then go for it.<br>
Bitter pill to swallow ....</p></p>

        <p>I couldn’t agree more with you. Let them make their own choices (it’s what I’m doing) and love them through it. Don’t ruin your remaining time with them by worrying either. We are powerless as it’s their choice and we have to respect that (even if they don’t respect ours). Take the high road. I have unsubscribed from all the other anti/pro subs as the information isn’t good for the mental health. If I can’t do anything about it, it makes no sense worrying about it. </p>
<p>At the moment they’re not hold people down and injecting them so we still have a choice, albeit with consequences either way.</p>
<p>Don’t worry. In the very end, all will be well.</p>

        <p>You say it better than me, and yes I agree.  As much as it pains me (the pain being having to just roll with things and deal,  that's normal with my two parent/one child family dynamic sadly)I have been able to settle my mind with this now.  If they want it, it makes them feel better for allll the reasons, then I am ok with that as long as they do not push me.  So far, so good.<br>
Base fact, their life span left is likely less than the potential ramifications, so there is no harm.  </p>
<p>That said, it just sucks</p>

        <p>Posted this as a comment not long ago, but I would think I am not the only one in the situation, so new post it is.</p>
