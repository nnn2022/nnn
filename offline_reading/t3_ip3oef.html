    <p><p>Not one of us has gotten sick this whole time. Almost three full months, not one case. </p>
<p>Covid is not what they’ve led us to believe it is. It’s just a strain of flu.</p></p>

        <p>190k of coronavirus in the United States. 896k worldwide.</p>
<p>The misleading statistic of 9k deaths in the United States is counting all of the people who have died from the disease, but did not have any preexisting medical conditions.</p>
<p>The majority of deaths come from older folks, who have conditions like diabetes, limes disease, heart disease, etc..., hence the low count.</p>

        <p>It's NOT "a strain of flu". </p>
<p>Coronavirus and influenza viruses are different families of viruses. Past coronaviruses have been associated to the common cold.</p>
<p>The flu actually IS dangerous to the young and healthy, unlike this particular coronavirus.</p>
<p>We need to end this madness now and hold the criminals pushing it forward to account. It's still being pushed despite all the data.</p>

        <p>I never had the patience to wipe down every piece of equipment when I would work out even pre covid. Now it’s the rule but I still don’t even do that   I just always wash my hands at the gym   I never shower cause I live 5 minutes from my gym, I try avoiding the gym shower (but it did feel nice the few times I had to do it)</p>

        <p>That’s for sure and honestly people will take what they will and run with it, there’s still people spraying their groceries down.</p>
<p>I admit at its peak, when there were hundreds of articles a day saying anyone could catch it and die from it out of nowhere it rattled me, I did the hand sanitizing and hand washing, that maybe lasted a month tops, I’ve been to the grocery store a million times since then and never wash my hands, never sanitize them.</p>

        <p>Yep same. Not to mention before the mandatory mask bs nobody wore them in large numbers for months and nobody cared then all of a sudden it became "the thing" just because stores started virtue signaling and then came the social media ads about "Wear your mask and shut up". This entire thing is one big psyop. No data, no evidence, no proof, just compliance because the end goal is communism. And communism needs a population of poor weak people to take control of to work.</p>

I’ve been doing the same.  After the workout me and a bunch of the guys go out for drinks.<br>

<p>To your point, however - 1.35 million people die in car accidents every year. We should ban all vehicles, permanently. Covid’s 190,000 deaths is a drop in the bucket. If you’ve ever even sat in a car perfectly sober you are the real killer.</p>

        <p>I assumed from your original post that your critical thinking was a little faulty and might need a minor sarcastic response for you to see your logical fallacy.   Instead you doubled down and provide another example of poor reasoning.  </p>
<p>If you wish to Improve in this area, something we could all use, I recommend both “The Unpersuadables” by Will Storr or “Critical Thinking” by Scott Lovell.  </p>
<p>To your point about car accidents; first the 1.35 million figure you cite is GLOBAL deaths, then you cite only US deaths from Covid.  According to the NTSI the US averages around 36,500 traffic fatalities per year in the US.   I’ll use that so I’m comparing apples to apples.  </p>
<p>In the US the average yearly traffic accidents account for less than 20% of the number of COVID deaths (and that’s with only about half a year of deaths for COVID).  To mitigate the risk that comes with driving it is highly regulated by the state.  You have to earn and maintain a license as well as comply with the myriad of traffic regulations.  Otherwise you will take hefty fines or even jail time. </p>
<p>Citing something that is HEAVILY regulated but causes only 10-20% of the number of deaths attributed to COVID would logically dictate that similarly strict risk mitigation should be observed.  From your post you seem to imply that the risk mitigation of social distancing is not warranted because it hasn’t personally effected you or your small sample size.  Hence my comparison to drunk driving. Sure you could probably get home just fine after 5 beers; (and even do so quite often) but there is a statistically significant increase in the risks to yourself and others.   </p>
<p>Cool about the jiu jitsu though, seriously. Every person who’s decent at that gives me fits when sparring. Especially once they get me to the ground. Damn hard to defeat if done well.</p>

        <p>There is no logical fallacy here. Covid is on par with a bad flu. It is not an existential threat more so than anything else. More people die from falling in bathtubs. </p>
<p>Have you seen that deaths from heart disease are way way down? How do you explain that? Did we cure heart disease this year and no one thought to report on it? Or are people perhaps more inclined to blame a death on covid when there’s a positive covid test?</p>
<p>Of anyone who ever died anywhere, of any reason, do you think any of those people tested positive for something else? Someone with Hepatitis C surely died of a stroke. Someone with herpes died of cancer. Is everything all cooperatively responsible for everything now?  </p>
<p>Worldwide stat or not, we could save 1.35 million lives by banning cars. I guess you want to see drivers die! You sadist.</p>

<p>I'm going to give you the massive benefit of the doubt and label every single fall death in the US as having happened in a bathtub.  </p>
<p>Do you think that 13,322 is a larger number than 190,132?  </p>
<p>If I am incorrect can you cite a source for your murderous bathtub rampage theory?  I would love to be made aware of that if it is true, and not just something you saw on aunt Becky's facebook page.</p>
<p>And yes, I have seen that heart related deaths are down slightly.  It's rather easy to explain.  As one cause of death rises it is typical to see other rates fall.  For example, if an evil mastermind nuked several large US cities, you would see a decrease in heart attacks.  Why?  Because some of those people that stood a chance of dying later that year where instead killed in a nuclear blast.  Does that invalidate death by nuclear bomb?</p>
<p>Regardless of what people blame deaths on there has been a marked increase in the per capita number of death certificates being issued worldwide when compared to per capita numbers from 2000-2019.  [Link]( <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02497-w">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02497-w</a> ) What do you think is causing all these extra deaths? </p>
<p>You are correct that we could globally save 1.3 million people annually by banning cars.  But also remember that we take all the precautions I listed previously.  Licenses, tons of rules, fines, jail time, etc.  When making risk decisions one must weight the benefits against the costs, and implement a reasonable level of controls.  I don't think anyone is saying everyone should be permanently confined to their homes (that would be analogous to banning driving) but that we follow well thought-out temporary measures to reduce the risk....wear seatbelts, drive sober...etc. </p>
<p>What exactly those reasonable controls are is a valid point for well intentioned people to debate.</p>

        <p>Deaths from COVID ALONE is 9,000. That’s less than 13,000. </p>
<p>You don’t get to count every heart attack where someone also had covid as a covid death.</p>

<p>Please, for your sake, learn to look things up and stop "learning" from Aunt Becky's facebook posts.  </p>
<p>If you nuke LA you can't count the death toll at 8 Million.  Lots of them had other issues, overweight, underweight, diabetes, genetic abnormalities, high cholesterol, over the age of 65....heck I bet that nuke only "really" killed about 50,000 otherwise 100% healthy people.   /s</p>
<p>Please address the fact that there has been a statistically significant uptick in the number of death certificates issued worldwide.  What do you think is causing that?  killer bathtubs?</p>

        <p>You’re just clinging to paranoia. Probably so you can keep getting your unemployment check. You’ll evaporate after the election like every other panic we have had to deal with. Y2K was gonna kill us all. Global warming was gonna kill us all. Net neutrality was gonna kill us all. I work in an office with 140 people. I have 13 aunts, 14 uncles, 35 cousins.  None of my co workers and none of my family even knows someone who had covid. And this is after 6 months of it. I know more people who got food poisoning since March than who got covid. It’s no more serious than the flu.</p>
<p>Oh and I live in Michigan. The third-worst hit place.</p>

        <p>So, don’t address any of my point and go for your 5th logical fallacy, (ad hom) gotcha.</p>
<p>I’m a military pilot and have been for 23 years, so no; I’m not collecting an unemployment check and nor am I prone to paranoia.  I’m not averse to risk but I do think it’s wise to implement strategies and tactics that will limit the death toll and shorten the duration of the pandemic. </p>
<p>The “I haven’t personally seen it” is the issue I was driving at to start this.  I personally don’t know a single friend or family member that has ever died in a car crash. Weird huh? Does that mean “big airbag” is making it all up?  Or maybe I’ve lived a fortunate life and my small sample size is not necessarily indicative  of the reliability of larger metrics. </p>
<p>And you cite another conspiracy theory by saying this will all stop after the election. So are over 100 other countries going through lockdowns and financial upheaval to effect the outcome of the US election?  </p>
<p>I don’t intend to sound mean but you come off as a person who doesn’t read much other than social media and who isn’t particularly well travelled. Both of those things can be fixed by you if you want to (admittedly the second one is next to impossible for the moment).  I honestly think that would do wonders for you.  </p>
<p>I do completely agree with your points about overblown hysteria.  For example I do believe in global warming, and that it can have real effects on our grandkids, grandkids.  Some people see that and want to rightly motivate people to act, so they vastly overstate the case....we are all going to die in 5 years if we don’t get rid of fossil fuels!!!...etc.  And yes, some people have been doing that with COVID.  That doesn’t mean that it isn’t very serious and we should take reasonable precautions.</p>
