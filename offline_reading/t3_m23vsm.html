<p>So, you're saying that mask mandates are great because they make more people wear masks, even though the numbers suggest this makes no statistically significant difference in the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>&rt;When lives are at stake I'd say it's absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Oh please. Can we all agree that appeal to emotion is the most obvious logical fallacy? The data doesn't support your claim. Vague flapping around the fact that people have died (which is factually correct) offers no support for masking or not masking.</p>
<p>It would be a different matter if you could prove with evidence that making healthy people wear masks made a real difference in saving lives, then you'd have a point. But, as of yet, you have presented no evidence to support this claim.</p>

        <p>Idk how big of an impact wearing masks has, I just don't think this graph is representative of it. This is a difference between whether or not it is mandated, but most people aren't making the decision based off of the mandate. I for one would still wear a mask even if my government stopped mandating it. So the mandate is influencing a small amount of people who are going to wear a mask or not based on the mandate. <br>
I don't think its a logical fallacy. Fact: People are dying. Fact:Wearing a mask is more effective (however small) than not wearing a mask at preventing people from contracting the cause of death. Conclusion: You have a moral obligation to wear one in public.</p>

        <p>&rt; Idk how big of an impact wearing masks has</p>
<p>And yet you claim to know enough to make a moral decree that everyone should wear one? Let me get this straight. You don't know how effective something is, and yet you're certain it is effective? Why are you so certain of an effect you can't even measure or quantify?</p>
<p>&rt; I just don't think this graph is representative of it. This is a difference between whether or not it is mandated, but most people aren't making the decision based off of the mandate.</p>
<p>And if you look back at my initial comment, I was specifically criticizing <strong>mask mandates</strong>. This was literally my entire point. We agree so far. I don't have a problem with you deciding to keep wearing a mask even though you're not required to. That's fine, just don't try to force others to wear one.</p>
<p>&rt; I don't think its a logical fallacy.</p>
<p>That's the thing about fallacies. They help us understand our blind spots, but we have trouble seeing them ourselves.</p>
<p>&rt; Fact:Wearing a mask is more effective (however small) than not wearing a mask at preventing people from contracting the cause of death. </p>
<p>You're just repeating yourself with no substantiation. I'll say it again: you need to support your claims with evidence. Don't forget that you also need to support asymptomatic spread if you want to make a case that asymptomatic people need to wear masks.</p>
<p>&rt; Conclusion: You have a moral obligation to wear one in public.</p>
<p>That's quite a leap. That's certainly not the case if you can't support your points. Without that support, this is just more virtue signaling and appeal to emotion. </p>
<p>You can keep your mask on, I don't have a problem with that. Just stop telling me it's my moral obligation and expect me to believe you without any quantifiable, statistically significant evidence.</p>

        <p>&rt;You don't know how effective something is, and yet you're certain it is effective?</p>
<p>Dude just google "are masks effective". There's your evidence. At this point if you think masks don't work you've either been living under a rock, or you've simply been ignoring the experts in the field. Also it stands to reason that any barrier ,no matter how flimsy, is better than no barrier. 
But lets forget about that for a moment. I don't understand why people don't want to wear masks. There is no drawbacks. Either they don't work and you are mildly inconvenienced, or they do and you are helping prevent the spread of the pandemic. 
&rt;need to support asymptomatic spread</p>
<p>No I don't. Frankly I'm more concerned about people who think they just have a cold and are out and about anyway.</p>

        <p>It has three sources listed, but anybody could write that there. None of those three sources have this chart in their sites. The fact that there are three implies some kind of meta analysis using the three. I am asking to see that.</p>

        <p>Conclusion: Mandates are ignored by the populace for the most part. Most mask wearers are still going to wear them even if there is no mandate. The small percentage of them that do stop wearing them would account for that blue line being pretty consistently higher than the orange one.</p>

        <p>This graph has no source. </p>
<p>County level analysis of Kansas when counties did and didn't have mask mandates showed that the virus spread more quickly in the mask free counties.</p>
<p>I'll actually provide the direct CDC link backing this claim, unlike this fake graph.

        <p>If you put 100,000 people all spread apart, nobody gets covid. If they all have to live in close proximity the numbers will be higher. There’s no denying cities/towns with mask mandate are higher in population and in population density than no mask places. It’s like comparing NYC to a bunch of conservative bum fuck no where towns that add up to the population and call it good.</p>
<p>It’s undeniable wearing a mask helps lower the spread. It’s not even a hard concept, you morons. Surgeons have been doing it for a long time. Why do you think that is? Was it a show in preparation of covid? Has my dad seriously been wearing a mask when he performs surgery for 30+ years so he can own some conservative idiots? You got us.</p>

        <p>What are you having trouble understanding? This is a pretty much worthless graph designed to mislead. First it's counting positive Covid tests per 100,000 people, which isn't very useful because tests aren't given to a random distribution (plus Covid deniers are probably less likely to take a test in the first place). Second the categories it is ranking <em>are</em> worthless. Mask states vs no-mask states? For that to be valid every city would need to follow the state, and everyone would need to follow what the state was saying.</p>
<p>Well obviously that's not the case. People in Texas wear masks of their own free will, and people in California don't. Speaking of texas, it's a no-mask state, but despite that large cities (where transmission is mostly likely) like Austin have separate mandates, or have enacted them.</p>
<p>TLDR: The the data the graph displays is too nebulous to have deductive value.</p>

<p>why would "everyone" need to follow what the state is saying?  So one person who doesn't follow the rules it ruins the whole thing?   Right.   And it's not as if masks have ever been claimed to make that much difference anyway....</p>
<p>"The first five days after a mandate, the daily growth rate slowed by 0.9 percentage-points compared to the five days prior to the mandate; at three weeks, the daily growth rate had slowed by 2 percentage-points."  <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent</a></p>
<p>So it slowed the "growth rate" by 2 percentage points.  That just simply slows things down by 2% points....thus, 2 percent of the people who didn't get it this month, will probably get it next month.  Big friggin deal. Not to mention that 99% of all pro-maskers aren't wearing their masks at home and around friends.   such a joke that they ridicule others for not wearing masks around people when they do the same thing.</p>

<p>If you look at a graph of covid19 infections in the USA, you'll notice it's constantly changing. The study was done from March 31 and May 22, 2020, clearly the virus was on the decline as the weather warmed up. It's bullshit to attribute that decline to mask mandates. Should we equally blame masks for the rise in cases in late fall, early winter?</p>

        <p>A) This lumps all states into two categories, ignoring population density which is a very important variable here.</p>
<p>B) Even with the best cherry picked data you can find, over this time period this data shows the No Mask states are showing an average of 2-5% more cases. So wearing a mask (which is easy, and can be done with zero harm to the person doing it) can save us 2-5% of positive cases!? SUPER WORTH - WEAR THE MASK.</p>
<p>C) I can cherry pick too. See this <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJXQltetd12fK7PPviVsmi-t5wE=/0x0:1600x1572/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:1600x1572):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22008841/Chart3_Kansas_Final.jpg">Kansas County Comparison</a></p>

        <p>The fact that they follow exactly the same curve is not a coincidence. There are densely populated states with no mask mandate, and sparsely populated states with a mandate. It's not a consistent variable across the two.</p>

  Yes, masks, whilst a huge breach of bodily autonomy unsupported by any scientific evidence, are not the worst breach of human rights in and of themselves, but like a swastika armband, they signal your obedience to an authoritarian regime that tramples all over basic human rights. <br>
  You lockdown proponents honestly sicken me. You sing the praises of fascism, of policies that are driving people to suicide and have pushed over 100 million people to starvation and you have the absolute hide to pretend that you are good, moral people for doing so. You know, people in Nazi Germany who ratted out their Jewish neighbours to the SS all convinced themselves that they were good people for doing it too. But history judged them harshly, and it will judge you and your ilk the same way.  <br>
  Oh, and the irony of you accusing us of shouting "fire" in a crowded theatre is just breathtaking. Whose side of this argument recklessly incited panic, despite the obvious catastrophic consequences of doing so? Not mine. That was you and your fearmongering friends.</p>

        <p>Depends what date you look at. At 12/11 masked people appeared to be 7% more likely to catch covid. 12/31 you were also apparently safer going mask-less. Of course it all averages out to around equal. Whether people wore their lucky article of clothing or not. Guess everyone's been forced to dress up in a costume for no reason. Who would have thought?</p>

        <p>Oh no! 2-5%? Well that just knocks our whole argument down flat. /s</p>
<p>Man, if only Cases weren't based on absolute bullshit PCR tests that have a massive false positive rate... and if the real positive infections (people that *actually got sick* that is) didn't have a 99.98% survival chance... then MAYBE that five percent might mean something! </p>
<p>Also, it's been a whole fucking year now. The new flus and colds are getting ready to make their yearly rounds, they aren't any more of a deadly plague than the last one. Just trash the damn mask already.</p>

<p>I pray that one day you will regret spreading dangerous messages on public forums that lead to reckless behavior and needless deaths.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask is <em>so</em> easy to do, causes you no harm, and only the mildest of inconveniences. Sacrifice a modicum of comfort to save lives. Please stop spreading harmful disinformation.</p>

<p>Now this is just sad. Vernon Coleman once said:</p>
<p><strong>"It is now my considered view that the disease we know as AIDS probably doesn't exist and has never existed"</strong> </p>
<p>Sources <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Coleman">1</a> and <a href="http://www.vernoncoleman.com/aids.htm">2</a>. </p>
<p>He is a clown, and he is just as wrong about face masks as he is about AIDS and vaccinations. Try these reputable sources instead! The (real) scientific community <em>overwhelmingly</em> agrees upon the effectiveness of cloth face masks in combating the spread of COVID-19:</p>

        <p>I see you fell into my trap, you never looked at it at all and decided to ad hominen like a good little slave.</p>
<p>He cites many studies, the journals they are in, the title of the study and gives the conclusions for people who are lazy like you. </p>
<p>For example, here are just a few from the book:</p>
<p>In 2015, the British Medical Journal published a paper entitled, A Cluster Randomised Trial 
of Cloth Masks Compared with Medical Masks in Healthcare Workers. The paper was 
written by nine authors from the University of New South Wales, the University of Sydney, 
the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Vietnam and the Beijing Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention in China. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy 
of cloth masks to medical masks in hospital health care workers. The study, which was 
extensive, concluded that the results caution against the use of cloth masks.</p>
<p>Those dismissing the danger as non-existent might like to read 
HSE Contract Research Report no 27/1991, produced by the British Health and Safety 
Executive and entitled, Dead space and inhaled carbon dioxide levels in respiratory 
protective equipment. Those dismissing the risks associated with carbon dioxide levels should 
know that the amount of carbon dioxide in a small room can easily rise to levels which are 
dangerous enough to have a dramatic effect on decision making. At least eight studies in the 
last decade have studied carbon dioxide levels indoors and have found worrying levels above 
1,200 parts per million.</p>
<p>In a paper published in MedRxiv.2020 entitled, Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce 
the spread of respiratory viruses, T.Jefferson, M.Jones et al concluded that compared to not 
wearing a mask there was no reduction of influenza-like illnesses when health care workers 
or the general population wore masks.
In March 2020, Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer in the UK, warned that it 
is possible to trap the virus in a mask and start breathing it in. She said that wearing a mask 
was not a good idea.</p>
<p>A meta-analysis published in May in 2020 by the Centers for Disease Control was entitled, 
Non-pharmaceutical measures for pandemic influenza in non-healthcare settings – personal 
protective and environment measures. The authors concluded that the evidence from 
randomized controlled trials of face masks did not support a substantial effect on the 
transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza, either when worn by infected persons or by 
persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility.</p>
<p>In 2019, a scientific paper written by L.Radonovich and M.Simberkoff was published in the 
Journal of the American Medical Association. The paper was entitled, N95 respirators vs 
medical masks for preventing influenza among health care personnel: a randomized clinical 
trial. The study involved 2,862 volunteers and showed that both surgical masks and N95 
respirators ‘resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory confirmed 
influenza’.</p>
<p>A paper entitled, Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common cold 
among health workers in Japan: a randomized clinical trial was published in the American 
Journal of Infection Control in June 2009. The authors concluded that face mask use was 
found not to be protective against the common cold when compared to controls who did not 
wear face masks.</p>
<p>A paper by H.Jung and J.Kim, which was entitled, Comparison of filtration efficiency and 
pressure drop in anti-yellow sand masks, quarantine masks, medical masks, general masks 
and handkerchiefs, was published in Aerosol Air Qual Res in June 2013. The paper studied 
44 mask brands and found that the average penetration was 35.6%. Even most medical masks 
had over 20% penetration. Most importantly, the study found that general masks and 
handkerchiefs had no protective function in terms of aerosol filtration efficiency.</p>
<p>I could go on and on, not as lazy as you, so I'll stop there.</p>
