    <strong>Compilation: Ethylmercury in Vaccines (TLDR: Dubious Safety at Best!)</strong>
    <p><p>Disclaimer: I am 100% anti-vaxx and fully support the choice of informed people to receive vaccines for themselves and their children. I got into an interesting (and extremely amicable) discussion with someone about ethylmercury and methylmercury, and I thought that this info would be beneficial to the sub.  I am not here to convince you of anything: I am here to give you information with which to make a decision. </p>

<p>EPA methylmercury and ethylmercury limits are both 0.1 micrograms of HG per kg of human body weight. Flu shots have 25 micrograms, which means that unless you're 250 kgs, you're being overdosed with Hg.</p>

<p>\&rt;&rt;&rt;Blair AMJN, Clark B, Clark AJ, Wood P. Tissue concentrations of mercury after chronic dosing of squirrel monkeys with thimerosal. Toxicology. 1975;3(2):171-6. </p>
<p>TLDR: Squirrel monkeys dosed intranasally with thimerosal or saline for 6 consecutive days. Compared to saline group, mercury concentrations in the Thimerosal group were significantly raised in the brain, liver, muscle, and kidney. Conclusion - “accumulation of mercury from chronic use of thiomersal-preserved medicines is viewed as a potential health hazard for man.” </p>

<p>TLDR: @ 0.02% concentration of methylmercury, ethylmercury had the ability to reduce the feasibility of human cells invitro. </p>

<p>\&rt;&rt;&rt; Skerfving S, Organic mercury compounds—relation between exposure and effect. Mercury in the Environment. Friberg L, Vostal J, eds. CRC Press, Cleveland. 1972; 141-68. </p>
<p>TLDR:  Ethylmercury chloride killed off half of a test population of mice—a classic “LD50” (lethal dose) study—within a week at a concentration of 12 milligrams of mercury per kilogram of body weight; methylmercury chloride’s LD50, meanwhile, lethal to half the mice was 14 milligrams. </p>

<p>TLDR:  Ethylmercury “proved much more toxic” than methylmercury in pigs.</p>

<p>TLDR:  Neurotoxicity of both mercury types was broadly comparable. Higher levels of inorganic mercury were found in the kidneys and brains of rats that were fed ethylmercury, though more brain damage was seen in the methylmercury-fed rats. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>TLDR:  Thimerosal also passes more easily from a mother’s bloodstream through the placenta into a developing baby than does methylmercury.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>TLDR:  Mice injected with Thimerosal accumulated mercury in both the brain and kidneys. After 7 days, mercury levels decreased in the blood but were unchanged in the brain compared to levels measured just twenty-four hours after treatment, indicating slow clearance. </p>

<p>TLDR:  Rat pups given either Thimerosal or inorganic mercury three times in their first 11 days of life, mimicking human infant vaccination schedules. The scientists then assessed the total retention of mercury and excretion over six days. The Thimerosal-exposed rats showed higher mercury retention rates in their brains, in line with some other results described in this chapter. Furthermore, these Thimerosal-exposed rats exhibited similar faecal excretion and much lower urinary excretion compared to the inorganic mercury-exposed rats. That second group also demonstrated higher retention rates of mercury in organs other than the brain.</p></p>
