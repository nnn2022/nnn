        <p>A.) all of those nations have hundreds (and sometimes thousands) of years of government history that disallows certain things that Americans take for granted like Ideas of natural rights, social contract, popular sovereignty, limited government and republicanism. </p>
<p>B.) All of those nations have heavy handed governments that allow very little say from the people. The downfall (though I see it as an upside because I hate centralized government) is that states have rights too which mucks up any type of uniformal organization across the board.</p>
<p>C.) There is too much resistance for it to take hold. Corporations and rich individuals will see their tax rates skyrocket which will cause them to either flee to tax sanctuaries or raise their prices on consumers causing goods and services to increase in cost. This then leads to the need to tax ordinary citizens at an increased rate to perhaps 55% in cases like Denmark or 36% like France. Plus, we all know that when the government controls something, price control goes out the window, especially when Unions gain a foothold (imagine the chaos of doctors unions)</p>
<p>With all the inherent problems and resistance to the idea, and if it works so well in other nations, why would anybody stay here and fight for it? If I thought it was so great I would have packed up and immigrated to Europe or Canada a long time ago because, who knows how long it’ll take for America to get it right?</p>

        <p>No lmao what? You apparently don't know history. Most countries are not more than 300 years old. France? Was a monarchy before. Germany? Empire. And why do you think european countries don't have these things? And why would that be a bad thing? Republicanism is a thing in the US. And limited government is also bad (see USA)</p>
<p>According to multiple indexes, the USA is a flawed democracy and most European Countries are above the USA when it comes to democracy (Finnland, Denmark, Sweden, etc.)</p>
<p>That is GOOD. They should see their taxes skyrocket. Don't see the problem here. Increase taxes on the rich, lower them for others. And as we can see with medicine and healthcare, if the government controls the prices (or regulates) it works better. i.e. Insulin in Canada/Europe vs USA</p>

        <p>A monarchy is a form of government. An empire is traditionally paired with an autocratic form of government overseen by the emperor which has ultimate power over its citizens. </p>
<p>The USA is not a democracy, rather a constitutional federal republic wherein the citizens hold power but elect representatives to exercise that power.</p>
<p>As far as raising taxes on the rich, it is extremely naive to think that the rich won’t run for cover in a tax sanctuary in another country (which the USA has no power to control) and it is equally naive to think that corporations won’t raise their prices to offset the tax increases. Corporations are evil right? Well, In keeping with that tradition, they’ll take their profit no matter what. Then you have a situation like my Danish relatives who come to the US once a year with 4 empty suitcases so they can bring home things like blue jeans, collared shirts, food items etc. that are wildly expensive because of the corporate tax threshold in their country. </p>
<p>I know it sounds so wonderful to play Robin Hood and take the money from the evil corporations and the disgustingly rich, but they’re pretty intelligent. In the end, all it will do is hurt your wallet and reduce the amount of jobs to go around.</p>

        <p>True dat.</p>
<p>It's supposed to be both. Democratic Republics exist. And the US is supposed to be just that.</p>
<p>Countries with Universal Healthcare still have companies? Your argument doesn't work in the real world. Most corporations are evil, yes, that's why we should give them to their workers and not some ceo who doesn't do shit. A Big Mac in Denmark for example costs about 1$ more than in the US. And they have Universal Healthcare. Your argument again doesn't work in the real world. And there is also your beloved market, so if something is too expensive, people will go to a different company. And that is anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>Then get UBI too :)</p>

        <p>Gunna use Canada as an example of a country that has universal healthcare here. 
A.) not sure what government history has to do with it. Canada is younger than the US, we have pretty much identical natural rights, and still have universal healthcare.
B.) definitely disagree that the government is heavy handed or gives us little day as people. It’s a confederation not a federation like the US, each province could be referred to as a nation if they so choose (Quebec is possibly choosing to do so). Also each of our 10 provinces get a lot of say in self governance, some provinces were their own country until after ww2. 
C.) the main wealthy resistance seems to come from companies that are profiting from your system off the backs off the people. Taxes might go up a bit, but healthcare costs will go down. Because your insurance is typically tied to employment, employers would save on what they pay into insurance and employees would pay less for more. Think of it like everybody in the country was able to negotiate insurance cost and coverage at the same time, the insurance company wouldn’t be able to charge predatory pricing. This is single payer healthcare. </p>
<p>You guys can keep your system if you really want though, coming up north of the border to buy our cheaper meds all the time helps our economy I guess. </p>
<p>Sorry i felt I had to reply when I saw your second point trying to say countries with universal healthcare are heavy handed and allow us little say. The US isn’t the only country with freedom, we’ve just chosen to express ours differently.</p>

        <p>Just because something is cheaper doesn’t mean it is free. If I went to Saudi Arabia and spent .10 a gallon on gas there compared to 3 bucks in America I wouldn’t say it was free dipshit. When you refer to taxpayer funded benefits as “free” it just clouds the minds of those with less cognitive ability to determine if something is really free or not.</p>

        <p>Communism is a stateless, moneyless classless society. I don't think any industrialized nation in the world currently fits that description. Let me guess, you're an american and over 40 years old? The Red Scare Propaganda got to you hard and now you think everything you don't like is communism.?</p>

        <p>It is approved, the chemicals in it are listed and approved. America doesn't have free Healthcare because they don't care for the 99%. They don't care for the poor. They are crapitalist pig-dogs who are in it for their own self gain. I didn't belive it when they said the vax was free instead of a thousand dollars. This is painfully obvious. Only socialism and communism care for the people, instead of using you as profit generating pawns.</p>

        <p>What is no u supposed to make me do? It is only a way for you to avoid doing anything that might prove me right, and you fear that you will (100% chance) and that means you have a bit of insecurity about your claims, meaning you should rethink them. You are already getting a lot of exercise dodging my request and the truth. Must be pretty swol online but a pathetic excuse for a human irl, so go outside and follow everything set out by the gov't and do everything listed here step-by-step so you don't tire from all that hard work, mmkay?</p>
