    <strong>World Economic Forum's "Known Traveller Digital Identity project" (Canadian Travel)</strong>
    <p><p>Here is an update on the coming <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6061433?fbclid=IwAR2YlaL9No2k-Lp4E8Q-QII5k1uzIms_8bXrfqWmXk9USFC6v3Xg38GF-T0">changes to Canadian travel.</a> This will likely not be limited to Canada. Our federal government is working with the World Economic Forum to modernize our borders with more automated features, ie. facial Identification, digital health identification, and digital travel documentation. It seems like everything is going digital, and our privacy is being compromised for efficiency and a sense of safety.</p>

<p>&rt;Just as the 9/11 attacks did 20 years ago, the COVID-19 pandemic will transform the way people travel internationally — with hundreds of millions of dollars in new government spending planned for modernizing border security and updating public health measures at airports.<br>

That's a place where you can have some differentiation of the travel experience to make it a little smoother, a little bit more pleasant for those who have been vaccinated. But we don't know yet what the government's plans are for that," Gooch said.<br>

"Your verification is done through your facial ID, which is connected to your Known Traveller Digital Identification, which is connected to your digital health information and your digital travel documentation.</p></p>
