        <p>The article itself claims one of the foremost experts on viral pathogens, Shi Zhengli, got it wrong on that sequence due to 'bad science' and uses skeptical tricks to try and prove their point. The truth is, once again, much simpler: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6503/487</p>

        <p>I don't think it just claims she got it 'wrong' but intentionally misled. Now I don't know anything about this topic so I don't have a position. Personally, I think it is unlikely that a world renowned scientist would make an error like this, intentional or not. However, I do think that the worlds best minds should be closely examining the sequences here, and if it is even possible to try to determine the likelihood of their occurring in nature. This kind of topic is very challenging to be honest - because on one hand you have China, with strong-arm control of their population (and Zhengli worked in a national military level laboratory) and a motivation to deceive and harm the west, and on the other hand a media that has to toe the line and not piss them off. Looking deeper into this must be very complex, and the burden of proof should be high, so until there is some conclusion we are left with these people who speculate. </p>
<p>I wasn't going to say anything, but maybe I should have, that this 'undeniable evidence' is only enough to raise some important questions, but not even close to conclusive.</p>

        <p>You post an article that relies on the testimony Shi and Daszak, the alleged perpetrators?</p>
<p>Excuse me if I don't find that super convincing...</p>
<p>As u/decentpie has pointed out, the crux of what NerdHasPower is saying is that Shi intentionally invented the genetic sequence of RaTG13 on the computer, using the genome(s) of ZC45 and/or ZXC21 as a template.</p>
<p>Shi has admitted that there are no actual physical samples of RaTG13, just the genetic sequence in the database.</p>
<p>NerdHasPower noticed patterns in the genetic code of RaTG13 inconsistent with natural evolution suggesting human interference, particularly in sequences relating to non-synonymous mutations.</p>
<p>Knowing that the gain-of-function-produced SARS-CoV-2 was so different from naturally-occurring examples published thus far, Shi, an expert in coronavirus genetics, invented an intermediary virus on the computer by manually altering letter sequences in specific areas of her ZC45/ZXC21 template, enough for RaTG13 (as she would name this new sequence) to appear to be a missing link between the two.</p>
