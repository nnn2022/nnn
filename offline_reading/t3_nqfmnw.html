        <p>Why is anyone bringing this up? He said that out loud, in interview. That was his first comment before getting hounded by MSM &amp; Facebook goobers that 'it might help' &amp; he finally caved to the idiots.</p>
<p>He then went on to say a year later that the rags do nothing, but then literally doubled down to say "wear two". </p>
<p>But not N-95... Not recommended!</p>

        <p>The argument they were using before was that he lied about masks not being needed because there weren't enough to go around and they needed to keep the ones that were available for doctors/nurses/frontliners/etc.</p>
<p>They can't claim that anymore because of this email, so they have switched to claiming that he changed his statement about masks because a study appeared proving that the past 100+ years of studies were wrong. </p>
<p>Nobody can produce this study of course since it doesn't exist. They will argue that it's a top secret document, which is why they can't produce it. But why would a study proving that masks work be hidden from the public if they wanted everybody to wear masks?</p>
