    <strong>What is the explanation for a great variety of Covid-19 symptoms within the same household?</strong>
    <p><p>A friend of mine told me a few days ago that he &amp; his mother had been tested positive for Covid-19. </p>
<p>My friend lives with both of his parents. He himself describes it as the worst illness he remembers having. He describes intense stomach cramps, runny nose &amp; a bad taste / smell that never goes away. He says his lungs feel like smoking pure, hot weed... like from a bong without water... And intense coughing... Massive head aches... Then came muscle aches... like you just finished an intense workout session on all of your muscles.</p>
<p>He describes his mother's symptoms as significantly milder : "<em>feeling of burnt trachia; mild sore throat, swollen nasal cavity, desensitised taste &amp; smell</em>".</p>
<p>His father, who has by far the weakest health in the family, barely has any symptoms at all.</p>
<p>Since these people all live in the same house, it's unlikely that they don't have the same condition... whatever that condition may be. So why are their symptoms so different? Different degree of immunity?</p></p>

        <p>It's just like any other virus. Each person's body responds differently to different viruses. Last year, my husband and granddaughter who lives with us came down with the flu. My husband was sick as a dog, my granddaughter was sick, but not as bad as my husband, and I never got it, despite being in close contact with both of them. </p>
<p>Not sure if this is what you were looking for, just wanted to share an experience I had to maybe help you understand.</p>

        <p>No, it isn't. This is a vascular virus that attacks blood vessels and arteries and veins. That is why it is so concerning to doctors, because they know from past history that with vascular viruses people can have permanent damage that never heals in their hearts, kidneys, lungs, etc.</p>
<p>That said with the majority of people having CoVid-19, we are not seeing that long-term lasting damage.</p>
<p>The long-haulers are the 1 out of 1000 much like with other colds/flus in the past.</p>
<p>The biggest concern is that relatively healthy people like my 69 at the time of her passing mother are dying from this virus.</p>
<p>We almost never see that with other colds and flus where someone who is relatively healthy suddenly sickens severely with a Cytokine storm and dies.</p>

        <p>That is 100% wrong and a lie. Healthy people and children die of the flu every year. The flu is still more dangerous than the Rona</p>

        <p>&rt;different immune response , no mystery.</p>
<p>That's what I would expect... especially considering we're talking about people in the same household.</p>
<p>A "different strain" can't possibly explain that.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;all are symptoms of any mild cold or flu. nothing new as the media would have you believe.</p>
<p>Definitely doesn't seem more severe than the worst cases of stomach flu or pneumonia I've had...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;don't fall for they hype, i'm sure you and everyone else has been sick before</p>
<p>I'm definitely not falling for the hype. I'm just trying to make sense of what is happening.</p>
<p>And I'm trying to figure out what's the best approach to take in case I do get seriously ill.</p>
<p>In case of a severe case of pneumonia, I generally hang over a bowl of water with some Vicks VapoRub, to get rid of the mucus in my lungs. </p>
<p>In case of a severe case of stomach flu, I generally just wait until my digestion system is as empty as possible, and consume only fluids, until my body starts to stabilize.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if these same approaches would apply to Covid, though...</p>

        <p>Anything you describe as a "stomach flu" isn't the flu. Most likely food poisoning. Completely different beast.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind, your friend with a lot of bad smoking experience may not be in the best shape when it comes to respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>Also, there are a lot of opportunistic diseases that can precede or result from poorly handling a cold. Covid doesn't cause pneumonia, but can certainly lead to it if not addressed properly (usually meaning fluids and rest). Attaching all possible secondary diseases as covid symptoms is part of why we're in this mess.</p>

        <p>&rt;Anything you describe as a "stomach flu" isn't the flu. Most likely food poisoning. Completely different beast.</p>
<p>Wikipedia just told me :</p>
<p><em>Gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea and gastro, is inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract—the stomach and small intestine. Symptoms may include diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Fever, lack of energy and dehydration may also occur. This typically lasts less than two weeks.</em> <strong><em>It is not related to influenza, though it has erroneously been called the "stomach flu".</em></strong><br>
<strong><em>Gastroenteritis is usually caused by viruses.</em></strong> <em>However, bacteria, parasites, and fungus can also cause gastroenteritis. In children, rotavirus is the most common cause of severe disease. In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common causes.</em></p>
<p>So, "stomach flu" is often caused by a virus... but not per se... and even then it's not really flu or related to the flu.</p>
<p>Gotcha!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Also keep in mind, your friend with a lot of bad smoking experience may not be in the best shape when it comes to respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>Haven't we all experimented with weed when we were young?</p>
<p>Anyway, my friend hasn't smoked in many years AFAIK. I'm sure his lungs have recovered at least mostly from any smoking he did in the past.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

        <p>This happens with many viruses and the like. When I get the flu, it takes me out completely and sometimes I end up in the hospital. When my brother gets the flu he has very mild symptoms. I’m not a doctor and can’t get into the whole different immune responses thing too deep but it’s very common. Also depends what other conditions one has of course, if your body is already functioning at a below optimum level, a virus is going to knock that down even further.</p>
