    <strong>Will the Biden-Harris administration tighten lockdowns and restrictions like we've never seen before or will they be our "saving grace" in terms of this "pandemic"?</strong>
    <p><p>What we see now is the majority of states enforcing Covid rules, some barley at all. </p>
<p>I like this sub, but there is a lot of reverse fear-porn if you will. Since some of the most upvoted posts seem to be about a dystopia. </p>
<p>All I want is you honest opinions, thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>Honestly, I think it comes down to each individual state, and upcoming elections. We’ve still got the constitution and the 9/10th amendments which still gives states some sort of autonomy to govern as they see fit for the most part. </p>
<p>BUT more democratic states will gladly roll along with whatever the Biden Harris team wants imo. Being from Michigan I do worry, Whitler loves her lockdowns and stupid orders. The Michigan sub on Reddit often jumps between the love of smelling her farts and being confused by her orders but still loving her.</p>
<p>Personally I think she’s a dangerous idiot. Trump can’t really do much in the way of states and how they handle this stuff except bitch about her, which she gladly took and ran with to fame and everyone genuinely thinks he could do much of anything about her/our legislation.  </p>
<p>Even when our senate removed her emergency powers and tried to open back up the state, she found various loopholes since our health dept and other agencies tend to be pretty powerful comparatively. So she went through them to continue her reign. Any politician of any side that refuses to listen to their people and refuses to give up power is dangerous. </p>
<p>And unfortunately Biden is looking to make the the VP of the DNC... Which honestly I’m kind of okay with if it gets her out of Michigan. But then it will just boost her ego and give her more overall power. </p>
<p>A lot of us are just scared. We see the direction the world is heading, and we don’t like it. This is no way to live. Doomers love to say if we’re like New Zealand and just did as we’re told we’d be done with this already.</p>
<p>But the problem is. The us government has a long history of getting bigger and bigger and not shrinking back down and has no problem stepping on its people. </p>
<p>There’s an old Native saying. “You can trust the government, just ask a Native American.”</p>
<p>Also- happy cake day.</p>

        <p>Politics will play a role later this year.  I’m in Michigan too and I haven’t encountered anywhere in the state outside of Ann Arbor that’s in love with living like this.   There is another election next year. If this isn’t solved by the fall it’ll be tough for her or any Dem to win again.</p>

        <p>They will lock down harder, and come up with even more irrational and dictatorial restrictions - they will likely use the pretext of the threat of "right wing extremism", as well as the Rona, to do it.</p>
<p>The hard core, up and coming Democrats like Harris, AOC, and the Squad are anti-capitalist. The additional lockdowns will crush yet more businesses and get more people on the dole - which is what they want. They can then bring in UBI and look like saviours. How they will pay for this is another matter. Expect truly confiscatory tax rates.</p>
<p>They will also use their corrupt courts to find more and more ways to do end-runs around the Constitution, if not attempt to actually try and rewrite the parts they don't like.</p>
<p>Expect the above to be used to crush dissent. They are also hoping that if they poke the bear enough, they will foment civil unrest, giving a pretext to invoke the Insurrection Act - which will become a permanent condition.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope I'm wrong, but given the fact that these people just stole an election, I think they are capable of anything.</p>

        <p>The problem people like Newsom and Biden have is that people compare Florida, Texas etc. to places like California, and scratch their heads at what a cluster CA is despite doing everything “right”.  Even in CA, and despite an incredible amount of media bias, people are turning against Newsom and lockdowns (www.recallgavin2020.com, btw).  If Biden tries to implement any sort of national mandate a chunk of states will tell him to pound sand, and it’ll just give oxygen to the issue.</p>
<p>Most of these places seem to have peaked, I would assume a rapid fall will be assisted by the vaccine, which will allow places like CA to declare victory (“just think how bad it would have been if we hadn’t locked down”), and then opening up will be the rage.  Economically CA can’t stay closed, they are haemorrhaging money, people and companies, and places like TX are reaping the rewards.</p>

        <p>In a word, no.<br>
Democrats didn’t win some sort of mandate. You still have 75MM people that voted for Trump.  They lost seats in the House. Governorships in MI, WI, and PA are poachable especially if this keeps up past the fall.  To think Dems are just going to roll through and put the country under their thumb is just nonsense. It’s pure nonsense and it’s why the temperature is so high right now. Both sides see each other as an enemy and forget that we have federalism. </p>
<p>States still have plenty of rights.  The feds really can’t force the states to do much of anything. </p>
<p>If you want the conspiracy angle: what better way to have your party looked upon as saviors than to be the party that got us out of masks by summer??? Doing that could keep Republicans that just couldn’t stand Trump so they voted for Biden filling in the D bubble for a while.</p>

        <p>There is only so much the federal government can do. They can tie policies to funding. They can also encourage the leaders of the health organizations to come out with certain policies. None of what the CDC has been saying is based on actual science, so with the right motivation, they can easily flip, or they can make statements even more ridiculous than masks are better than vaccines.</p>
