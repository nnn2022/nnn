    <strong>Ontario Care Home 'Outbreak' in question after retesting of affected staff</strong>
    <p><p>Apologies if this has already been posted. </p>
<p>In Northern Ontario, a region which has been ordered to remain in the highest level of lockdown (partly due to this outbreak) the employees of a care home tested positive for COVID and at least one variant of concern. They got retested, most (it is unclear exactly how many) that were retested were negative, and the official statement is that it is not appropriate to clear them of COVID... But apparently, it was perfectly fine to say they had COVID after the one test. Read the article for yourself, it is complete nonsense. Also, each positive result is going to remain in the COVID statistics for the region. </p>
<p>In similar news, there was a condo in Ontario that official were warning about the 'dire risk' due to someone testing positive for the highly contagious variant. So they tested the whole building and everyone was negative. They are really starting to lose their sway over people.</p>
