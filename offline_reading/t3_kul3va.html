    <strong>Do they truly not see how hypocritical they are?</strong>
    <p><p>Sudden mask mandate in my city after months of nothing, and they're all stalking the place literally counting the people who have them on and don't have them on. Looking into people's cars to see how many are complying (and yes they specifically used the word complying).</p>
<p>My question is this. Are they on some kind of payroll from the government where they are being paid bonuses for keeping count, but more seriously, I can only assume 7 days ago they would have barely known what a mask is (we have been very lucky up to this point), but suddenly they're all about "health" and attacking anyone who doesn't have one on </p>
<p>So do you think they're mentally incapable of seeing how hypocritical they are, given they wouldn't have had a mask on last week, or do they see but they just don't care?</p></p>

        <p>Yes "regular" person was bragging about the numbers of people muzzled and slamming the minimal numbers of normal people. And openly admitting to looking through car windows to see how many people were complying. Welcome to Australia üëç</p>

        <p>Apparently police are pulling people over who aren't wearing them in the car though. Would love to know how I'd drive without being in a head on collision though, I need glasses and can't imagine fogged up glasses would be too great for driving</p>

        <p>Yep so the government is basically making the assumption that people will forget to take masks with them or put it on. So the solution is to just wear them every minute of the day. It feels odd to finally have globally exposed what I have for so long felt is something genuinely sinister about this country. I have seen this coming for years, and my gut feeling is finally being proved right. It's been communism here for far longer than covid has been around.</p>

        <p>God no. But I've got a newborn at home so I don't really drive much anymore. I'm terrified enough going out once a day for a 20 minute walk, no doubt these lunatics are hiding in the bushes waiting. Just trying to get past the anger so I can just get to feeling sorry for them.</p>

        <p>Dinner Lady Syndrome. A fraction of power can turn good people into anti-social harbingers of misery. This is why it's important to be humble as well as well-intentioned; if not, we only help those who would cause our ruin.</p>
