    <strong>Family just threatened to kick me out of the house if I don‚Äôt continue to wear a mask...</strong>
    <p><p>(18M) my 16 year old sister is still very scared of Covid, especially with masks starting to come off here in Minnesota. She works in a nursing home which justifies her concern a bit more, but allegedly they should be protected from the vaccine, so that doesn‚Äôt make sense. I was driving with my family and I went into a gas station, unmasked, and I came back into the car to my family telling me I was selfish, and I MUST wear a mask out of RESPECT for my sister‚Äôs fear. Not to brag, but I shattered any shred of logic they thought they had on their side, so they resorted to saying ‚Äúyou are ignoring her HUMANITY and aren‚Äôt respecting her very valid fear.‚Äù 
Ima just bullet point some other pathological logic they used:</p>
<p>You‚Äôre not being patient, mask mandates just lifted. Just give it a couple weeks. <em>just give it, say, 14 days, and her fear will probably fade awayüôÑ</em></p>
<p>You are being selfish, you‚Äôre motives are to only benefit yourself, whereas your sister is considering the lives of others. <em>Yet my sister is the one asking something of me, I‚Äôm asking nothing of anyone in this case...how selfish is it really to live without a mask?</em></p>
<p>Just think about it, and you know what the answer better be. I asked them how far they‚Äôd go to respect and validate the fears of others, but <em>they could not give me an answer</em></p>
<p>If you aren‚Äôt willing to wear a mask, you have no regard for her mental health. <em>In reality, I‚Äôm deeply saddened and disturbed by how deeply the propaganda has struck fear into her psyche. My care just isn‚Äôt validating irrational fear like they want</em></p>
<p>I told them if they make me get vaccinated fOr tHe SaKe oF rEsPeCtInG hEr vErY rEaL FeAr, I‚Äôll accept getting kicked out no questions asked. I‚Äôm gonna wear a mask simply for theatrics, instead of following the science like they‚Äôve been so motivated to do. This world is fucking crazy. It‚Äôs sickening how masks are useless, but necessary for psychological artificial comfort.</p></p>

        <p>If she feels the need, respect her choice to wear a mask. But she should also respect yours. Her mask should protect her sufficiently, if she believes in that stuff. But when is it going to be enough for her? Why not wear gloves, double-masks, sit 3 meters apart, pee in separate toilets, etc. It seems she has broader mental health/psychological issues, if she feels even threatened by siblings. This is really an extreme case, even for maskers. </p>
<p>Good luck. Know that the truth is a big divider, and covid is all about believing or not-believing in it. There is no real middle-way.  </p>

        <p>The spirit of fear is not of the Lord. It makes me so sad that the master deceiver has his grip over her. She‚Äôs recently renounced her faith altogether as well, along with struggling with other psychological issues. It is sad. I do hope the normalization of not wearing a mask will be enough to make her fear less</p>

        <p>There you have the problem right there. She's lost her anchor, her faith, which can leave a person drifting. That is exactly the case on a population level. No more idea of understanding what is the truth, the right way, and then all kinds of delusions can get a hold on you. </p>
<p>Seems you know the Bible well, that's going to be your biggest ally in the years to come, to prepare you in truth and spirit. I will say a prayer for you and your sister. Stay patient, don't give up on her. But don't get sucked in the delusions either. Somebody needs to keep a foot in reality in your household. God bless, and again good luck.</p>

        <p>This is tough, especially because you are correct.  People with high anxiety need help and they need support.  I have experience here.  Your brainwashed sister doesn‚Äôt need antagonism.</p>
<p>What can you do to help her through this?  Is anybody helping her through this or is everyone just masking up all the time?</p>
<p>Ultimately it‚Äôs going to come down to her realizing fresh air is not going to kill her.  Does your family eat dinner together?  Do you do anything outside together?  Swim?  Other things that are impossible to do with a mask?</p>
<p>While she progresses down that slow road, if you can‚Äôt be supportive you should probably just stay away from her as much as possible.</p>

        <p>She isn‚Äôt afraid of being around us without a mask, but she would be if I went about life mask less. You‚Äôre right though, and I antagonized her yesterday which ended up in a blowout. I want to find a way to help her without compromising on my strong beliefs. Any suggestions? Is compromise the short term answer? I‚Äôm starting to think so</p>

        <p>Your parents seem like they are very concerned about your sister, and probably not even regarding the mask, but taking it out on you since you are more stable and able to handle it. </p>
<p>You don‚Äôt want to end up causing some permanent rift with your family over a mask. Just tell your sister that you are willing to wear the mask a little longer, but she will also need to make the effort to determine a realistic point that you can get back to normal. </p>
<p>If you aren‚Äôt entirely happy and she‚Äôs not entirely happy about the outcome, the compromise worked ;)</p>

        <p>Geez. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with that. So disturbing the amount of people who have completely abandoned logic. I get being cautious due to working in a nursing home... but the whole mask narrative is that it PrOtEcTs OtHeRs, NoT YoU, so they keep obliterating their own argument by being scared to not wear one in public now. I was immediately concerned with your sister‚Äôs mental health when I read the end of your post, if her mental health is determined by your decision to wear, or not to wear a mask. Why can‚Äôt she just stay away from you if it bothers her that much? And I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre a minor if there‚Äôs a chance they‚Äôll try to ‚Äúmake you‚Äù get vaccinated. I wouldn‚Äôt normally encourage leaving your parents‚Äô home, but I absolutely get why you would in that case. Yeah sounds like an upsetting situation.</p>
