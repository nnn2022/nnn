        <p>I believe this is a test as well. Satan and his henchmen are fooling the masses, and God is allowing it to happen, because it separates His flock from the chaff. Covid is one of the Great Delusions. </p>
<p>2 Thessalonians 2:9-12
Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.</p>
<p>And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</p>

        <p>I look at it this way. I believe in God/Jesus and Heaven/Hell. So my theory is our short time on earth is a testing ground to see if we are worthy for Heaven. Life is not supposed to be easy (everyone will suffer at times in their life) and we are constantly tempted but at the end of the day, God gives us free will. Unfortunately, most people will not get into Heaven - even many that think they will. It’s hard to stay on the right path when sin and temptations are thrown at you 24/7 on this earth (Lucifers playground). It’s a test to see if you were able to stand firm in your faith and trust God in your darkest times. Similar to how the Freemasons use the lower levels to weed out individuals. Only those they deem worth are able to reach the 33rd degree (enlightenment) where they are taught the “truth” about esoteric occultist teaching which is Lucifer is God and God is evil.</p>
<p>I look around and see that God/Jesus has been removed from almost everything these days. If you look at revelation and what’s going on in the world, it makes you wonder if we might be headed towards the end times. The end times will be the NWO/Great Reset where the whole world will unite and hold the same beliefs...this is when the Antichrist will be ushered in.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be lonely and depressing knowing what’s actually going on in the world yet nobody will listen. Most people will call you crazy, delusional, religious freak, etc - when in fact they’re the ones being deceived. Luckily (for now) we still have this place with like and open-minded individuals. Sometimes knowing all of this can seem like a curse because once you see it...you can never unsee it. Everything changes. </p>
<p>I feel like every time I went down the conspiracy rabbit hole it always came back to good vs evil (God vs Lucifer). We’ve been in a spiritual warfare since the moment we were born - you just can’t see it. Once you see thru the veil, the spiritual warfare becomes a lot more noticeable for the individual. If anything it has made my faith grow stronger.</p>

        <p>God didn't place us here, now. He put humans here a long time ago and gave them free reign. Humanity has screwed us over and over again. Satan isn't going to get people to follow him by admitting they'll be going to hell, he'll get more followers by convincing people there's no such thing. The Bible warns us of this but TPTB don't want us reading it.</p>

        <p>There's nothing stopping you from reading the Bible anywhere. You can get it in a wide variety of different formats (ebook, audiobook, physical copy), often for free. They're still in hotels. It just can't be taught in public school or have laws passed based on it. You wouldn't want any other religion to have that ability with their sacred text, right?</p>

        <p>Just because something is available doesn't mean they want you reading it. They've done a bang up job convincing the majority of humans that there is no God. People that didn't grow up religious, but would have maybe found their way there, are less likely to want to look into religion after they have been brainwashed their entire lives by people trying to convince them there's no point. If you look for the signs, they are everywhere. You have to want to see it. Once your eyes are open, you will understand what i mean. For the people that will say growing up religious is brainwashing, i simply meant that for many years now we have been seeing anti-religion propaganda. How many shows/movies can you count that openly talk about God and faith? How many can you count that use God's name in vain and promote sinful ways?</p>

        <p>Other than when i brought up the bible, i don't think i mentioned christianity. All religions believe in a God. God doesn't want us believing in different religions, he wants us to believe in Him. I don't want media shoving religion down people's throats, I want to see them promoting good behaviour and kindness. We have been desensitized into thinking, not only that bad behaviour is funny and will get a laugh, but also that there is no harm in it. You can have a sense of humour without talking badly about God/religion, or being sinful in any way.</p>

<p>u/PM_ME_KITTYNIPPLES, so rare that they don't exist. Jesus himself makes it clear that one's good works and self-defined morality are insufficient to warrant access to the Father. Salvation is found only in Jesus Christ - there are no alternative paths to Him. This is Christianity 101.</p>

        <p>The reason that we, as believers, have been put on this timeline is because Daddy God knows that we are the best people for the job. For example, I used to be gay and clearly see that my experiences were allowed by God because He knew that I would be the best man for the "Gays can be radically transformed by God's grace" message. </p>
<p>The fact that you can see the problem of the sheep means that you can go out to them and be a shepherd who leads them to the Greatest Shepherd. Please fight that defeated mentality and rejoice because the One in you is greater than the one in the world (1 Jn 4:4).</p>

        <p>God didn't put you here, if he did then you should probably reconsider your reverence of him, so it is better not to attribute the current fuckery you find yourself in as being a test of God's. Your parents' and grandparents' generations did this to you.</p>
