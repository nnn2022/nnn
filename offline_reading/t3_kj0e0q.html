        <p>If the Gateses and the Faucis and the representatives of the international medical establishment get their way, life will not return to normal until the entire planet is vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. What many do not yet understand, however, is that the vaccines that are being developed for SARS-Cov-2 are unlike any vaccines that have ever been used on the human population before. And, as radically different as these vaccines appear, they represent only the very beginning of a complete transformation of vaccine technology that is currently taking place in research labs across the planet. This is a study of The Future of Vaccines.</p>

        <p>Interesting video. But I believe the entire thing is a psychological operation. </p>
<p>They control both sides of every public argument. That's why people like Alex Jones, David Icke etc. exist and are such large names in this. They're meant to look unhinged and ridiculous.</p>
<p>Making everyone worry about a vaccine(which is a legitimate worry) and then have it not be dangerous at all will help enforce the anti-antivaxxer sentiment, which is a more valuable result. </p>
<p>I think there will be mild side effects but not much more. Some people may develop allergies which will not be linked to vaccines etc.. <br>
I don't think they're going to risk the first wave being a mass murder or sterilization. This would be too obvious and people would turn against it.</p>
<p>It seems clear the goal is to have not only the coronavirus vaccines coming in soon, but other vaccines as well. Just today I read something about a cancer vaccine which of course will be as fake as any other. </p>
<p>Of course limitations for non-vaccinated people will be a thing. They're trying to vilify antivaxxers similarly to how they do nazis or fundamentally religious people.<br>
Similar to how if you criticize Israel you're automatically a nazi, if you have any concerns at all about vaccines you're being labeled an antivaxxer.<br>
They won't even have to do most of the policing themselves. 
See any "national socialist" protest or gathering and count the amounts of people protesting against the violent anti-protestors(antifa and such). The counter-protest is always significantly larger and more violent.<br>
Of course all these movements are just controlled oppositions anyway, just regular people getting caught up in another layer of the made up reality we all live in.</p>
<p>It's not unlikely being an antivaxxer or even unvaccinated will be basically illegal in the future under the guise of "being dangerous". It's probable there will be a lot of made up crimes by antivaxxers in the future to reinforce this belief.</p>

        <p>There's quite a lot of them out there and I suspect even some of the doctors publicly questioning are controlled opposition.  They also put out a lot of false paths out there and rabbit holes for people to fall into and these serve to divert people, divide people, and ultimately discredit anyone questioning the narratives.  The psychological operations are quite sophisticated these days. People should be very careful about the people they are following and the messages they are putting out.  Keep your shilldar on at all times and do not fall into cult of personality traps</p>

        <p>i agree with what you say, cv19 vaccine is not necessarily gonna be a disaster</p>
<p>but as you mention there is a big chance non-vaccinated will experience restrictions of freedom in some countries</p>
<p>this (basically forced) mrna vaccine is simply a precedent. just like the governmental covid tracing apps. this is all just to set a precedent. these things are sorta harmless yet, bit the next pandemic or catastrophe will set a push for all horroble things like quantum dot tattoos and forced vaccines with potential sterilization features and privacy breaching forced tracking apps. iirc thats what corbett saus here</p>
