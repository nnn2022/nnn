        <p>&rt;Stew Peters talked with Dr. David Martin in an <strong>historical</strong> interview with <strong>inarguable</strong> fact-based exposure that should be seen by the <strong>entire</strong> world as an <strong>absolute</strong> end to the COVID narrative.</p>
<p>Is he aiming for some sort of hyperbole award? Headlines Like this automatically make me less likely to trust a source - I don't discard them, but generally its not a sign of rigorous, unemotional analysis.</p>
<p>&rt;When you inject a known toxin into a person you are actually injecting an agent of death...you know that it is in fact lethal in many cases.</p>
<p>Just pointing out that harmful toxins such as arsenic are used to treat some serious illnesses (e.g. promyelocytic leukemia). This doesn't mean his conclusion is wrong, just that you have to be clear that it <strong>only</strong> has a toxic effect. If it also has a beneficial effect they have to be weighed against one another depending on the context.</p>
<p>I'd like to examine what he has to say but 50 minute videos aren't an option for me when I can read the equivalent amount of text in 5 minutes. If anyone has a link to an article covering his views I would appreciate it.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this! It's quite complex and outside by depth of legal knowledge, however, there are some areas where I feel he is making claims that could be easily challenged by an opposing legal team. Just as an example, on page 4:</p>
<p>&rt;In the 1905 Jacobson v. Mass case, the court was clear that a PUBLIC BENEFIT was required for a vaccine to be mandated. Neither Pfizer nor Moderna have proved a disruption of transmission.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The Moderna and Pfizer “alleged vaccine” trials have explicitly acknowledged that their gene therapy technology has no impact on viral infection or transmission whatsoever and merely conveys to the recipient the capacity to produce an S1 spike protein...</p>
<p>There are studies (not necessarily ones that I would wholeheartedly trust) that claim that the vaccines reduce viral load and thus transmission, e.g. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0607-mrna-reduce-risks.html">this from the CDC</a>. With counters like this a well-funded legal team could keep something like this in the courts (if it got that far) for years. I think there is certainly stuff within this document worth pursuing regarding Fauci's involvement with the virus and vaccines but I think the argument needs to be finessed and, even then, without the support and assistance of prominent or well-connected journalists I don't think it will gain much traction.</p>
