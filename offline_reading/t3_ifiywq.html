    <strong>Woman Taunted and Ridiculed for Being Removed from Plane over Mask Requirement</strong>
    <p><p>Have you folks seen the popular WCGW <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Whatcouldgowrong/comments/ife85w/wcgw_refusing_to_wear_a_mask_on_a_plane/">video</a> about the woman refusing to wear a mask on a plane?  I don't know what all led up to the situation, but the whole post and comments section was pretty disturbing to me.  Basically the woman was removed and the comments section are, as you would expect, vicious insults directed at the woman.  It's presented as if it is some kind of victory against her supposed ignorance.  </p>
<p>The evidence on masks as I've seen it is pretty controversial and not set in stone as people are acting.  Breathing would at the very least cause the virons to travel through the fabric, so at best it might reduce the quantity of virons that make it through and the distance in which it travels.  So maybe it helps or maybe it doesn't, and the most convincing evidence I've seen suggests that humidity is the biggest transmitter. </p>
<p>But, if you are all wearing masks and sitting right next to each other in a plane, it would still be spreading through and getting lots of people infected, and so it wouldn't make sense to be on the plane anyway if you are afraid enough to the virus as they seem to be.  Right?  These people aren't exactly social distancing.  </p>
<p>However, for the sake of argument let's say that wearing a mask was set in stone as effective, and you can be right next to someone and it not be a problem.  Is this any way to treat a fellow human being?  These people clapping all assume that they are more intelligent, and better people in general, and that the woman is crazy.  But if they think she is crazy, then adding humiliation would worsen her mental state of mind.  That would seem cruel and the wrong way to treat a fellow citizen.  Being cruel to someone having a humiliating or traumatic experience, even if you disagree with something they did, is a sign of weak moral character.</p>
<p>For the record, I do not think the woman refusing to wear the mask is crazy or make any assumptions about her.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I respect her right to decide what she believes.  The people taunting her and the comments come from a place of bullying and immature thinking.  </p>
<p>Anyways, just wanted to bring this up for discussion and spitball some thoughts on here.</p></p>

        <p>The people mocking her are morally and ethically bankrupt.</p>
<p>As you say, they think they're better than her - and then they mock her supposed "stupidity and ignorance". This is literally "punching down", bullying. These people are frothing at the mouth to attack anyone they think is beneath them. They'd have been the first people to throw rocks at Jewish children at the start of Nazi Germany. </p>
<p>(For the record, I also never and will never wear a mask).</p>

        <p>Yeah, the hypocrisy bugs me. The culture from which this comes from talks about being tolerant, accepting, understanding, but in practice it just looks like narcassism.</p>

        <p>They assaulted her and they should be charged with assault.   A civil lawsuit would be in order as well.</p>
