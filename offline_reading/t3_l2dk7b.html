    <strong>Social Media Is The Real Virus</strong>
    <p><p>If this fucking pitiful pussy of a virus with a 99.7% survival rate had come along less than ten years ago, none of this draconian, dystopian bullshit would have ever happened. But because every retarded, sponge-brained, solipsistic fuck-face can just scat their fucking pathetic, uneducated opinions the moment they enter their head to social media where their fellow cousin-fucking troglodytes see, share and spread it we find ourselves in this fucking absolute CLOWN WORLD, where empathy equals letting people lose their livelihoods, starve, and ultimately die alone, breathing out their last surrounded by nurses twerking for Tik Tok, to save some decrepit Crypt Keeper looking fuck who probably lived through the fucking 1918 flu pandemic and give them a few more months of life: something which surely must be fucking agony at their age.</p>
<p>Our society rewards and applauds narcissism and virtue-signaling. Social media is a fucking breeding ground for both. A fucking petri dish of preening twats and patronizing Instawhores screeching "sAvE gRaNdMa!!" through their tear-stained, BLM-embroidered face-diaper. These are the same worthless, drain-on-society fucks liable to attend grandma's funeral and take selfies at the open casket, duck-facing with a fucking dog filter applied. But sure, we're the real sociopaths, guys, for, FUCKING GASP, wanting to see our families and friends!?! For wanting this dystopia to end!? For questioning the extremely shaky narrative!? How could we?! </p>
<p>Humanity and morality is becoming depressingly warped and twisted beyond recognition and social media is to blame. Some genderless fucking alien with a blue check mark next to their name who's carved out a tiny, little nub of internet for themselves shits out a tweet and their fucking devoted followers pounce on it like bug-eyed piranhas at a feeding frenzy, mashing the like button as fast as their fat fucking sausage fingers can. They probably don't even read whatever it is the fuck they're agreeing with. That's how brainwashed these fucks are.</p>
<p>I am so fucking fed up of it all. I can't handle the stupidity. The narcissism. The absolute bum-licking and ball-fondling going on is just fucking hands down the most ridiculous thing that's ever happened on this diseased fucking rock we call a planet. You are not a fucking hero for strapping a piece of fabric to your face and demanding others to do the same so YOU feel safe. You are not a fucking hero for bunkering down in your parents' basement for a year, quivering and shivering like a shitting dog, whilst others go homeless and starve. You are not a fucking hero for throwing a hissy fit whenever you see someone outside walking down an empty pavement maskless, daring to live their life, instead of merely surviving in a perpetual state of fear like you do. On that note, I've fucking had enough of you dickheads calling people "Karens", too: YOU ARE THE FUCKING KARENS, HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE THAT?!</p>
<p>By the way, your grandparents probably fucking HATE your guts. Maybe not consciously, but I'm sure some pure black resentment has built up over the past few months of being denied human contact by you patronizing, finger-wagging arseholes. There's some fucking darkness coming for you all, some right fucking NASTY family drama, I fucking guarantee it. I hope the fucking Internet points were worth it, though, you sanctimonious, robot fucks. </p>
<p>If I wasn't so fucking furious with you retarded, doomer bat-wings I'd laugh myself hoarse. You've been fed a cement mixer full of rancid spunk and liquid dookie and you've greedily gulped down every last drop and asked for more like a fucking skivvy, cap in hand and licking your fucking collagen injected lips, fucking salivating for the next juicy morsel of COVID goss. This virus has not been worth the seismic fucking shift in how we go about our lives. What fucking defect makes you so obsessed with the fucking minutiae of such a BORING fucking virus to the extent you've gone a full fucking year talking about it DAILY is beyond my fucking comprehension. You fucking idiots have spoiled a good thing we had going, you know? But whatever, it's done. We're done. You won't stop until masks are permanent. You won't stop until human contact has been rendered a distant, sepia-tinged memory. You won't stop until everyone's had the vaccine raped into them.</p></p>

        <p>Social media truly has allowed the mass brainwashing.</p>
<p>This wouldn’t have been possible even 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Yet when the MSM speaks with one voice and twitter and fb algorithms heavily skew information towards doom porn...the younger generation cannot discern what is real any longer.</p>
<p>Truly pathetic.</p>
<p>Can you imagine what human beings even 200 years ago would have thought of the absolute morons today?</p>

<p>People in the Victorian era lived through things like cholera epidemics that took out 15% of the population in some cities. They took smallpox vaccines with a 2-3% fatality rate because the disease killed 1 in 4 children it infected.</p>
<p>They would laugh in our face for shutting down the world due to something now universally agreed to have a mortality rate of 0.1-0.3%.</p>

        <p>You see I don't think it is socialist the definition of that word is as follows...</p>
<p><strong>Socialism:</strong> An umbrella term used to describe social ownership of the means of production. Social ownership can include common ownership, state ownership or collective ownership. "Socialism" can also refer to an intermediate and transitional form of society between capitalism and communism featuring a Dictatorship of the Proletariat (sometimes referred to as "lower" or "the first phase of" communism). Keep in mind this means dictatorship for the proliferate not the gorgeous</p>
<p>I live in Canada and when iI asked if we were a socialist nation on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/socailsism/">r/socailsism</a> they told me we are welfare capitalists keep take that how you will.</p>
<p>I can see how Canadas public health insurance being socialist in nature even if we are still a capitalist society(one of the reasons police don't care about the charter not all but some not@poliuceongaurdforthee)</p>
<p>one more thing this is a quote from George Orwell you know everyone loves 1984 in this sub but does everyone know Eric was a police officer in his early life in berma also this is a good quote from him</p>
<p>When one came (to Barcelona) straight from England the aspect of Barcelona was somewhat startling and overwhelming. It was the first time that I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle……. In outward appearance, it was a town in which the wealthy classes had practically ceased to exist. Except for a small number of women and foreigners, there were no ’well-dressed’ people at all. Practically everyone wore rough working-class clothes, or blue overalls, or some variant of the militia uniform. All this was queer and moving. There was much in it that I did not understand, in some ways I did not even like it, but I recognized it immediately as a state of affairs worth fighting for”."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/orwell/1938/homage-catalonia.htm">https://www.marxists.org/archive/orwell/1938/homage-catalonia.htm</a> full version</p>
<p>I feel like we really don't know what we were fighting nowadays sometimes we feel communism sometimes it feels/but at the core of it we're fighting in our countries right now has to have some type of Capitalism things as well at least the North American countries</p>
<p>I think these-ists in these isms'bring us apart because the truth is there is a modicum of logic and truth in all of them may be the problem is the people that we've had in charge of these theories may be the problem is that we are so blind to this versus that that we can't step back and mix all the good parts of them to together maybe it's because there's not enough incentive to do that because well that would make not money</p>

        <p>My thoughts articulated perfectly. Narratives and agendas are pushed from the top-down, hits the blue ticks and psychologically the masses follow suit as blue ticks are considered influential. Social media is a stain where soon nobody will be able to form their own opinion and instead follow the narrative of what is deemed the most virtuous or which will gather them the most likes.</p>
<p>There's an episode of Black Mirror where everyone's walking around in this fake-ass world liking/rating each other. That's what life will become.</p>

        <p>I agree. Social media is a dangerous technology that can be easily weaponized and should be treated as such. It’s much more of a threat to our wellbeing than nuclear bombs are at this point. I don’t know why more people can’t see this. </p>

        <p>Social media is extremely dangerous. Not only is it severely addictive by design, but it changes the way that people think. It makes us more narcissistic, it ruins our ability to focus, and makes people be obedient little followers who are deathly afraid of downvotes or a mean tweet. Children should have no access to it until they're at least 18, and adults should use it sparingly and with caution.</p>
