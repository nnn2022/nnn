    <p><p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I'm not out to convince anyone what or what not to believe in, I'm yet to be convinced as there are good&amp;bad points being made by both/all 'sides'!</p>
<p>My main thing is that I want people to recognize that we all have more things in common than things that divide us! There are people that are afraid of the virus and we have to respect that, there are people that fear for their financial existence and we have to respect that, and there are people that are afraid of the government's power over their freedom and we have to respect that as well! </p>
<p>Of course all sides have stupid people (just go to the subreddits of either side for examples), but apart from those few that often generate the most hype, the rest of us are just 'normal' people, fearing for some part of their lives and wanting their normal lives back.</p>
<p>I just want us all to hear each other out! I suppose most of us have the intelligence to block out those stupid and non-sensical posts&amp;comments, but for the rest, just take time to listen to the other perspective and try to put yourself in those shoes.</p>
<p>A really nice quote by a buddhist teacher (Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh) says 'You are only partly right'. If you really think about it, it's not that easy to live by. But if we all acconplish it, the dialogue will be much healthier and we will all truly feel that we are in this all together! Even for scientific stuff, this quote applies. Science is constantly changing and there is NEVER 100% certainty, that's why it's important to hear out all sides as 'we are all only partly right!', even scientists!! </p>
<p>I'm definitely no full-on believer and truster of everything the government or science put out (via media), I just want us to accept each others' fears and be united in the search for solutions to everyone's problems!</p>

<p>Here I have a short Joe Rogan vid of his most recent podcast episode. It's just 10-ish minutes long and he is just talking about being critical &amp; fed up of some measures. I respect him as he has quite an open perspective on many different things in life, still it kinda suprised me how he talked about it. And it led me to write all of this, dont really know whyüòÖ</p>
<p>And keep in mind "You are only partly right"! Not just relating to Covid but for everythingüòÅ</p></p>

        <p>Here's the problem.</p>
<p>One side has the government forcing everyone to do what they think is right. You aren't given the option to act if you disagree</p>

        <p>I respect peoples' fear. What I don't respect is the way they put on airs about being selfless heroes when all they've really done is force dozens of gig economy workers to shoulder the risk for them. Then they shit on those workers for trying to do something other than service their needs, and they think this makes them morally unimpeachable! Utterly sickening behaviour.</p>
