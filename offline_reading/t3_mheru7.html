    <p><p><strong>I don’t have to give a reason.</strong></p>
<p>I don’t owe anybody an explanation as to why I’m not getting a medical treatment. </p>
<p>It’s nobody’s business and they are not entitled to know anything about my decision. It is my BODY and MY medical history. End of story.</p>

        <p>I probably would've gotten it if they had cut out all the bullshit from the start. But no, right from the beginning it's been nonstop propaganda.</p>
<p>Something as simple as "Hey, we've got a vaccine available, we don't know how long its effective for, it's got some pretty nasty side effects, but it's there if you want it," would've sufficed.</p>
<p>No, instead we turned it into a dick waving contest. We have to constantly one up the other and make ourselves look better than those of us who opted not to get the jab. </p>
<p>And on the propaganda front, it's not even just news outlets anymore. It's word of mouth advertising and individuals shilling for the pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>Idk where to turn anymore. Everyone I know has either gotten it or is planning to get it. Even people I would least expect to fall for this garbage. </p>
<p>However, in a shocking turn of events, my mother has opted out of it despite (or perhaps as a result of) her comorbidities. I can't give her too much credit though because she's been freaking out over Covid since Day 1, and is an obedient servent paying close attention to the orders of Lord Fuaci. I just think she's afraid that the vaccine will put the nail in her coffin</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant</p>

        <p>I’m with you, everyone around me is getting or has gotten it, it seems. I don’t care though. I realize that no one is necessarily pressuring me but it feels that way... like that societal pressure to get married, have kids, etc. by a certain time and if not, people start asking. Anyway, rant away. It’s okay to decline the vaccine no matter WHAT any of these virtue signalers say. The vaccine doesn’t get rid of Covid, it just protects the individual so no one should care whether or not anyone else gets it. Too many morons.</p>

        <p>No need to apologize. I'm glad to hear that I'm not alone. Your story sounds almost the same as mine. I live in a state almost exclusively populated by Fuaci worshipping sheep. My mom has always been a puppet of government propaganda but my dad always tought me to be weary of government and world powers. But suddenly over covid my dad became an obedient sheep. They both jumped on getting the jab, thankfully neither of them reacted badly to it and they are old enough that the long term side effects aren't to much to worry about. I'm lucky that they aren't pressuring me to take it but my work sure as hell is. I work as a cna caregiver so I've qualified to get the shot right from the start so I've had to deal with people telling me to take it this entire time. The pressure only makes me dig my heels in deeper every day. It's just such a relief to be able to talk to like minded people on here.</p>

        <p>I'm 100% with you pal. It's quite shocking what's happened to people here, (UK). Met an old friend the other day for a walk and the first thing he said was, happily " I got my jab last week!" and when I said I hadn't he became visibly hesitant about our proximity. Fucking shame. Someone else 'jokingly' referred to me as a super spreader. Just...unbelievable.</p>

        <p>Tbh, I have no idea what she wants. My father got it under the guise of being able to return to normal, even though my mother will have no part of that. She's strictly forbidding people from entering their home, and pretty much refuses to leave the house. </p>
<p>I think she's going to die this way. Which is sad because when she recieved her cancer diagnosis in Dec 2018, she was told she had 12-16 months to live. She said she would make the most of her time left on earth, but when the lockdowns hit 1 year later, she quickly locked down and more or less turned into a hermit. </p>
<p>She's wanted to go to Ireland all her life, and cancelled plans to go because her doctor and the guv'ment said so. She limits who visits her, and the only time I can visit is if we go for short walks in the freezing cold since I'm not allowed inside. She's fucking miserable but she won't disobey guv'ment orders. The fear mongering and propaganda has succeeded in brainwashing her.</p>

        <p>Is it really because of the government or the fact that she understands how vulnerable she is having been diagnosed with cancer not many years ago and literally being given a timeline to expect to die by? Her immune system is not going to be as strong as it was before developing cancer. This virus kills at an unprecedented rate. Those two facts make this a difficult situation, especially for people who fell like they have to be extremely careful of their decisions, even if it means keeping loved ones at a distance, just to be able have more conversations with the same people they are starting away from. But you're right, it's the government's fault. /s</p>
<p>Honestly, take a look at what New Zealand has done in response compared to most countries. They had the infrastructure to be able to take the measures they did and they had, and still have, the right idea about how to approach a global pandemic. Your mother is doing thing same but on a much smaller scale. But you're right, it's the fear mongering and propaganda that for the best of her /s</p>

        <p>Even accounting for age and comorbidities, she has a ~65% chance of surviving Covid. The brain cancer is 15%, and dwindles exponentially for every year she lives</p>
<p>And let's set the record straight: Covid is not killing people at "Unprecedented rates". Heart disease and cancer are far more letha</p>
<p>I'm familiar with New Zealand's infrastructure. Could you please elaborate?</p>

        <p>You knew the rate at which Covid would kill right from the onset?  I'm impressed. Except you didn't. It was "unprecedented." Thanks for taking a moment to think about it.  </p>
<p>New Zealand is in the likes of having their society up and running, with the exception of tourism. I thought you would have understood the relation between shutting society down, keeping people at home for an extended time, a government actually trying to support them, all with idea of being able to move on like we all want to sooner rather than later. Crazy, right?</p>

        <p>Amen.  They're not telling you that there's already evidence of widespread natural immunity/antibodies in the population.  They're not telling you that having the common cold confers immunity from covid.  In short, they're doing everything they can to make it look like the vaccine is your only option and that you should be condemned and shunned for not getting it as you pose a danger to others.  </p>
<p>Also, if the vaccines are 95% effective, anyone who has it should be able to shut their neurotic hypochondriac mouths about the vaccinated status of anyone around them.</p>

        <p>They actually claim all vaccines are close to 100% effective to stop ICU hospitalizations, which is the whole point of "flattening the curve".</p>
<p>Still, there are 2 main arguments why they want everyone vaccinated:</p>
<ol>
<li>Because not everyone can take the vaccine (eg: people with severe allergies) and they want these people to be protected too. These can only be protected through herd immunity.</li>
<li>Because they are afraid the antibodies from the vaccine will expire and they will be vulnerable again. For them, this can be avoided through herd immunity before the antibodies expire.</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, they want everyone to take the vaccine because they want to eradicate the virus from the planet. It is a very big wishful thinking when not every country is vaccinating right now and the borders will be reopened eventually (thus why they want covid passports: to not let those minorities go to their country). Also, the virus is too well engineered to just disappear: vaccine-immune mutations will be the ones spreading eventually, like any normal flu virus. But, they got very high optimism.</p>

        <p>This virus is not deadly enough for enough of the population to warrant everyone needing to get the vaccine.  Young and healthy people are more than capable of fending it off, should they choose, with their own immune system and developing natural immunity.  All the lockdowns have accomplished is preventing this widespread immunological response.  It's so counter-intuitive, so irrational, that one cannot help that it feels intentional.</p>

        <p>During the height of the pandemic I donated blood and received a call that I was a candidate to potentially have a higher immunity to Covid than others. They wanted more blood / plasma to experiment with for a vaccine. I didn’t mind one bit; sure for the better of humanity. 
Until I got the paperwork - under the terms and conditions they could clone my dna. This was the exact reason why I didn’t donate my son’s umbilical cord a few months prior.</p>

        <p>Plus we're not dealing with a deadly virus (keeping in mind that you aren't over 70 with multiple comorbidities) and even then there is safer treatment options, we've seen several reports of side effects, deaths happening all around the world. With everything of this scamdemic being a lie, there is a place I draw the line and it's when something is forced upon me as this poison is being done, fuck them and the doomers can pound sand ffs</p>

        <p>IMO, if anyone doesn't want to take the vaccine, they shouldn't be coerced into taking it.</p>
<p>When asked why I don't want to take the vaccine by a person who has taken the vaccine, I will simply respond by thanking them for taking part in what is probably the largest vaccine study ever conducted on the planet, but that I prefer to be a part of the control group of the study.</p>

        <p>The vaccine rollout is proof that the people in charge (politicians and public health bureaucrats) have worked a day in their lives. You don't sell a product by begging people to take it and then threatening and insulting them if they don't. You sell a product by making it sound edgy and scarce. </p>
<p>Now that it's clear a solid block of America will not be taking it, the powers that be have resorted to name-calling and attempts at public shaming. They're the most incompetent bunch of assholes outside of the NY Jets front office. </p>
<p>And none of this has anything to do with The Science©. The mRNA platform is new and promising and I hope there's lots of effective therapeutics to follow. But this particular product for this particular pathogen? No.</p>

<p>I am so sick of people asking "why" not because they are curious about your experience, but only because they want to contradict you. Truth is, all these people acting like they are such selfless people who care about everyone's healthy ACTUALLY just got the vaccine for their own self-interest.

        <p>That's not actually "clearly" the case since the risks of the COVID vaccines are still undetermined at this point. </p>
<p>Your argument is that anything calling itself a vaccine must be safe. That's fallacious. Whether it is safer to get the vaccine than not to get the vaccine is a different argument, one we'll probably also disagree with but you've got a way to go before that's even relevant.</p>
<p>My testing on the COVID vaccines will conclude about 20 years from now.</p>

        <p>Okay well nothing gets tested for 20 years before coming to market. All the other vaccines and drugs you’ve taken have gone through similar processes to be fda approved. People take the speed at which it happened as proof that it hasn’t been properly vetted but that’s not the case. The same standards as far as quality control and number of participants were applied to the Covid vaccine.

<p>This kind of obvious lie is one of the many reasons I don't trust you people. long-term side effects have not been studied. There hasn't been enough time. Try again. </p>
<p>No children have been born to people who've taken these vaccines. Very little time has passed between when they were created and the present. I'm waiting until children born to people who've taken the vaccine have children of their own. What you do with your body is your business. Stay out of mine.</p>
