    <strong>I should not have to be dragged into this</strong>
    <p><p>Injecting a bunch of foreign substances into my body is literally everything I try to avoid in my life. I live my life in an extremely healthy manner. I eat an extremely strict and healthy diet, and rarely consume things with much more than 5 ingredients. This contributes to the fact that I consider myself to be in extremely good health, and most importantly, with a strong immune system. Now this is the way I have personally chosen to live as it makes my life individually fulfilling. </p>
<p>Therefore I would like to reserve the right to be the master of my own body and assert that I have the ability to withstand a virus with close to 100% survivability in my age group. A virus which most of all can be compared more to the common cold, than anything else if I were to get it. </p>
<p>I fully respect people's choice to take a vaccine if they feel themselves to be in danger or perhaps even out of compassion. But since I have literally prepared my body for situations like these much of my life, I would deem it exponentially scary that I have to explain why it is an extremely dangerous precedent we are setting right now. A precedent which means that perfectly healthy individuals should have to take this more or less experimental injection of foreign substances, in order to win back basic freedoms. </p>
<p>Filling my body with unnatural compounds is literally what I'm most aware of avoiding in my life. I don’t care if these chemicals are legal, ‘’healthy’’ or supposedly harmless. I don't care if these unnatural compounds come in the form of cosmetics, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, hormones, hand sanitizer, medicine or vaccines. I strive to live a natural and healthy life. I realize that living this way is probably crazy to a lot of people and that most people don’t have these values, and therefore they might feel the need to take an injection like this. That's understandable, and you can do what you want with your life and body, but I beg you to stop supporting the fact that everyone should have the exact same values and ideas of what healthy life consists of. Do what you want with your body, but don’t drag me into your life choices.</p></p>

        <p>This is exactly what this should be about, choice. The governments use of vaccine passports etc to put undue pressure on those not wanting to and for that matter actual not needing to take it is despicable and leads me to believe that there is a hidden agenda behind this and has nothing to do with the “safety of others” that they keep bleating on about ... those that fall into the very low risk category be-it through age or fitness levels etc they should be allowed to go about their lives without this hanging over them ... only once those that are in the my government loves me camp become alert to this nonsense will we be free, there are far too many that think like this still which saddens me massively</p>

<p>I never signed up for any of this nonsense.  I've lived more or less a healthy life.  I continue to make healthy life decisions.</p>
<p>One of the healthy life decisions I will be making, is not getting Experimental Gene Therapy done to my body to potentially protect against a virus from which I have well over a 99% recovery rate.</p>

        <p>I work in the food industry. You shouldnt be scared of a long label. “Clean label” is a marketing tool. The dose makes the poison when it comes to eating things that arent good for us. </p>
<p>That being said, im not taking the “vaccine” either. I try to eat healthy and workout everyday so my body can do the work for me. I agree we should all have a choice.</p>

        <p>That makes sense yea, but I actually did not mean it like that. I eat a very restrictive diet, where I make all my food from scratch out of whole food ingredients and rarely make dishes with more crap than neccesarry. Therefore I also always choose high quaility and organic foods, because there is no way things like roundups, pesticides, soy fed hormon filled meat etc. can be considered ''natural'', and good or neglible for our bodies.</p>
<p>For sure the dose makes the posion, that is very true!</p>

        <p>Well like I said, the dose makes the poison. There are very small trace amounts of pesticides, GMOs, etc in all that stuff. Theres nothing to be afraid of. There isnt even a big difference between “all natural” and organic anyway, again, just marketing. A lot of that stuff is used for shelf life and food safety, which is very important if we are going to feed the mass amount of people in the world. Preservatives/gums etc are made from plants, seaweed..etc..again coming from the earth so it is natural. </p>
<p>There are actual studies now that show organic food production is worse for the enviornment because they use a lot more land and water waste. Its actually very interesting. </p>
<p>There is nothing to be afraid of really. Just stay away from foods with a lot of sugar (fast food) and you will be fine with your diet.</p>

        <p>The thing is the residue on produce and other stuff you are referencing is minimal because much of it can only be shown by testing the soil which the produce is grown in. I would have to brush up on some knowledge to explain this properly, but in short you can think of it like this; Plants are living beings. They consume their nutrition from the ground they reside in. The plants become what they are grown in. If the plants are grown in soil filled with synthetic fertilzers and things like glyphosate, they will literally become these things (well not literally but you get my point). Just like us plants are what they eat.</p>
<p>Organic has definantly become a marketing ploy, but the reason it is important to look after is because it has VERY tight regulations and restrictions where you avoid the things I mentioned above.</p>
<p>You want things grown naturally and in nutritious soil, to minimize the amount of foreign substances in your body. These foreign substances are foreign (funnily enough) to your body and therefore it reacts negativly to them.</p>
<p>Think of something like aspartame which has been proven to promote cancer in large doses and is used in a lot of diet/sugar free stuff. Now do you want to put this into your body, even if its only a little tiny bit cancerous? For me thats clear evidence that these unnatrual compounds dont belong in our bodies, and I dont want them, not even just a little bit.</p>

<p>Im not trying to disrespect you, but we can always benefit from looking out beyond authority figures. There are tight regulations on our drinking water too, but that stuff is still filled with pesticides, flouride and other things we probably do not notice. </p>
<p>I'm willing to admit my reasoning may be flawed, but only if you actually show me where and why. I wont retract everything I say just because you throw down an authority card without explantion...</p>

        <p>I didn't even say I would take the vaccine, as it's not really necessary for me, I'm not at risk. Just saying you said "vaccines were always the end game" like it was some kind of sinister conspiracy and I was pointing out that all viral diseases in human history have been solved by vaccines. Now other arguments about how bad covid-19 is and the restrictions and control of freedom are separate topics. But don't act like vaccines are some kind of sinister plan.</p>

        <p>I have had other vaccinations, and I had them 1. because I was a child and didn't really have the oppertunity to object 2. because they were just that... vaccinations. This is not a vaccination in traditional sense, and Im not saying this to sound like a conspiracy nut or whatever people might call it, Im saying it because it is the truth. This vaccine might work perfectly who knows, but also it is 1. not tested long term 2. experimental in terms of the RNA function and 3. not a vaccine in traditional sense.</p>
<p>Actually vaccines are pretty straight forward. You inject a small amount of the ''poison'' you want to protect yourself against, and you body creates immunity to it. This one however is - in every sense of the word - experimental, as in it has not been done before. Therefore it is different. Also the simple fact that I am not at risk so why would I start injecting experimental stuff into my body to protect against.... nothing.</p>

        <p>It is a vaccine in a traditional sense, it is literally a vaccine. It also is not experimental, that was the trial phase, which the current vaccines all went through. You sound like a standard anti vax shill.</p>

        <p>So you are telling me have we have used RNA vaccines before in history, and at this scale?</p>
<p>That is just plain delusional and acutally a lie, and your attempt to insult me indicates that you had already made up your mind before asking me the question, so wtf is the point of you being here and asking these questions in the first place?</p>
<p>Again, I dont care what you do, take your cocktail of experimental substances as you please, just dont force it on me.</p>

        <p>Same, same, SAME! I moved to an area in the middle of nowhere so I wouldn't have fluoride in my water. I eat almost entirely organic, and work out daily. Now aside from having extreme distrust for a medical treatment being pushed by world governments, I have to explain to people why I do not want it, while they look at me like I'm the crazy one.. There's no shame in making your own health choices. You should own those choices, and be very proud of them! Much love and respect for you and the harmony you've found with your body! :)</p>
