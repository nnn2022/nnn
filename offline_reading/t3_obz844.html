        <p>I presume the CDC Foundation is something different than the CDC, which is a U.S. Government agency. But you gotta get those upvotes!</p>

        <p>It is different but works as a liaison for racketeering and brigandage related to “philanthropy”.</p>
<p>&rt;“Established by Congress as an independent, nonprofit organization, the CDC Foundation is the sole entity authorized by Congress to mobilize philanthropic partners and private-sector resources to support CDC’s critical health protection mission.”

<p>Now, the CDC itself is corrupt too.</p>
<p><strong>CDC</strong> is an outgrowth of Rockefeller’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/index.html">MCWA</a> and helps with <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2021/01/25/have-400000-americans-died-of-covid-19/">cooking the books.</a></p>
<p>CDC was involved with the <a href="https://www.history.com/news/the-infamous-40-year-tuskegee-study">Tuskegee syphilis experiment,</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-maryland-lawsuit-infections-idUSKCN1OY1N3">Guatemala syphilis experiment,</a> Swine Flu ‘76 <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/long-shadow-1976-swine-flu-vaccine-fiasco-180961994/">scam,</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/swine-flu-cases-overestimated/">Swine Flu ‘09 scams.</a></p>
<p>&rt;“CDC senior scientist: 'We trashed data showing vaccine-autism link in African-American boys'</p>
<p>&rt;“I believe we intentionally withheld controversial findings from the final draft of the Pediatrics paper.”</p>
<p>&rt;--CDC Senior Scientist Dr. William Thompson, 2014”

<p>&rt;<strong>”Portraying disease as severe, whether it is or not, is admittedly done because it helps to increase vaccine uptake.</strong> Recent CDC PowerPoint presentations ^(560) reveal this tactic with influenza, and doctors have written about it regarding pertussis as well. ^1</p>
<p>&rt;*Publicity given to the more severe consequences of whooping cough has created a widely held perception that the disease is always severe, debilitating, and dangerous. Such a perception helps to encourage immunization, but if untrue it degrades diagnostic accuracy... ^(561)</p>
<p>&rt;<em>There was the fear that this would interfere with many other forms of immunization which are far more beneficial and important to the infant. Those who expressed their disagreement with the broadcast conclusions stated that it might have the effect of increasing the incidence of death from pertussis and urged and secured publicity of opinions favoring continued use of the vaccine.</em> ^(562)”</p>
<p>&rt;*”After World War II, diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria or pneumonia no longer triggered mass fatalities in industrialized nations such as affluent America. This became a huge problem for institutions like the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the American epidemic authorities, as redundancy threatened. In 1949, a majority voted to eliminate the CDC completely. Instead of bowing out of a potentially very lucrative industry, the CDC went on an arduous search for viruses.” ^2</p>
<p>&rt;”In the United States, vaccines are actively and incessantly promoted as the solution for all infectious diseases by such government agencies as the Center for Disease Control in Georgia, by HEW, USPHS, FDA, AMA and WHO. It is of more than passing interest that the federal agencies should be such passionate supporters of compulsory use of vaccines, and that they also should go through the "revolving door" to the big drug firms whose products they have so assiduously promoted, throughout their years of service to the public. It is these federal agents who have drafted the procedures which forced the states to enact compulsory vaccination legislation which had been drafted by the attorneys for the Medical Monopoly, to become "the law of the land." In the dim reaches of the past, when Americans were more protective of their now-vanishing freedoms, there was sporadic opposition to the threatened outrage which a dictatorial central government sought to impose on every child in the United States.” ^3</p>
