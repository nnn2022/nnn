        <p>Very true, we live under a medical-dictatorship and tyrannical rules disguised as public heath orders.</p>
<p>It’s time to rise up and say enough is enough.
It’s our duty to resist tyranny using civil disobedience, protests, lawsuits, education, financial support and spreading truth any way we can.</p>

        <p>Alright</p>
<p>First of all, thank you for the first clear statement of what r/NoNewNormal really is about. Because all I've seen so far are whacky conspiracies.</p>
<p>1.
You've mentioned many downsides to lockdowns, which obviously are horrible effects on many people, myself included. But wouldn't you say that this is a sacrifice we have to make in order to save maybe another 400 000+ people? To put this in perspective again, these are more than all the americans that died in WW2.</p>
<p>2.
Have you ever considered, that maybe people like the ones that I have seen on this exact subreddit, who have ignored regulations and precautions from day one, are the reason that vaccinations and lockdowns are still very much necessary? Because I'm thinking that the only reason we're still having those problems you mentioned are people just like yourself.</p>
<p>3.
Even if you were somehow to be right, it's no use. There is no way that our governments ever allow for everything to just be ignored. So without any effect, your protesting will just lead to more infections, more deaths, and even longer lockdowns.</p>
<p>Goodbye and reconsider your opinion please</p>

<p>Nope. Not even a little bit. </p>
<p>The lockdowns have never been necessary.  If we actually wanted to end this virus sooner, we should have had as many people infected as possible to reach herd immunity.  They should have let those who aren’t at risk simply catch, and get over the virus while those who are in danger stay home. </p>
<p>Point number 3, our government has far less control and power then you think.  Hell remember when a bunch of completely unarmed buffoons quite literally took and occupied the capital building in January.</p>
<p>Lockdowns and other regulations only work if people enforce them, and as a society we agree obey them. Look at legalized marijuana.</p>

        <p>Are you a virologist?</p>
<p>Because for as far as I know getting too many people infected at once will lead to overloaded intensive care units and thereby to more deaths (this is what in italy last March if you remember).</p>
<p>And if you want to reach herd immunity, why would you be against vaccinations?</p>

        <p>Yes it would lead to more deaths.  Although with a 99.7% survival rate, most of those getting it in my hypothetical scenario would make it. Besides the old and weak. </p>
<p>This virus was going to kill the elderly and ill regardless of what we did.... like most diseases that have existed throughout history. </p>
<p>I’m actually not against vaccinations. I got the vaccine myself.  I’ve had no complications from it either.  I think that part of this sub is a bit off the deep end.</p>

        <p>The off-the-deep-end parts of this sub are mostly well justified. I'm guessing you've heard of event 201, which had the elites "simulate" a coronavirus pandemic five months before the coronavirus pandemic. Johns Hopkins was one of the organisations behind that:</p>
<p>&rt;Event 201 was a 3.5-hour <strong>pandemic tabletop exercise</strong> that simulated a series of dramatic, scenario-based facilitated discussions, confronting difficult, true-to-life dilemmas associated with response to a <strong>hypothetical, but scientifically plausible, pandemic</strong>. 15 global business, government, and public health leaders were <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/players/index.html">players</a> in the simulation exercise that highlighted unresolved real-world policy and economic issues that could be solved with sufficient political will, financial investment, and attention now and in the future.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The exercise consisted of pre-recorded news broadcasts, live “staff” briefings, and moderated discussions on specific topics. These issues were carefully designed in a compelling narrative that educated the participants and the audience.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security</strong>, <strong>World Economic Forum</strong>, and <strong>Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</strong> jointly propose these <a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/recommendations.html">recommendations</a>.</p>

<p>The same organisation "simulated" a scenario in which vaccines are rushed out by governments, causing large numbers of side effects in children:</p>
<p>&rt;As time passed and more people across the United States were <strong>vaccinated</strong>, claims of <strong>adverse side effects</strong> began to emerge. Several parents claimed that their <strong>children were experiencing neurological symptoms</strong> similar to those seen among livestock exposed to the GMI vaccine. By May 2027, parental anxiety around this claim had intensified to the point of lawsuits. That month, a group of parents whose <strong>children developed mental retardation</strong> as a result of encephalitis in the wake of Corovax vaccination sued the federal government, demanding <strong>removal of the liability shield protecting the pharmaceutical companies</strong> responsible for developing and manufacturing Corovax.</p>

<p>Yeah... usually when governments and corporations "prepare" for things, they happen. Remember when the pentagon "simulated" an aircraft would crash into a tower?</p>
<p>&rt;Aside from military exercises, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reconnaissance_Office">National Reconnaissance Office</a> drill was being conducted on September 11, 2001. In a <strong>simulated event</strong>, a small <strong>aircraft would crash into one of the towers of the agency's headquarters</strong> after experiencing a mechanical failure. The NRO is the branch of the <strong>Department of Defense</strong> in charge of spy satellites. According to its spokesman Art Haubold: "No actual plane was to be involved -- to simulate the damage from the crash, some stairwells and exits were to be closed off, forcing employees to find other ways to evacuate the building." He further explained: "<strong>It was just an incredible coincidence that this happened to involve an aircraft crashing into our facility</strong>, as soon as the real world events began, we canceled the exercise." Most of the agency's personnel were sent home after the attacks.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government_operations_and_exercises_on_September_11,_2001#cite_note-12">[12]</a></p>

        <p>Yes I’m well aware of both of these things.  I wouldn’t get kids vaccinated as there’s no reason to in the first place and it hasn’t been tested on kids enough. </p>
<p>That said, we had the same level of distrust with the polio vaccine and smallpox when they existed.</p>

        <p>Same here. My grandmother got put into a medically induced coma because of covid (she declined so fast because she had other health issues that affected her immune system and her age) and died soon after. How she got it? </p>
<p>Her husband needed to be in a physical rehab center to recover from other illnesses + injuries. This rehab center was in a red state, so it's full of pieces of shit who refuse to wear masks or socially distance like these fucks.</p>
<p>He picked it up there, and then gave it to her. He recovered, she didn't and he died three days after her (not from covid, he was completely recovered and we have no idea what caused his death).</p>
<p>They claim to love their country but refuse to do the very things that would help save this godforsaken piece of land.</p>
