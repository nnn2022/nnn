    <strong>Please explain this.</strong>
    <p><p>Ok let me clarify first. I'm not trolling I'm not trying to pick up a fight. I want some clarification if possible. </p>
<p>I'm following the news with this vaccine. I know that MSM is not the best due to news manipulation and lies but is what majority of people watch.</p>
<p>So CNN transmitted <a href="https://youtu.be/EiYG_gcLuf8">this video</a> (skip to 4:25 if you want to hear Dr. Sanjay Gupta) </p>
<p>So he basically said that vaccinated people needs to wear a mask could be carrying the same amount of virus in nose and mouth . So unvaccinated and vaccinated people are the same. </p>
<p>So this means that the vaccine is kind of pointless ? This means that this pandemic of the unvaccinated is BS because vaccinated people can transmit the virus ? </p>
<p>Feel free to leave your opinion, thoughts and everything.</p></p>

        <p>It's so simple and obvious. The vaccines don't work. The masks don't work. They never did, and bringing them back now won't help. The vaccines at best reduce symptoms for people who may have experienced a severe case, and the evidence of that grows shakier by the day.</p>
<p>It was all a lie and an overreaction. It's simple, clear, and obvious. For people who bought into this, it's a hard pill to swallow. The CDC is trying to pass the blame onto us, making it seem like we're holding back progress. If they admit now that they were all wrong, any sliver of goodwill left will be decimated. Their credibility down the toilet. Careers, ruined. Unrest, unleased.</p>

        <p>It just blows my mind that people still trust these agencies. The most poignant example that sticks out in my mind is the fact that these big pharm companies pushed Opioids on the public as ‚Äúnon-addictive‚Äù even though they had to know full fucking well it was synthetic heroin. </p>
<p>The people in this country are more ill and out of shape than ever before. Has modern medicine really made anything better?  Like, I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs worse - their incompetency or their corruption. Either way I don‚Äôt trust them at all. What is it going to take for the public at large to see it????</p>

        <p>Yeah, you pretty much summed it up. Keep in mind you‚Äôre already aware the vaccines are pointless because they‚Äôre going to keep coming up with some new narrative to keep pushing vaccines even when it becomes obvious to the blind that they‚Äôre killing people.</p>

        <p>Depends on what the purpose of the vaccine is. Supposedly it 
A) significantly reduces symptoms of covid illness </p>
<p>and/or </p>
<p>B) reduces viral load and prevents transmission. </p>
<p>We don‚Äôt have enough data to reliably say A is true but it does seem apparent that B isn‚Äôt true either against alpha or delta‚Ä¶.in which case, vaccinated should not be given any more liberties than unvaccinated if the purpose is reducing the spread to protect unvaccinated and exempt people(allergies&amp;religion). The fact that they are given more liberties suggest that none of this is about protection of fellow humans. </p>
<p>If that is true, then that means getting the vaccine is a personal decision and should not restrict anyone‚Äôs liberties and governments shouldn‚Äôt be spending Billions of dollars on expansive vax campaigns. </p>
<p>Of course, we are seeing the opposite happen which presents a huge logical inconsistency of the goal is protecting your fellow man. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve presented this inconsistency to the most intelligent vaccinated individual I know and she said something along the lines of ‚ÄúSometimes the best decision doesn‚Äôt always make sense‚Äù
Due to my respect for her, I entertained that response and found out that she meant if vaccinated people didn‚Äôt get freedoms back, that would cause catastrophic social unrest. </p>
<p>I left the conversation here because I knew we‚Äôd be getting into conspiracy territory if I went further and I only talk empirical data with her. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, she is right. The social unrest would be massive and it would be targeted at one entity: the government. The old saying ‚Äúdivide and conquer‚Äù is a classic because its true. You have to divide the people and point their angst at each other‚Ä¶.otherwise they will overthrow you. What better way to do that than creating two classes of people with different liberties and spew hateful propaganda from their corresponding MSM outlets? None.</p>

        <p>According to their narrative now, vaxxed people are less likely to get a bad case of it but they are spreading it as much (or more, because they're taking zero precautions) as the unvaxxed.</p>

        <p>Nothing to back this up except logic, unsure if that applies here. If you get a traditional vaccine it‚Äôs pretty much like getting that disease. You‚Äôre not feeling the effects of the disease, but a deadened version of the virus goes into your body, and your body, which works 24/7 to protect you, uses its system to create immunity to the virus.</p>
<p>mRNA is bypassing that system. It‚Äôs not even using antibodies to protect you, it‚Äôs just creating spike proteins that fight the virus. </p>
<p>My gut tells me (evolution and logic would, too) that when you gain natural immunity to say, the flu, your body may be able to identify (and fight) variants of the disease. Yes, that immunity isn‚Äôt forever. No, it won‚Äôt protect against all variants. </p>
<p>If you‚Äôre just... telling your body to produce a protein to fight just a specific virus, it wouldn‚Äôt have a function to evolve or fight variants... right? Further, the spike proteins COULDNT keep being made forever... the only way to do that would be to alter your DNA right? It‚Äôs only temporary protection, and once that protection is over with...? You‚Äôve got nothing, no antibodies or anything to fight the disease. Why? Because you bypassed you‚Äôre immune system and are injecting yourself with stuff that creates a spike protons, not immunity.  You‚Äôre basically giving yourself aids, but specifically with Covid? That seems like that‚Äôs where this is going to me.</p>
