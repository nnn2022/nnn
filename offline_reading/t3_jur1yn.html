    <strong>Long Haul COVID and another vent</strong>
    <p><p>I already posted something, but there is something else on my mind. I've been suffering from health problems for years that have made my life miserable. I've been dealing with chronic flu-like symptoms, extreme fatigue, poor memory, confusion, body aches, stomach pain, acid reflux, countless food intolerances, and my hair falling out.  I usually wait until the end of the day to eat because every time I eat my body gets heavy with hangover style headaches and my eyes burn and become bloodshot. I'm constantly suffering. I live my life glued to my bed whenever I'm not at work. </p>
<p>I was recently diagnosed with Hashimotos and a tick-borne illness (not Lyme), but a few years ago when I was at my absolute worst I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), which is basically a useless catch-all diagnosis doctors use when they believe something is wrong but can't figure out what it is. During this time, the fatigue was so profound it felt like a cold wind blowing through my body rattling my bones. I was often too weak to even read, watch TV, or listen to music. Even thinking and feeling emotions was draining. I would lay in bed in a stupor barely clinging to life. I do not know if I was ever on the verge of passing away, but it felt like I was. It felt like my life force was being smothered out of me, and I had to fight to remain conscious. I even had to quit my job and stop working for several months.</p>
<p>During this time it was suspected that elevated levels of a common virus (hhv6) in my blood was a potential culprit. Over 90% of adults are estimated to have hhv6 in their blood with no symptoms. After taking an antiviral, I felt significantly better. Even though I still have health problems till this day, that antiviral was a lifesaver. I'm no longer afraid that doing basic activities such as going to work, running an errand, or taking a shower is going to knock all of the wind out of me and give me such profound fatigue that I'm fearing for my life.</p>
<p>The reason why I'm talking about this is because I'm furious that people are using Long COVID as reason why COVID is such a serious health crisis when CFS and post viral fatigue syndrome can occur after any virus, infection, or trauma to the body. People have been get debilitating chronic fatigue from mono, the flu, and other viruses long before COVID existed, and the media never gave a shit. But now that they can use it to fearmonger about COVID, it's a big deal, and people who've never heard of post viral fatigue before assume it's mostly a COVID thing, and it gives them more of a reason to quake in their boots and rage at others for not taking it seriously enough.</p>
<p>I also believe that the reason why I suffered from CFS and developed unusually high levels of hhv6, Hashimotos, and countless food intolerances is due to the fact that I was born and raised in an over-sanitized, over-medicated western society eating highly processed pesticide-laden food and antibiotic laced meat. It feels like my digestive system and immune system are destroyed, and I'm fighting a losing battle at getting them restored. I feel like my life is ruined. </p>
<p>It freaks me out to see all of the hand sanitizer, bleach, and alcohol based sprays being slathered all over everything while people are afraid to go near each other or touch a single germ all to avoid ONE virus. Meanwhile, their immune systems are getting weaker and infections of all kinds are mutating to become stronger. They don't realize that what they're doing is actually increasing their risk of succumbing to and developing long-term consequences from COVID as well as all other infections. All of these measures to help protect the "immunocompromised" are ironically what's causing so many people to become immunocompromised in the first place. </p>
<p>It's not COVID that's the major health issue, it's poor lifestyle/environmental factors (poor diet, medications, oversanitization, pollution, and lack of exercise) that are making us more susceptible to dying from COVID and all other diseases that should be treated as the real health crisis. But all anyone talks about is COVID COVID COVID and how COVID is the hugest threat to the health of all mankind while the real threats continue to fester and be ignored. </p>
<p>I only wash my hands when going to the bathroom or preparing food for others. I never wash my hands otherwise, not even when preparing food for myself after touching many surfaces in public. I never use bleach. If food falls on the floor, I pick it back up and eat it. I want people to come close to me and talk to me without masks. Some of this sounds gross, but I want my immune system to get stronger and become more focused on attacking outside forces rather than me. And if I contract and die from COVID, I will blame my death on having a weakened immune system due to a history of poor lifestyle factors, not the COVID itself.</p></p>

        <p>We used to live in a world where as someone with potential to wield power over others, you had to prove to others that your hypotheses were correct (or at least show a high balance of probability) before you got to influence public policy. We now live in a bizzaro-world where you and I have to <em>disprove</em> what our politicians and healthcare dictators are telling us - and they push through their edicts regardless.</p>
<p>"Long Covid" is a prime example of this.</p>
<p>These guys are talking about "long term effects" for a virus that has only been in the spotlight for less than a year. And governments, media, and sheeple are eating it up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you dare to ask about the possible "long term effects" of a rushed, suspect Covid vaccine, you are effectively told "Shut up and take the jab, slave!"</p>
<p>Funny, that.</p>

        <p>I'm with you I do the same thing in regards to washing. I was visiting my husband's family who happened to have colds and they tried to keep us away and I said umm were not crazy we will come over and hang with you. They were relieved and my body got the immunities it needed. I even felt myself fighting something that disappeared on its own. They do have an idea what they're doing. A weakened immune system and weakened mental health the elite can unleash anything. They have full control and no one is fighting it so in the end they win. I just refuse to go down without a fight. I won't wear the mask. I don't social distance. If you wanna walk away because I'm too close cool that's on you. Otherwise leave my immune system alone and let it do it's job!</p>

        <p>Long covid is speculation, and that viral fatigue syndrome you mentioned probably explains it. You feel like that after a bad flu, so why is this special for covid? Plus some stuff could be from health effects of lockdown or weakened immune system from the measures. I'm somewhat allergic to hand sanitizer so I refuse it, but the spray chemicals hurt my eyes and skin a lot and it sucks.</p>

        <p>The only difference is they are scrutinizing EVERY little symptom, and counting every little thing.</p>
<p>Do that for Influenza and you could create 90% of the news hype.</p>

        <p>You mention food intolerances, look into the elimination diet.  Many of our health problems stem from our diet.  While most people can handle all sorts of food, some have bad reactions to seemingly harmless foods such as vegetables.</p>
