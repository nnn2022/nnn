    <strong>This is all just been so depressing to watch unfold</strong>
    <p><p>I’m posting this because my brain is all over the place and I want to get my thoughts straight.</p>
<p>In the past I used to love researching conspiracy theories and would routinely consume myself in them. Sometimes I would notice my mental health start to decline due to all the doom and gloom, so I’d give the internet a break and focus on my personal health and happiness, and that would bring me right out of the funk. I find it is extremely difficult to do that in this situation because COVID has impacted nearly every aspect of my personal life. </p>
<p>I will likely have to change career avenues (I am studying in the health fields) if I refuse the vaccine, and I have racked up so much student debt for a career that is likely to be put behind a paywall of injecting myself with experimental drugs. I don’t have nearly the amount of money to support myself sufficiently and my prospects of achieving that status in the near future is looking very grim. I find myself lacking motivation to do much of anything these days, because for all I know 5 years from now the world will look and operate in frighteningly different ways, and people like me will be punished.</p>
<p>It’s just so wrong that we’re being subject to this. Our children do not deserve to be brought up in these conditions and people do not deserve the devastating blows to their livelihoods and personal relationships that this bullshit has dealt worldwide. We are at a turning-point in humanity; we are on the doorstep of adopting living conditions that eliminate autonomy and privacy of citizens, and nobody around me seems to care.</p>
<p>Maybe I’m being pessimistic, but I truly hesitate to apply the phrases “this too shall pass” or “things always work out in the end” to this situation, because we are dealing with a ruthless conspiracy that is bigger than we all imagine, and the forces driving it have the media, governments of the world, and a frighteningly-large portion of the populace in their back pockets. The efforts to silence opposition is astounding, and it will only escalate as time goes on.</p>
<p>The worst part of it is, it is all causing us to lose our humanity. We shun, label, and wish harm on people who refuse the vaccine, refuse to wear a mask walking down the street, people who want to share their adverse effects from the vaccine, people who criticize crooks like Fauci and the FDA; all because these people are terrified of their long-standing worldview being based on a big fat lie.</p>
<p>These people don’t want to rock the boat, they don’t want to acknowledge that the world we live in is built on corruption and deceit, because cognitive dissonance will not allow that. The lies are interwoven into our perception of what it means to live in this world, and the mind cannot cope with the possibility that we’re all being intentionally misled on a global scale, because it will completely upend our cozy picture we’ve painted of how the world operates.</p>
<p>At 25 I find myself looking into the remainder of my life with complete and utter uncertainty. Will I be able to start a family and have a child of my own? Will I be able to travel the world? Will I be able to work my dream job? Will we all be dead in 10 years? Will the country I was raised in exist as I know it for much longer?</p>
<p>The last year and a half took my zest for life and destroyed it. I hate what this has done to my mind, I hate what this has done to my loved ones, I hate what this has done to fellow human beings who don’t deserve any of this shit. I’ve struggled on and off with depression throughout my life, but this shit has totally redefined depression for me. And it’s not because this virus is mowing down my loved ones or because I’m stepping over corpses on my walk to work, it’s because we have been gaslit, censored, and discriminated against for wanting transparency, for wanting consistency from our leadership, and for wanting the whole truth. Our ability to live life on our own terms is now dependent on our compliance to the government-sponsored bastardization of health and autonomy. Comply or become a second-class citizen, the choice is ours.</p>
<p>I’m going to do my best to put the internet machine down for a bit and bask in the simple beauties of life and spend time with people who I love. I’m gonna go sober for a bit and try to piece back together my mental and physical health which is been on the decline for the last few months. I am tired, and I need to prioritize the things that I can control and stop putting those things on the back burner.</p>
<p>Anyone who read this thank you, and for anyone out there struggling with hopelessness and frustration, I hope this post shows you that you are not alone.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, I never could imagine the world turned into this. It is basically a nightmare, one where you're glad when you finally wake up. If only people would wake up. The biggest nightmare are the people who are stuck in their rigid belief and compliance, willing to do harm to those who have awoken.</p>

        <p>To everyone reading this, you must understand that Christians knew this was coming since we first read the bible or heard sermons from true pastors like David Wilkerson. </p>
<p>The same people that tell you God doesn't exist are the same evil that's committing the covid lie. There are only two ways out of this, being taken unto evil when it's all said and done, or being saved, repenting of sin, giving our lives to God, and being taken unto real life in heaven. </p>
<p>If you haven't yet read the bible, now is the time to start while you still have time!</p>

        <p>Well, we kind of do since it explains exactly what to look out for + the fact that Israel was reinstated as a nation and the Bible said that the generation that was reinstated would not pass before the end times.</p>

        <p>Because we are experiencing a very sophisticated mind control operation. If you lack the knowledge of self, you will be lassoed into their box. Consequently, If you do have the knowledge of self, going through this BS becomes very frustrating because you see where they’re trying to take us. Hold the fort down. Love is everything and knowledge is power. Love yourself and love your neighbor. Screw those who lust after power and control.</p>

        <p>That’s the problem to begin with. When did we start to outsource the education of our children? Parents have been to accustomed to treating these institutions like day care instead of seeing them for what they are. Indoctrination centers that mold our children’s perception.</p>

        <p>You're not alone. I've given up on convincing anyone who believes the narrative otherwise. I am fully accepting the consequences of my decision to respect my bodily autonomy regardless of what thankfully only 1/2 of my family has decided to do. I do not hang out with many of my old friends any more, but I've gained some already close ones in solidarity through this. I also don't hold it against anyone who decides to get the jab, but I will tell people straight up that I cannot get it, and, that it's private if they're to ask why. There are states in the US like FL and TX that are promoting more rights for those wish to maintain their bodily autonomy. And there are states that are riddled in corruption, fear, and manipulation who'll shame anyone who stands out from the masses. I'm prepared to leave, I'm prepared to change careers, I'm prepared to accept the outcome. There is obviously something nefarious going on whether or not this jab is safe long term. Being gaslit makes anyone question their sanity and I'm lucky to have a well rounded understanding of that before the media was claimed to do this. We're not alone, don't let anyone make you think you're wrong or alone for wanting to respect your human right to bodily autonomy.</p>

        <p>It’s all about personal choice. I don’t care who gets the jab. I DO CARE when I’m being coerced into taking one with threats of the loss of employment, the ability to go to sports games or music events, or being discriminated against at all because I personally choose not to get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>When you said this last year and a half took your zest for life and destroyed it, I really felt that. It did for me too. I just told someone recently that I feel that my joy has been stolen from me. I am not truly enjoying my life…..I’m just surviving my life right now. I’m so sorry you’re having such a difficult time. Thank you so much for writing out and sharing your thoughts with us. You are not alone. There are many of us in the same boat with you. I don’t know you, but I wish you all the best. I hope you are able to find your zest for life again. I hope we all can.</p>

        <p>I'm also 25 and am having the same thoughts as you. I'm so scared of what the world will look like in 10 years time if we are still here. I deleted my social media (aside from Reddit) over a year ago now and I will never go back, but it does make me feel like I don't fit into society anymore, especially people my age. I have realised over the past year that I have different values and priorities than most people around me, that they truly care more about just being alive and going along with the status quo then actually living their lives. That is not how I want to live my life.</p>

        <p>Conspiracy theories used to always be an interesting fascination that eventually reached a dead end with government secrecy. At the end of the day you could always point fingers at the government &amp; feel smarter for doing so. That’s what made it so fun.</p>
<p>Now they are considered obvious “right leaning” common sense observations that eventually come true in 6-10 months all while the government accuses YOU of being mentally unstable &amp; demanding you don’t trust your lying eyes. That is not fun.</p>

        <p>I relate so much with this. The de-motivation, uncertainty and frustration since May last year has also just been getting worse.</p>
<p>I think the worst part of it is we're never going back to "normal" that much is clear - but what the world is going to look like in 5-10yrs is impossible to say. It'll be the "new normal" I suppose.</p>
<p>If this whole thing is a depop agenda, let's get it over with already. I can't take another year of the "it's for your safety" bullshit.</p>

        <p>Sure, Brave Men by Ernie Pyle; any book by David McCullough, also there’s an older compilation called “Brave Americans and Their Noble Deeds” I think it’s still in print. Also- check out Jordan Peterson’s “12 Rules For Life” also Mark Levin has a book coming out in July called “American Marxism” that recommends a path forward through the storm. Start listening to the Daily Wire group of podcasts, they are stable and uplifting, even if you don’t agree, (Ben Shapiro, Matt Walsh, Andrew Klavan, Michael Knowles) fill your brain and your ears with the people who are actively resisting. hey, and if you’re in a blue state/city freaking move!!!!! I live in a Midwestern red state that has more than corn, and PLENTY of people, even doctors, here are refusing the vaccine. Like I said, chin up, man, all is not yet lost.</p>

        <p>I'm a bit older than you, and it's bad enough. But I  think it's insane what they're doing to younger people. At the very beginning, I was pro-lockdown because I thought the virus was going to be like they showed us: people falling down in the streets and the hospitals overflowing. When they said "if it saves one life, surely we can stay in for a few weeks", I was like, sure, I can do that.</p>
<p>But more than a year later and all I see is lives being destroyed, by lockdowns, by the new social tyranny, by vaccine injuries, and none of it has even stopped the people who were vulnerable to covid from being vulnerable to covid.</p>
<p>I just want to apologise to your generation on behalf of people who've lived a bit longer and should know better. At least we all should have read a few history books and know where this type of thing can go.</p>

        <p>Pretty much. This is their final act.. if they get away with this.. No more freedom of speech, movement or bodily autonomy and my worst fear is there's not enough of us to do anything about it. I just hope nature intervenes or something because I have no hope in humanity. I wish I could muster up hope but technology has made people lazy, stupid and tribal. I just wanted to have a family and a little farm and im still planning on it but it feels futile. Im just waiting for the other shoe to drop now.</p>

        <p>I'm curious about these people like OP, and why I don't see much talk about just lying about getting the vaccine.....I personally have not got one, but they don't make you carry some special card or something, which says "vaccinated", right?</p>
<p>If it were me, and my livelihood which I had many hours of hard work, school, debts, etc put into that particular field, I would 💯 lie about it. Maybe even go as far as making fake paperwork if that was necessary.....just saying, there isn't much to lose in that situation. </p>
<p>If you're familiar with poker, I would essentially feel "pot committed", when you already have so much invested in the "pot", that you're pretty much obligated to stay in no matter the cost.</p>

        <p>in the medical field, certain state boards (and health care companies) require immunizations in order to practice. you have to produce a signed copy of the immunization record at time of hire and yearly thereafter. the state boards audit the companies every 4-7 years (depending on the specific state you're dealing with) to ensure everyone is following the regulations.</p>
<p>forging those documents (and get caught) would result in termination and (potentially) the state boards pulling your license.</p>
<p>if i were 150k in debt, i couldn't afford risking my license.</p>

        <p>God built Adam and Eve a Garden for their eternal pleasure.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it's real. The facade of this plastic society and it's vacuous relationships is being crushed. What's real in your life? And I mean, really real.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what isn't real in my very humble and aged opinion. College. Career. Corporatism. Institutionalism. Consumerism. Politics. "Friendships". MONEY!</p>
<p>All fake and all conceived, designed and organized by your eternal enemy. The only real thing, in this realm, is your relationship with your Creator and the sublimely frightening escape of naked faith in His Will for your life.</p>
<p>All other approaches, philosophies, conspiracies and ideas have failed me.</p>
<p>Naked abandonment before your Supernatural God is the ONLY thing that makes sense considering you have no idea where you came from, how you got here and, like the rest of us, you are blind to the future, even a millisecond.</p>
<p>What choice do you have but find what's real and surrender to that? The results are spectacular, I swear.</p>
