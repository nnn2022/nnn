    <strong>There's just no talking to these people</strong>
    <p><p>I usually don't debate strangers on the Internet over anything serious. Sports and TV/movies are about as far as I go. </p>
<p>But I've briefly gotten into some debates over COVID with people on Twitter and it's just impossible to reason with them. The double standards and pick and choose attitude over what to be outraged about is mind numbing. </p>
<p>For example: they urge everyone to get the vaccine like it's the greatest thing in the history of the world. But then when you say, alright so if I get the vaccine then that's that. No more mask, no more social distancing, etc. Nope! Then they do a total 180 and trash the vaccine saying "it's not 100%! We don't know enough about it yet!" "SELFISH!!!" </p>
<p>Sooo get the vaccine but nothing changes and we don't know enough about it. But still get it. It just makes no sense to me. Every other vaccine that you get there is no debate over whether you can live your life normally after you get it. Measles is far more infectious than COVID. The vaccine is 93% effective and yet no one walks around with a mask and worries about 6 feet over that. The polio vaccine isn't 100% effective either. Before the polio vaccine it was a high risk to take your kid to a community pool cause that's where it spread the most. Now people take their vaccinated kids to pools, waterparks, etc with no worries at all. Not even if every kid in there is vaccinated against polio. </p>
<p>Why is COVID, a far less infectious and dangerous disease than the two I mentioned so different? Bottom line: You can't reason with unreasonable people.</p></p>

        <p>I gave up talking to people who arent at least curious or open minded a long time ago. </p>
<p>A lot of people are just delusional and cant ever be convinced, no matter what evidence or facts come out, theyll always believe the same things. </p>

        <p>I’ve spent a lot of time contemplating this exact issue following some rather heated arguments and fallings-our with family and friends. I even got called a fascist for my views on covid by someone, which, considering in direction which politics (notably US politics) are taking, doesn’t surprise me at all. </p>
<p>But, to answer your question; mainstream media and every “big personality” has been beating the COVID drum for over a year now. When people hear the same thing over, and over, and over again, they believe it and in essence, begin to follow it. This has been seen on multiple occasions in history. Whether you present cold hard statistics or just opinions, they will never listen. In Lehman’s terms; they’re brainwashed.</p>
<p>I’m very keen to see how, if ever, this situation will conclude. But one thing is for sure, it’s absolutely not surprising whatsoever that governments worldwide may be keeping things (notably extraterrestrial activity) secret from us, if such a relatively normal thing like a virus causes this extent of hysteria.</p>

        <p>This right here. People have been hearing for a year about how their own death is imminent. Clearly irrational given the facts, but when you threaten a person's survival rationality goes out the window.</p>
<p>Even if they don't believe it, the duration and continually moving the goal posts is part of that mental breaking down.</p>
<p>"Oh, only two weeks. Cool"</p>
<p>"They thought two weeks and now it is three months, they can't get control of it!"</p>
<p>All while the media has a death odometer in your face all the time. It's easy to be mad at them, and many simply will never open their mind, but it is also easy to sympathize. You're asking a person to be able to stand up to the propaganda machine that has been perfected over the course of over a century, not easy as y'all reading this know.</p>

        <p>I used to get really angry, now I pity them. They clearly lack the mental capacity to make informed decisions and need big pharma/ government and their fave celebrity idols to tell them what to think. </p>
<p>The irony is that those people (celebs / gov etc)are not taking the vaccine. Yeah, they'll say they have. Or even put on a little show in front of the camera (injecting Saline).They don't trust it and are happy to make the general public a big science experiment. </p>
<p>I was actually wondering if there was any point in debating any of them. I mean - it's not like you can get through and appeal to their more suspicious nature. They are unable the think logically, I'm afraid. </p>
<p>All you can do is ignore their stupid comments about being "selfish". We know they are hypocrites. Wanting life to come to a screeching halt, ignoring increasing suicide rates, bankruptcy, unemployment all because they are so terrified of a disease they will almost certainly beat naturally. Wanting us to inject some experimental chemical cocktail so they feel "safer" even though it changes nothing except increasing our risk of adverse side effects. </p>
<p>Silly silly children, the lot of them!</p>

        <p>For me, all trust has been permanently lost on this vaccine and the people pushing it. There is nothing anyone can say or do at this point to make me regain their trust. They simply are not worthy of my time or attention.</p>

        <p>I've been going back and forth with an idiot on another lockdown-critical sub today, and he actually said "I know I'm vaccinated, but I keep wearing my mask because I don't want other people to think we can relax."</p>
<p>It's like... how do you reason with someone who openly admits he's okay with psycho-social coercion if he thinks it fits the greater good?</p>

        <p>You are right. 9 time out of 10 you won't be able to reason with someone that has their mind made up. You won't even be able to find a middle ground if you try. The way I see it, just speak the truth, bring the data that you have to the table and let them take it for what they will. Sadly facts dont have a place at the table for a lot of people today. When it comes down to it these people dont have a back bone. For example I commented on a post last night. Some doomer tried to say that because i want free will and personal responsibility for onesself for everyone over all, this was somehow anarchy and not how a civilized society works. It was also somehow selfish and unpatriotic. Etc etc. We debate back and forth. Every comment this guy uses deflection, and eventually starts the name calling. That's what these people do when you don't back down and submit to giving up freedom as an acceptable route. Needless to say this morning all of his comments were deleted. Stand strong. Hold your ground.  Be stern but polite, and keep educating yourself. They show their true character when they dont get their way. It usually immature and entitled.</p>

        <p>Lol what the fuck we eradicated polio. That’s why you don’t need the vaccine anymore. If measles were more infectious than covid, we would have 150 million measles cases.  There’s nothing to prevent my spit from containing covid, even if I’m vaccinated. The same goes for every single infection with a vaccine. If I’m vaccinated and you’re not I can still give it to you.</p>
