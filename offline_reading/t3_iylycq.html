    <strong>there is no Santa Claus, Virginia</strong>
    <p><p>we have lost our damn minds and this has sent me into a complete doom spiral because i can't and won't wear a face diaper forever:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.doli.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Proposed-Permanent-Standard-for-Infectious-Disease-Prevention-for-COVID-19-7.24.2020.pdf">16VAC25-220: Permanent Standard for Infectious Disease Prevention - COVID-19</a></p>
<p>what - and i repeat ,what - the fuck are we doing, Virginia? ARE YOU HIGH RIGHT NOW? DO YOU NEED AN ADULT?</p>
<p>the Commonwealth of Virginia wants to make all of these Temporary Emergency Standards permanent. and it gets better - the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry’s Safety and Health Code Board allowed no public hearing before adoption, only <a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/comments.cfm?GeneralNoticeid=1137">written comments</a>. they are sneaking this is with a "virtual General Assembly" like thieves in the night. fucking THIEVES AND GHOULS. </p>
<p>(shaking with anger, smh. literally shaking.)</p>
<p>Governor Blackface (or Klanrobes, whatever, he's such a fucking racist piece of white trash garbage, except garbage has redeeming value) is going to kill small business in Virginia. he is going to tank the economy. he is going to condemn a generation of children and teenagers to a lifetime of reduced wages and lost potential. this will snuff out any and all innovation in the tech industry. employers - to include big defense and government contractors - will leave as Virginia becomes a high tax, low return cesspool. these regulations will be enforced the hardest against Virginians with black and brown skin, the immigrant community, and our low income residents.</p>
<p>i'm not doing it - i will not wear a mask in public forever. i will not do it at work, i will not tolerate this at a restaurant, i will not go shopping, and i will drive my fat Italian ass to and from work every day in my own personal vehicle. we will not send our future children to school, at all. you wanna see Pippi become some sort of weird hermit shaman? WATCH PIPPI BECOME SOME SORT OF WEIRD SHAMAN HERMIT.</p>
<p>my husband and i will have to move. i can't live like this. i am miserable. I AM AN EXTROVERT ON HOUSE ARREST AND I DIDN'T EVEN COMMIT ANY FUN CRIMES. i know that i have been very optimistic and happy and i try put on a strong showing and big smile, but i'm breaking down. i'm Tinkerbell - i need attention to live, and Governor Blackface is blacking out my sparkle and sunshine.</p>
<p>more info and some good analysis here: <a href="https://www.baconsrebellion.com/wp/permanent-covid-reg-called-the-fifth-dragon/">Bacon's Rebellion: Permanent COVID Regulations Called the "Fifth Dragon"</a></p>
<p>what can we do? vote the bastards out? a class action lawsuit? can we take this to the Supreme Court?</p>
<p>i will literally vote for anyone running this year and going forward who opposes these "new normal" measures, or we'll leave. fuck this. i'm a smart little broad - i'll leave. my husband is a lawyer and he can pass the bar anywhere, and we'll be fine. i am not property of the state, i am not the property of my husband or my father or my brother, i am still a free woman and i will remain so until my last breath, so help me god(s).</p>
<p>JFC Virginia, it's sic semper tyrannis ("thus always to tyrants"), not "bend over and spread" (idk how to say that in Latin, apologies).</p></p>

        <p>Oh wow. Well if you do decide to move, come on down south to Atlanta, Georgia. We have a Republican Governor and there’s no mask mandate. We are pretty much back to normal, masks are still a thing but no one screams like a Pod Person if you don’t wear one.</p>

        <p>Come on over to West Virginia! It's the better Virginia. Low cost of living, amazing food, and quaint little towns with low violent crime rates. I lived there for several years before moving to PA for "better oppirtunities" and now I regret it. Some areas of the state, like Charleston and Morgantown, have more restrictions than others, but the rural areas and small towns aren't that bad. Kids in several counties have returned to school and are playing sports. There is a mask mandate, but it's not being enforced. Those who work in DC can easily commute from the eastern Panhandle and people who work in PA can commute from the Northern part of the state. West Virginians are pretty set in their ways so I don't think the "new normal" will stick around there.</p>

        <p>Oh my God. I know Central Florida is more than eager to try something like this. A judge in Orange County blocked a challenge to the face mask mandate and it has no expiration date.</p>
