    <strong>Masks - The Running Joke of 2020</strong>
    <p><p>All the controversy, controversy  and "new" science surrounding the  effectiveness of the mask finally triggered a memory from the past. I worked in the asbestos removal industry when I was young and this got me thinking becasue of the PPE we were required to wear, which was a fully sealed half face that was fit tested, with disposable Hepa cartridge similar to the one you see in the picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://pksafety.com/blog/what-is-the-best-asbestos-rated-respirator">https://pksafety.com/blog/what-is-the-best-asbestos-rated-respirator</a></p>
<p>This memory motivated me to conduct some research into various aspects of masks.</p>
<p>The first is the size of the particle and here's a comparison chart for a variety of particles:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/particle-sizes-d_934.html">https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/particle-sizes-d_934.html</a></p>
<p>Comparing the size of the particle's I noticed that Virus's particle size relative to asbestos are between 140 and 300 times smaller. (measurements in micron's)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/particle-sizes-d_934.html">https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/particle-sizes-d_934.html</a></p>
<p>Based on this, I wanted to see if they had an actual size reference for COVID, and they do! between 60-140nm which is equivalent to .06 - .14 micron's or micrometers)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/The-Size-of-SARS-CoV-2-Compared-to-Other-Things.aspx">https://www.news-medical.net/health/The-Size-of-SARS-CoV-2-Compared-to-Other-Things.aspx</a></p>
<p>I was a little baffled by the requirements we followed for asbestos and yet for a virus that is a fraction of the size a simple cloth mask will do? I mean the largest measure of COVID is between 5 and 642 times smaller than the smallest asbestos particle. I Did some further research into comparing mask in general and came across an article describing the N95 mask itself and the testing requirements. </p>
<p>It appears that the testing requirements to prove effectiveness against various bacteria and virus's is highly dependent on size of the particle and that these particles are contained in a liquid which we expel. Oh just for the record bacteria is between 5 to 10 microns long, which is actually a pretty sizable particle in comparison. However, the science behind the n95 and equivalent is based on the layering of specific fabrics which will eventually capture virus's, but one thing to note is the testing requirements, which they have a choice of to methods (strange) to achieve approval for market. One of the choices involved the ability for the mask to capture an aerosol of .1 micrometer, which barely achieves the maximum size of COVID and in fact is almost twice the size of the smallest COVID virus. Very interesting. </p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2009/10/14/n95/">https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2009/10/14/n95/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I did some further research into transmission and came across this article (got to love pre 2020 science, seems so contradictory to what they are selling us now). This article covers the transmission of virus's through the ocular path, which if you read,, it demonstrates that transmission through the eye is well known path for the Sar' s associated coronavirus. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3591987/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3591987/</a></p>
<p>In conclusion, it certainly appears that even the N95 mask may not be sufficient to stop the spread of COVID, and that this mask hype is exactly that, hype! They know cloth masks will make virtually no positive impact on the spread, its like using a tuna net to capture minnows. It's purely a 100% psychological tactic with no medical benefit whatsoever. Subsequently these masks will do nothing physically for us, other than being a potential cesspool to capture larger bacteria's which people will be rebreathing all day long.   </p>
<p>If there was a real pandemic endangering the human race, this is what we should be walking around in becasue nothing else is going to have much of an impact on the spread of a virus.</p>

<p>And just give it time, they continue to find ways to beat down our immune systems, so it might not be long before that common cold becomes lethal.</p>

        <p>all they have to do make the common cold lethal is what they have been doing already. </p>
<p>simply count any death to be from covid, rather than the 2.6 chronic underlying conditions and old age that actually caused the death.</p>
<p>here is the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">rule change</a> that applies only to the 'covid' to <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qjLOD4v.jpg">count any death as a covid death</a></p>
<p>never forget that a covid 'case' pays more (elective stuff was shut down, so they need the money) and are exempt from any and all liability (malpractice claims)</p>

        <p>You are 100% correct! The truth is so obvious that is literally smacking people in the face and hey utterly refuse to acknowledge it. Goes to prove that their decades of social and behavioral experiments are yielding a very high success rate.</p>

        <p>I'm not 100% certain, however I think that is something they are currently experimenting with attempting to create a "Non stick" or Tefal..lol.. mask, that virus's can't adhere too. </p>
<p>https://www.fastcompany.com/90505641/this-coating-makes-viruses-slide-right-off-fabric</p>
<p>Maybe they are gonna sell it as a multi purpose tool. "Wear it or fry your eggs on it, or both your choice!" 
They will come up with the science to sell you anything if they can make a buck.</p>
<p>Here's the alleged current composition of the N95 mask.</p>
<p>https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf12/K122702.pdf</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit, I came across an article (can't post link becasue i can't find it again), but it discussed how the N95 stops viral penetration through the layers. How virus's great than a certain size are captured by the material, and how smaller ones get trapped in essentially water vapor. But reading it my first thought was how the methodology to capture the smaller particles or virus's relies on the suffocation of the mask where the openings become congested with water vapor so virus's can't pass through...If this is the case then air will also have a difficult time transferring through, subsequently the user has to expend more energy just to breathe and there's a pretty good chance that in this effort these water vapors containing the virus will be breathed in deeply by the wearer, and this doesn't even encompass the risks associated with oxygen deprivation which could be a result also. I guess that's one way to stop the penetration of a virus though, if one can't breathe one can't inhale the virus.</p>
