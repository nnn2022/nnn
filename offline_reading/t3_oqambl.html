    <strong>Historians of The Subreddit, what is your take on the of governments Covid-19 Response e.g. lockdowns &amp; vaccine passports?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm asking Specifically about developed nations that have taken up these measures e.g. France, Australia, UK.</p>
<p>Many people are comparing the actions of governments to the Nazis especially when it comes to vaccine discrimination. It's my belief that this is the largest government atrocity (in the developed nations) since the 1940s, would you agree/disagree?</p>
<p>Is this the thin end of the wedge, how does it end?</p>

        <p>To put it in short, it is a Government expansion masquerading as a medical response. </p>
<p>If you look at the events of the Spanish Flu, they too had lockdowns and mandatory masking. However, these lasted for 2 weeks at a time and were legitimatly geared towards not overwhelming the hospital system, which was already overflowing. Once the 2 weeks were over, everything resumed to normal as it had before. I think there were 2 or 3 of these 2 week lockdowns over about a year period. </p>
<p>This is likely the model that would have been followed if the covid response was legitimate. </p>
<p>Thanks to places like Nazi Germany, North Korea, and Soviet Russia, much of the world is aware of what totalitarian regiemes look like and how they operate. Namely, state restrictions of speech, movement, and commerce. If tomorrow Joe Biden and Fauci dressed in military uniform and had soldiers with jackboots threaten people at gunpoint to shut up and take the vaxx nobody would be for it except for a small group of sycophants. </p>
<p>But if you instead use doctors/scientists and coerce mass media companies and corporations to do your bidding, all of a sudden, nobody recognizes a tyranny. Plus, they are scared of an invisible enemy and people are easy to manipulate if they are frightened and more likely to follow the herd as they regress to a more primitive state of survival. </p>
<p>However, the primary ingredients are essentially the same. State restriction of speech, movement, and commerce. All the government did this time is run it through proxies instead of using soldiers with guns.</p>
