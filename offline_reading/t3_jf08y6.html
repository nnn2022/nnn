        <p>I get the impression he is more annoyed that people are using the exemption rule as an excuse to not wear one, when they are not medically exempt. </p>
<p>Hes right in a way. I'm against the mask rules being forced on to us, and if you go somewhere without being challenged for not wearing one, then great. But it is shitting on those who truly are medically exempt, when people are just saying that they are to get around not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Wrong - it is supportive of the people who are actually exempt.  Why?  Because they will get shit for it anyway, the more people who aren't wearing one, the better for everyone including the medically exempt people.  It allows some solidarity and it is much easier to not be the only one not wearing a mask somewhere - take that from someone who has never worn one.</p>
