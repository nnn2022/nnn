    <p><p>Obv itâ€™s all up in the air at the moment and no one will ever really know the true number..  </p>
<p>I guess I just want an easy/direct way to argue with people who shout these huge death numbers, as it involves a fairly complicated/ nuanced discussion about PCR tests and the whole deaths from or with covid thing. </p>
<p>Even saying 99.9 recovery rate just flies over their head or makes them angrier. 
Something simple a child could understand and not too aggressive as ultimately want to get through and wake them up. 
Am I making sense? 
Clever people??</p></p>
