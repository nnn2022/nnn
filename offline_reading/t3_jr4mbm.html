    <strong>Not worth it</strong>
    <p><p>Hey there, I've been in your shoes before and wrestled with depression and suicide at the same age too. It's not worth thinking all is lost. This too shall pass. You are not alone in your line of thinking. I am neither Republican nor Democrat, and I get treated the same way as you.</p>
<p>The key to positive mental health is to accept your line of thinking will not line up with your friends, and that's ok! Now I would question if these people are your real friends, because real friends don't attack and shame your line of thinking. Real friends can disagree with you, but they will respect your stance and not treat you like a monster or call you names.</p>
<p>Now, Biden cannot do squat. He can use an executive order to mandate masks nationally, but these can be overruled at the State levels. It largely depends on your representatives' political alignment. I hate the masks and lockdowns as much as everyone else on this sub, but don't kill yourself over it. Don't hide your depression from your parents, this is serious and the first step to healing is recognizing you're depressed and step 2 is asking for help.</p>
<p>Find some positive hobbies like playing an instrument or playing video games. Find your "happy place". For me, it's working out at the gym and playing video games.</p>
<p>You can resist the order and still be happy. The key to winning mental warfare is not letting the other side's beratement get to you. Take a stance and stick to it; make the other side begin to question themselves and their beliefs. When they try to explain it to you they will begin to find out their errors in thinking.</p>
<p>The ignorant are going to be ignorant. Think about it. These people have created a mental safety net and are as equally depressed. It's a coping mechanism of rationalizing the actions of their leaders they trusted so dearly. They're going to protect it at all costs regardless of the destruction they cause. They have to figure it out on their own. Eventually everyone will see through the bullshit and push back.</p>
<p>TL; DR: stay strong; talk to your parents and don't suppress your emotions. You need to accept them and process them and find a happy way out.</p></p>
