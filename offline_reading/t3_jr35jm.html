    <strong>The Patriot Act &amp; The New Normal</strong>
    <p><p>We, in the United States of America, have not been living under the surveillance powers of the draconian Patriot Act since June 2020. </p>
<p>I know what 99% of you are thinking. Bullshit, right? </p>
<p>"On March 10, 2020, Jerry Nadler proposed a bill to reauthorize the Patriot Act, and it was then approved the majority of US House of Representatives after 152 Democrats joined the GOP in supporting the extension. The surveillance powers of the Patriot Act needed renewal by March 15, 2020, and after it expired, the U.S. Senate approved an amended version of the bill. After President Donald Trump threatened to veto the bill, the House of Representatives issued an indefinite postponement of the vote to pass the Senate version of the bill; as of June 2020, the Patriot Act remains expired."</p>
<p>Well that must be nonsense because you never heard about that. Trump threatened to veto the Patriot Act and so the House never voted to reauthorize it and the powers expired in June? Crazy talk. But that paragraph came from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#Reauthorizations">the Patriot Act's wikipedia page...</a></p>
<p>So here's what I am getting at.</p>
<p>How insanely fortunate is it that after finding out that they will be losing the sweeping surveillance powers of the Patriot Act due to an outsider president threatening to veto it if passed some time between March 10 and 15, that statewide lockdowns just happen to occur starting on March 15th? During these lockdowns, the entire populace is told to stay inside and limit movement while special tracking apps are deployed to everyone's smartphones.</p>
<p>How insanely fucking fortunate, indeed. </p>
<p>SO yeah, if these two dots aren't connected, I'm at a loss. Guess it's just my crazy conspiracist mindset again getting the better of me.</p></p>

        <p>It must be stated and good job connecting the dots.</p>
<p>You might get some validation in January or shortly thereafter depending on the GA senate races.</p>
