    <p><p>To be honest I'm having trouble digging some up, but I'm certain it has happened. If I'm not mistaken it's the basis of the opioid crisis.</p></p>

        <p>Ahh fuck. Ya got me started lmao. You're 100% right about the opioid crisis. It began with oxycontin, which was promoted (if you can imagine) as NON ADDICTIVE!!! If you think for a moment that they didn't know they were aware that oxy is basically just pure heroin (yeah I know it's a different chemical make-up, but the effects are the same) and that they were taking advantage of desperate pain patients and addicts, ya gotta lotta thinking to do yet. I'll never trust big pharma, for that and countless other instances of life altering lies they've told.</p>

        <p>‚ÄúBookchin and Schumacher complain that since the era of Bernice Eddy the NIH hierarchy has been consistently dismissive of evidence that SV40 from vaccines may have caused human cancers. Officials who had previously said SV40 was harmless were authorised to assess independent research that challenged that conclusion: ‚ÄúNot surprisingly, they reaffirmed their own previous wisdom.‚Äù Accepting that SV40 is a human carcinogen, they continue, raises questions about what the government response should be: ‚ÄúA coordinated and extensive search for SV40 in other kinds of tumors, coupled with far greater efforts to study how the virus causes tumors? A crash SV40 screening program among populations most likely to have been infected? ‚Ä¶ An anti-SV40 vaccination campaign?‚Äù The problem, they continue, is that to undertake any of these options the government would have to admit that it should have acted sooner to protect public health.</p>
<p>In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (University of Chicago Press, 1962) Thomas Kuhn suggests that paradigm shifts don't happen because opponents are converted by evidence, but rather because one generation of investigators and scientific leaders dies and is replaced by another. For credible epidemiological studies confirming whether SV40 from polio vaccines has caused human cancers, we may have to wait until a new generation is put in charge of the USA's health research bureaucracy.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Benzodiazepine withdrawal (Xanax, Valium, Klonopin, Ativan). </p>
<p>They knew in 1994. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7841856/</p>
<p>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/saving-normal/201607/yes-benzos-are-bad-you</p>
<p>‚ÄúBenzo withdrawal is a beast, often terrifying, sometimes dangerous, and almost always drawn out over a very long period of time.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe anxiety and panic experienced by people stopping benzos are usually much worse than the anxiety and panic that initially led to their use. Other common symptoms are irritability, insomnia, tremors, distractibility, sweating, and confusion.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt the extreme, if doses were high and discontinuation is quick, the symptoms resemble alcoholic delirium tremens with hallucinations, psychosis, seizures, and the risk of death.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚Äúand most insidious, but still very damaging, are the day-to-day impacts on brain functioning. On-going benzo use can be devastating‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
