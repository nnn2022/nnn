    <strong>F***ing STASI Wannbes. Why Can't People Just Mind Their Own Damn Business?</strong>
    <p><p>The link below is from my home city's subreddit. The comments are unbelievable - the number of people butthurt because they can't have others hauled away in cuffs for not wearing a face diaper is just pathetic. Wait until they actually get the tyranny they seem to all wish for, and it impacts them personally.</p>
<p>The saddest thing is they don't appear to have even read their own city's bylaw, which specifically spells out exemptions from mask wearing (proof not required)!</p>

        <p>So when Edmonton gets sent back to stage 2 because of too many hospitalizations will you still be shouting about the inhumanity of masks?   You had 2 weeks.  What do you suppose will happen next?   Gee.  I wonder.</p>

        <p>Have you even actually looked at the stats?</p>
<p>0 deaths in the last week. And the week before that. ICU numbers stable for weeks. Hospitalizations haven't gone up much.</p>
<p>As for "cases" - somebody who isn't sick, isn't a "case" - it's wordplay to maintain a state of panic.</p>
<p>The city has mandated masks since 1 August. The incubation period for 'Rona is 2 weeks. If masks actually did anything to stop the spread, "cases" would be going down.</p>
<p>How can you not be even slightly skeptical of what you are being fed?</p>

        <p>UCP government in Alberta is not initiating or maintaining a state of panic.  Woke NNN people having parties are causing spread of this “cold”. People following the gov’ts rules and having 100 people sitting eating at a wedding is causing spread. You running around “resisting” and being your badass self is causing spread. If we go back to stage 2 it’s the attitude of people in this sub that caused it.  Which is ironic because your resistance to the pretty loose rules we had will lead to tighter rules.  When cancer patients can’t get surgery because the hospital is full, you did that.  And if you are right and in a month we are still chugging along at stage 3.  Well then congrats.  You were right.  And if we are not.... well that’s on you.</p>

        <p>Ok. So you haven't looked at the stats.</p>
<p>It's easier just to spew rhetoric. The attitude of "Do as you're told or you get a spanking!" coming from governments and people like yourself is sickening.</p>

        <p>If Alberta has to go backwards, you are the reason plain and simple.  You think you are the smartest guy/gal in the room right?  You know better than everyone else apparently.  Everyone who doesn’t agree with you is a sheep living in fear and is treated with a schoolyard taunt “You aren’t my mom!”   Makes you sound about 15.  </p>
<p>The stats are posted helpfully each day by this guy.  Who doesn’t blather on about the evils of masks and how stupid other people are.   </p>

        <p>Thanks.  That gave me a good laugh.  So many psychologists in the sub!  It’s always the same thing. “You are so afraid!!!!”   </p>
<p>My life currently involves my kids having in person teachers, playing team sports and going shopping when we need stuff. It would be nice to keep it that way instead of having more restrictions come in place because people insist on being badasses thwarting authority. 🤷‍♂️</p>

        <p>Yeah.</p>
<p>My employer moved me out here in 2016. After the initial shock, I was happy - "I'm going out West; I won't have to deal with the Trudeau loving trogs of Ontario any more!!!"</p>
<p>Most people I meet here seem to be pretty based (except for the hipster luvvies downtown - which I avoid like the plague). So I don't understand how the Edmonton subreddit is such a shithole filled with authoritarian loving socialist SJWs.</p>

        <p>I am not a big fan of concerts myself, but most of my friends really like them. One of them in particular was a fierce defender of the lockdown measures, until like july when she realised that the concerts weren't coming back anytime soon, the way things were headed. Lots of people advocate for lockdowns until it impacts something that they like.</p>
