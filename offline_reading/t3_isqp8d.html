    <strong>Advice and suggestions for families dealing with being locked down and social services deeply cut?</strong>
    <p><p>My family and I live in Canada and the government really punished us by failing to understand our mental health and need for my spouse and our children to get out and socialize. Clearly, all of the decisions were made without regard to the average family, and assumptions were made that we could all just enjoy our Zoom chats with high-speed internet (we don't have) and play in our fenced yard (we don't have).</p>
<p>Initially, our parks and recreation areas like beaches were closed. Later on, in the summer they finally opened up but some with heavy restrictions. Now as autumn is starting and the air cools down we are getting ready for a typical Canadian winter, and fear that we are going to be stuck inside. Our schooling was made to be online only, libraries are closed, church activities, and hobby groups restricted.</p>
<p>I'm looking for advice and maybe some stories from some of you who've been able to find activities to get out of the house and that takes care of your mental health. I don't agree with these lockdowns, but there's plenty of hysteria going on right now and threats of further lockdowns and I don't want to get stuck in this again without a plan or resources.</p></p>
