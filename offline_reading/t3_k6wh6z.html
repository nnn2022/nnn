    <strong>Rise in hospitalizations.</strong>
    <p><p>For a while it seemed like the case counts were driving the panic measures but as most of us know it can give an inaccurate picture of the true impact on society since so many (majority?) are asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Hospitalization numbers seem harder to question however I was reflecting on the 3 hospitalizations (friend/family of friend).  In each case, it seems like they were briefly released without incident and it made me wonder if these people really needed to be hospitalized or if it was more a case of "oh shit, I tested positive, I don't want to die".</p>
<p>From what I have heard about the severe cases, they can go bad suddenly.  I'm sure many other people heard the same which will make people much more likely to want to avoid that situation.</p>
<p>TLDR: I wonder what percentage of the rise in hospitalizations are people are spooked as opposed to actually.</p>
<p>I remember being sick as a dog before and feeling like death but have never thought to go to a hospital because I know it will pass.  I'm guessing corona presents a lot of uncertainty on whether it will actually pass so people are erring on the side of caution and getting hospitalized with the background of the rising case counts we hear about ringing in their head.</p>
<p>Anyways, does anyone else have any hospitalization anecdotes or thoughts?  It would be bad if care rationing was necessary but all of the panic from my local area (SF Bay Area) is based on projections of running out of hospital beds (Christmas day I believe is their projection).</p></p>

        <p>My question would be ..</p>
<p>How is it that the USA and Germany both had such radically different responses to Covid, and radicallly different healthcare situations, and such different numbers, and yet here we are now in December and both countries seem to be at exactly the same place?</p>
<p>"You couldnt follow the rules, and so now we have all these cases, and we predict that we will run out of hospital beds in 2 weeks. So we need to lockdown harder."</p>
<p>Same exact story.</p>

        <p>I questioned this the other day with my husband. We were ungodly sick in February and told we had the "flu". Our almost 1 year old was so sick and struggled to breathe. They told us it was a virus and had to run its course and there was nothing they could do for us. No medicine, no treatment plan besides alternate tylenol/motrin and try and stay hydrated. </p>
<p>Strange, that now that covid is a thing, its easy to get into the hospital even if it likely can be treated at home. I just find it odd now looking back at how sick my family was and the way it was normal to send you on your way to deal with at home that there is a huge possibility half these people don't even need to be in there.</p>
