    <strong>Remember: You can't convert a pro-masker or pro-lockdowner. They are conspiracy theorists and simply don't live in reality</strong>
    <p><p>The BlueAnon conspiracy theory is all-too-common and has a firm grip on the minds of the left. It's a loose group of politicians, media personalities, and social media activists who believe that:  </p>
<ul>
<li>A piece of fabric strapped to your face is a force-field that stops a virus in its tracks</li>
<li>Trump supporters are meeting and planning to storm the capitol and kill lawmakers any day now</li>
<li>A bunch of people taking selfies was an insurrection, even though unlike every insurrection in human history they didn't bring guns</li>
<li>That an organized mob of people who burned American cities to the ground were actually protesting peacefully</li>
<li>Governmental policies that oppress the people such as mask mandates and lockdown orders are actually designed to help them</li>
<li>Cops are going around hunting blacks and high-fiving each other after each kill</li>
<li>A widely debunked pseudoscientific theory that skin colors carry personality traits is real, and that white skin carries negative ones and the only way to fix it is to be racist towards whites</li>
<li>Kavanaugh is a gang rapist</li>
<li>Trump is a Russian asset</li>
<li>Biden is the most popular president in history</li>
<li>Dr. Suess is part of a racist cabal that is trying to oppress blacks across time and space</li>
<li>An experimental vaccine that was developed in less than a year is safe</li>
<li>Lockdowns prevent viral spread, even though it's common knowledge that the only reasons viruses spread in winter during normal times is because people spend more time indoors and less time getting fresh air</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, can you even imagine what kind of life you would lead if you actually, genuinely, 100% believed that all of the above is true? You would act just as insane as they do. BlueAnon is a terrible cult, and I hope leftists can wake up from it.</p></p>

        <p>While I completely agree with your extensive points outlining some of their stupidity, don't hold the defeatist attitude that you cannot "convert" someone.  </p>
<p>What's most effective is to lay upon simple facts that help shatter their core assumptions.  If the vaccine works, why is the CDC saying it does not "prevent transmission"?  Even if it works to "protect you", all these restrictions are to "prevent transmission" so do you want to live indefinitely under a state of totalitarianism?  </p>
<p>Bigger still, are people that have been so pro-solitary confinement and other broad restrictions, is they tend to say "now that I'm vaccinated I can do X Y Z!"  To those people, I make sure to only continue conversing with them if they're willing to admit they are now breaking "CDC guidelines" that have been their bible so far. </p>
<p>Of course, the political entity CDC has reacted politically by some small, virtually meaningless "okay you can do such and such".  However, it's still such a tiny chipping away at their broad removal of freedom, that everyone I know who was suddenly "OH I'm <em>vaccinated</em> now I can live my life" were still planning on breaking them as they are.  Not to mention that it's this kind of pressure that puts the CDC in a position of pulling back.  </p>
<p>We need to keep on, point out the hypocrisies and the logical failings like you list, and some people will start to wake up.  In the meantime, just living our lives like normal provides enough counter evidence that they stop believing the lies in itself.  I've converted at least one doomer when they realized I've been acting normal, and haven't died or developed some debilitating heart condition.</p>

        <p>I'm all for pointing out hypocrisy, but it's explicitly stating you "can't convert" these people.  I don't really feel comfortable letting that stand without reminding people that, no, you definitely can convert people to reality and we need to continue to converse with those around us.</p>

        <p>Greetings, brave traveller. I see you've set off on an audacious quest to wake those who sleep as they wonder the earth, to which I applaud. I used to be a truther like you, until everyone around me took a knee. To help you along the way, please, <a href="https://lbry.tv/COVID-Deception:b">take my knowledge</a>. I hope that one day this world will be rid of doomers, and I may walk freely, without living in constant fear of being ambushed by a flock of Karens, but until that day comes, I wish you the best of luck. Safe travels.</p>

<p>&rt; From FDA.gov:
&rt; From February through the middle of May, the FDA issued a total of 59 EUAs for IVDs for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 based on validation data using contrived specimens derived from SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. As the pandemic progressed and more patient specimens became available, on May 11, 2020, <strong>the FDA recommended in the Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests that developers obtain and use patient specimens to validate their tests.</strong> So just from Feb-May 59 tests were authorized (so how many since then?) and the FDE recommended testing against real samples.  </p>
<p><strong>I can‚Äôt believe they would actually allow test developers to obtain and use patient specimens to validate their tests without isolating, purifying and examining under an electron microscope. UNREAL.</strong>  </p>

<hr>
<p>&rt; ‚ÄúI think if a country said, ‚ÄúYou know, we need to end this epidemic,‚Äù They could quietly send around a memo saying: ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt be having the cutoff at 37. If we put it at 32, the number of positive tests drops dramatically. If it‚Äôs still not enough, well, you know, 30 or 28 or something like that. So, you can control the sensitivity.‚Äù  </p>
<p>&rt; <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/">Yes, you read that right. Labs can manipulate how many ‚Äúcases‚Äô of Covid-19 their country has. Is this how the Chinese made their case load vanish all of a sudden?</a>  </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Jessica C. Watson from Bristol University confirms this. In her paper ‚ÄúInterpreting a COVID-19 test result‚Äù, published recently in The British Medical Journal, she writes that there is a ‚Äúlack of such a clear-cut ‚Äògold-standard‚Äô for COVID-19 testing.‚Äù  </p>
<p>&rt;But instead of classifying the tests as unsuitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection and COVID-19 diagnosis, or instead of pointing out that only a virus, proven through isolation and purification, can be a solid gold standard, Watson claims in all seriousness that, ‚Äúpragmatically‚Äù COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, ‚Äúmay be the best available ‚Äògold standard‚Äô.‚Äù But this is not scientifically sound.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&rt;Hence, we have asked the science teams of the relevant papers which are referred to in the context of SARS-CoV-2 for proof whether the electron-microscopic shots depicted in their in vitro experiments show purified viruses.  </p>
<p>&rt;But not a single team could answer that question with ‚Äúyes‚Äù ‚Äî and NB., nobody said purification was not a necessary step. We only got answers like <a href="https://bpa-pathology.com/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/">‚ÄúNo, we did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification‚Äù</a>   </p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Countless labs have reported a 100 percent positivity rate, which means every single person tested was positive. Other labs had very high positivity rates. FOX 35 News found that testing sites like one local Centra Care reported that 83 people were tested and all tested positive. Then, NCF Diagnostics in Alachua reported 88 percent of tests were positive.  </p>
<p>&rt;How could that be? FOX 35 News investigated these astronomical numbers, contacting every local location mentioned in the report.  </p>
<p>&rt;The report showed that Orlando Health had a 98 percent positivity rate. However, when FOX 35 News contacted the hospital, they confirmed errors in the report. <a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/fox-35-investigates-florida-department-of-health-says-some-labs-have-not-reported-negative-covid-19-results">Orlando Health's positivity rate is only <strong>9.4 percent, not 98 percent</strong> as in the report.</a>   </p>

<p>&rt;Development of new vaccine technology has been plagued with problems in the past. The current RNA based SARS- CoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long term safety testing. In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients. The RNA sequence of the vaccine as well as the spike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations. The results indicate that the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations. In the current analysis a total of sixteen UG tandem repeats (Œ®GŒ®G) were identified and additional UG (Œ®G) rich sequences were identified. Two GGŒ®A sequences were found. Potential G Quadruplex sequences are possibly present but a more sophisticated computer program is needed to verify these. Furthermore, the spike protein, created by the translation of the vaccine RNA, binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a zinc containing enzyme. This interaction has the potential to increase intracellular zinc. Zinc ions have been shown to cause the transformation of TDP-43 to its pathologic prion configuration. The folding of TDP-43 and FUS into their pathologic prion confirmations is known to cause ALS, front temporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and other neurological degenerative diseases. The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.  </p>

        <p>&rt;Religion has convinced people that there's an invisible man ... living in the sky. Who watches everything you do every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a list of ten specific things he doesn't want you to do. And if you do any of these things, he will send you to a special place, of burning and fire and smoke and torture and anguish for you to live forever, and suffer, and suffer, and burn, and scream, until the end of time. But he loves you. He loves you. He loves you and he needs money.</p>

        <p>as people become less religious they become more likely to pick up cult like behavior and get addicted to "facebook" causes. People orginally tried to blame religion, but it is really more human nature.

<p>BlueAnon has cult members working for Reddit and every other tech company. They have dangerous conspiratorial thinking and they can't handle dissent. The reason my #4 account got suspended was "for promoting hate". Go figure. That's how you know that what I'm saying is correct.</p>

        <p>Pretty much my entire friend circle is very pro-lockdown and I took up the challenge a few weeks ago to see if I can convince them.         <br>
It was a massive failure. They seemed so shocked when I'm explaining that we will inevitably have to live with this forever and how the death rate is much, much lower than profit-driven media. I did have one friend that agreed with what I said, although he is currently living in Florida so it was easier for him to understand.          <br>
The only way pro-lockdown people will change is if they start thinking critically. I was never pro-lockdown to begin with but I did agree with some light restrictions at the beginning of the pandemic, but after realizing how "2 weeks to flatten the curve" was a massive scam I massively started questioning the way governments around the world were handling this.</p>

        <p>The reason they can't be reasoned with is because they've already made up their minds, and they are holding a religious belief in "The Science^(TM)".  There's no logic with cult members.</p>

        <p>So let's ignore the pipe bombs and the zip cuffs in the capitol building, let's look at the "cities burned to the ground" and they're still okay because right wing media blew it out of proportion, let's just ignore the fact that doctors used masks for decades in hospitals in order not to infect immunocomprimised patients and themselves. The only conspiracy theorists here is you guys lmao. I really can't believe that you guys think you're the smartest of the bunch yet don't believe 99% of doctors, scientists and specialists. Jesus you guys project your insecurities like you took years to study this particular topic. Politics aside is there actually any epidemiologists or doctors here?</p>

        <p>Lmao fucking zip-cuffs and pipe bombs sure make it seem like there was real danger. Also there's nothing called "BlueAnon" mate, if the left did have conspiracy theory nutcases like the right, we sure as shit wouldn't have named it after you guy's weirdo cult. Now keep being a little baby who doesn't acknowledge that doctors wear masks for 12 hour shifts to protect themselves against diseases and to protect immunocomprimised patients.</p>
<p>Get help, these weirdo cult guys have you in their grasp and they're making you antagonise doctors, specialists, epidemiologists, harvard studies, and basically everyone in order to feel like you're superior in some way. Truth is you're not, never were, deal with it and move on with the rest of humanity. Or keep thinking this weird conspiracy against masks/vaccines is correct.</p>

Well again get help and join the rest of the world in not being afraid of a piece of cloth around your mouth so you don't spread germs during a pandemic. And listen to 99.9% of the doctors and specialists around the world not just the one <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/07/demon-sex-donald-trump">That believes in demon sperm that trump used as his expert</a> . You can nitpick and cry all day long but the facts are clear. </p>
<p>There was pipe bombs and zipties in the capitol building. A police officer was beaten to death there. Grow up and wear a fucking mask like the rest of the world does during a pandemic. Doctors do it for 12 hour shifts to protect their elderly and immunocomprimised patients. "THE LEFT WANTS TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS DURING A PANDEMIC" is the accurate ben shapiro headline for this situation.</p>
