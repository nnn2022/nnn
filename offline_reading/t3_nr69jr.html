    <strong>An organization who fights for the people?</strong>
    <p><p>I'll be honest. I do love the idea that we all gather here and talk about how we see things. We see that the world is being robbed of it's freedom, for freedom to be swiped under the rug from the people's feet and into the hands of future tyrants and authoritarians. This is the first step. When people speak out, that's when you know they're worried. </p>
<p>But when will we truly fight back? We see these people rule from behind the faces of governments and presidents and world leaders and making them into their puppets behind the shadows. But who is working behind the shadows for the people? Where are we? We've already built up a community here and I know we don't have the money and resources to even begin to mount a legal fight against the system that is.</p>
<p>I hate to say it but is violence the only true answer?</p>
<p>It's not like they really cared for us when they sent Americans to die for no reason in Iraq. </p>
<p>Or in Tuskagee for the minorities. </p>
<p>The land oppresses all and the rich rob the poor.</p>
<p>And trust me- I don't want violence and not advocating but I wouldn't say that it wouldn't be a possibility in the future when people get fed up and sick of it. I'll gladly give a hand then.</p></p>

        <p>Nobody in this community advocates for any kind of violence. I would suggest that you refrain from suggesting that we should considering that would be the perfect reason for reddit to take down this sub.</p>
<p>Also, information is our greatest tool. Knowledge is power. Simple as that.</p>

        <p>I live in California and while most people are sheep I frequently run into people who feel the same way we do in this sub. There are MANY of us and I believe that a movement will coalesce soon. Violence is a trap we can't fall into. Look what the media and the left did with Jan 6th. We have to look for leaders, or even better BECOME the leaders we are looking for. Run for office. Speak out at school board/community meetings. Organize peaceful protests. Keep resisting. NO is a powerful word.</p>
