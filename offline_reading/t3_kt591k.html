    <strong>Notes from an activist (or doomer/sheeple/living in fear in your eyes)</strong>
    <p><p>Whether it's:</p>
<p>Doomer or Anti-Masker</p>
<p>Sheeple or Conspiracy Theorist</p>
<p>Living in fear of "a virus no worse than the flu" or living in fear of "a permanent dystopian new normal"</p>
<p>All that serves to do is split people further, and shut us all out from hearing and discussing the things we have in common. </p>
<p>The root issue for many of us is how governments and societies run. And if you choose a random issue, people on both "sides" will still share that basic concern. The more fighting between any two "sides" on any issue, the less we are fighting against the actual problems. </p>
<p>Why is "no new normal" about masks and lockdowns and vaccines, about doomers and sheeple (and not living in fear of a virus, but instead end up living in fear and depression about the future) not about changing the root issue so that there could never be a "new normal"? </p>
<p>Major spoiler: the other "side" doesn't want a "new normal" either. They are largely just more cautious, and will more willingly accept discomfort and delayed gratification in the short-term if they perceive enough benefit. </p>
<p>I stopped a literal train because the multinational corporation behind it was in the wrong in my eyes. What are you doing to stop the root of the problems you see? </p>
<p>I'd love for there to be a place where those of us who want to spearhead major changes could meaningfully discuss and work on that, regardless of (and separate from) our stances on lesser issues.</p></p>

<p>I would say they are not considering the ramifications of everything that is happening, and are walking step-by-step into a place they will not be able to back themselves out of.</p>
<p>You can say people like me are wrong and "paranoid". But we were the ones who were talking about slippery slopes and moving goalposts and unending lockdowns and ("almost") mandatory vaccines at a time that most people were happily chirping "Oh it's just 2 weeks to flatten the curve. <em>Calm down</em> you conspiracy nuts!"</p>

        <p>I and most people I know never thought it would be “just 2 weeks”. </p>
<p>But I also disagree that we are headed to a place we can’t get back out of.</p>
<p>I guess time will only tell on that one. </p>
<p>RemindMe! 1 year.</p>

<p>Your virtue is well signaled. Thank you for stopping by.</p>

        <p>“Virtue Signalling</p>
<p>To take a conspicuous but essentially useless action ostensibly to support a good cause but actually to show off how much more moral you are than everybody else.”</p>
<p>How did you come to the conclusion that my action was useless? What do you think were the results of my actions? </p>
<p>How did you decide my motivations in doing said action? </p>
<p>Why do you assume I am trying to appear “more moral” as opposed to being “more likely to act effectively”?</p>
