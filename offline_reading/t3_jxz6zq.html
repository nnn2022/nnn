    <strong>The Great Reset is the globalist's final attempt to restrain the rising consciousness of humanity (and what happens when it fails)</strong>
    <p><p>The people who run this current system can see they are losing their grasp on humanity. I completely respect if you disagree with me, but I believe Covid is no virus but a final Hail-Mary attempt to continue controlling the masses with the most draconian methods they can imagine. </p>
<p>This is The Great Reset- it is not them being absurdly confident in their control so that they are willing to do whatever they want. It is a profound desperation in knowing they are losing their grip on the hearts of individuals.</p>
<p>It will seem to succeed at first. This next decade will be very dark. They will be throwing everything they can at us because they know this is their last chance to consolidate their power. People WILL die. As the Globalists see their system and lifestyles falling apart, they will lash back at us for not supporting them anymore.</p>
<p>The people who can survive this upcoming war will be responsible for rebuilding humanity after this system falls. I truly pray for everyone, especially you who reads this. Things are going to get very interesting very quickly.</p></p>

        <p>Step by step plan to enslave the people, genocide them and save the planet so only the rich can enjoy it:<br>
- Make everybody afraid to live together<br>
- Force people to stay home and make them stop shopping with cash as much as you can<br>
- Isolate them so they cannot get together and revolt<br>
- Bring on the cashless society<br>
- Control how people can get and spend money (Credit score, forced vaccination to get an income)<br>
- Keep the threat of other viruses alive to make people understand that their human body needs to be enhanced<br>
- Once people are ready, mandate brain implants to read thoughts and rid humans of their selfish and individualist nature to fully manipulate them<br>
- Develop enough AI and robots to replace humans. Robot police and soldiers will have no remorse for killing people.<br>
- Elite seats on the clean beach sipping pina coladas.</p>

        <p>Tbh, if you keep thinking like this you will be controlled by nothing except your intrusive thoughts. I have anxiety and depression so I know what It feels like to be consumed by them at times. The more you think about it the more your brain starts to believe it's true and can damage you in ways that area life long, so please get help if you can &lt;3. Besides they already have systems already in place to do all these things, capitalism gives way for corruption to utterly take over and few ways to fight back.</p>
