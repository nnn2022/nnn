    <strong>Everyday I wish I died from covid19</strong>
    <p><p>Everyday I wish I died from covid19 </p>
<p>During the lockdown there was stories of NHS nurses,  doctors and people working in care homes who died from covid19 . There was story of the nurse who died really got to me. The nurse  was woman in her 30s and she was a married mum of 3 children. When I read her story I was so upset because she had so much to live for ie married,  children and she had a purpose in life which was to heal. I felt like it wasn't fair that am alive and she wasn't. I am someone who should not be alive. I have nothing to live for ie unemployed, single, childless and just an embrassment to my family. One of relatives are getting married and everyone in the family is talking about her upcoming wedding. I have 24 and failed to have it all together. I am alive  in a world in which I don't know where I truly belong. </p>
<p>I don't know my true purpose in life and I am not made for this world. I am not cool celebrity influencer that everybody loves, I am not the pretty  woman on Love Island UK that men want , I am not a high profile social activist we see on Time magazine or the successful people on the forbes under 30 powerlist. I am just a unconventional woman who struggles to fit in modern society and doesn't know she truly belongs.</p>
<p>I am outsider amoung women my age group as I have never experienced  the things they have in their lifetime.
I cant relate to  people  in my age group especially women my age. Most women my age have had the first boyfriend and lost their virginity when they  were  teeangers. I have never been in relationship and I am still a virgin. Women my age have this sense of sister hood where as I have always felt excluded  by women. </p>
<p>All the people who died from covid19 especially within my family were just good people with so much to live for. I am not a bad person but I am not a great person either. </p>
<p>If I could I would give my good health to someone ill  from covid19 so they can live and be with their families and spouses again.</p></p>

        <p>I am so sorry you are suffering like this but this sounds like classic depression. It makes sense that you would feel like this since the life of a typical 24 year old should be living is not possible right now but try to realize that most of this is probably situational. I am guessing that you really want this situation and these feelings to die, the feeling of being worthless, having no value, not fitting in Etc. You probably don't want to actually physically die, there's a difference. None of us know what the future will bring but just as good times Never Last neither do bad times. You have many more years of life ahead of you, why not stick around and see what's coming? It won't be all bad</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry. I feel the same way a lot. I’m 27 and have had no relationships, don’t have a full time job, still live at home, and I feel like I have nothing to live for a lot of the time. I thought I’d be married with kids by the time I was 25. It makes me so depressed seeing other women my age with their lives together and actually happy. I don’t know what that feels like. I struggle with depression so I know that factors into how I see the world. I’m thinking of starting therapy again soon. Haven’t been in years.</p>

        <p>I’m 25 and am in a similar spot, I feel like I don’t fit in much with people that are my age. Just as I was figuring my purpose out COVID happened and suddenly I can’t pursue my dream career if I don’t get the COVID vaccine. It’s really broken me down and I don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I’m not the happy go lucky kid I once was.</p>
<p>But even in this cruel world there is always a reason to be thankful that you are alive and healthy. We may be different from our peers and have different values and life circumstances, but we aren’t less worthy because of that. We deserve love and happiness, and we should never feel undeserving of these things because we don’t fit the societal mold of what it means to be a man or woman in their 20’s.</p>
<p>I’ve been planning on giving Reddit a break, because the doom and gloom can be all consuming and cause feelings of hopelessness and doubt if you start to neglect your mental health and can’t ground yourself in the present moment. It’s hard, like a train wreck that you can’t look away from, but I need to prioritize my peace of mind, and I think you should to. </p>
<p>Try to embrace your uniqueness and be proud of the fact that you are different from the rest. There are plenty of people out there that are attracted to people like you and you should consider it a strength. Never apologize for being who you really are. Stay strong!!</p>

        <p>Hey I’m 24M in U.K. </p>
<p>No matter how bad the day is it’s always worth seeing what tomorrow brings. It could be the best day of your life but you just don’t know it. Same for next week, month, year. You won’t know if you don’t stick it out.</p>
<p>I went through a rough patch a few months ago but found peace through walking daily. Hmu should you wanna chat</p>
