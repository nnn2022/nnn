    <strong>Asking for help reasoning with family</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, I'm from Brazil. I'm nineteen years old. </p>
<p>Im currently living with my mother (61) and grandma (93). As I speak, since the pandemic began, I only went to the beach twice and a friend's party. Here in Brazil things are relatively chill now, most restrictions are lifted.</p>
<p>However, every time I want to go out my mother storms at me and says my carelessness will kill her and/or my grandmother. Most of my friends have gone to multiple parties, had dates, girls over, etc etc. But that is not my case. Any ideas on arguments or things I could say to my mom in order to maker her chill a little bit?</p>
<p>I tried them all: It's most likely grandma will die from any other desease than from getting COVID from me. She's 93 also so I don't know what's the big deal. May I add that from my social circle almost 85% ALREADY HAVE HAD COVID-19, so they are most likely immune.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading</p></p>

        <p>It‘s pretty hard to reason with ppl that are convinced you‘ll kill them because of covid...</p>
<p>But, a starting point would be to hang out with a close group of friends that you know are healthy.</p>

<p>That might be the best sentiment. "Are you accusing me of trying to kill you? Do you really think I hate you that much? I'm just trying to live my live and I don't believe that I'm endangering you in any way by doing so".</p>

        <p>I would tell your parents that your grandmother has already had a good life. It's nice to make her as comfortable as possible in the twilight of her life, but it's your life that is the goose that lays the golden egg.</p>
<p>You still have things to learn, people to meet, challenges to overcome, wealth to be made and lost and most crucially for humanity, your offspring will continue the human race. If you were to have a turn like many young people are suffering from now and commit suicide because of isolation, hopelessness and depression you won't only kill yourself, but you'll kill off your whole family line.</p>
<p>So, grandma dies= grandma dies</p>
<p>young person dies= end of familial line</p>
<p>You are important, and sorry, not sorry boomers, you're more important than boomers.</p>

        <p>&rt;  ALREADY HAVE HAD COVID-19, so they are most likely immune.</p>
<p>I very much doubt that. You most likely had PCR tests which don't tell you if you have covid, they don't even tell you if you definitely have SARS-CoV-2. These PCR tests were never meant to be used as a diagnostic tool, it's a research tool. Their accuracy is below 50%. </p>
<p>As for how to deal with family, well, all I can think of is to show confidence in your position. Debate is most likely pointless and merely leads to people entrenching themselves further into their position. The only thing that can help is to show them, with your behavior and manner of keeping yourself, that the virus doesn't scare you. Don't tell them you're going to the beach, just go, don't bring it up, and if it happens to come up a few days or weeks later in conversation you can show them that yeah you went out and no one died. A miracle!</p>
<p>Alternatively she might be perceptive to what my grandma told us when the first lockdown approached my country: "If they're going to lock up <em>my</em> family for <em>my</em> safety, I'd rather kill myself".</p>

        <p>My mom is exactly like yours and also she's been a heavy smoker for 20 years.</p>
<p>One day she was shouting me because I wasn't protecting her enough from the virus and I dead ass told her: You are telling me to protect you but you have been smoking for 20 years and I can't protect you from a respiratory disease if you smoke.</p>
<p>She hasn't bother me ever since, what I recommend to you it's to just say that you are going out with your mask/face shield or whatever when you go out or create a comeback like that.</p>

        <p>&rt; She's 93 also so I don't know what's the big deal. </p>
<p>You tried arguing with your mother that it's no big deal if her mother dies because she's old. </p>
<p>Did you try telling her she's kind of old too so you don't care if she dies either?</p>
