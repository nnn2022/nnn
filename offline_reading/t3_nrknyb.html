    <strong>Through The Looking-Glass</strong>
    <p><p>I  am in no way suggesting brigading or anything like that as you can see  the mods of that sub are basically deleting any post contrary to their  narrative. But if you want your mind blown read some of the comments in  this thread. I cannot understand how people are reconciling these  recent*  revelations in the way they are.</p>

        <p>We call these specimens sheep. They blindly follow whatever the omnipotent overlords instruct them as correct. They have no ability to do any form of deductive reasoning, nor do they dare question what they are told as being fact. </p>
<p>Any human of rational mind and body should realize that questioning the status quo is not a bad thing.</p>

        <p>I’ve read as much of the emails as I can and they really aren’t that damning. The worst I could find were:</p>
<p>One page 3187, he’s first shown the lab-leak theory, and he sends it along to another researcher for more information</p>
<p>On pages 3147 and 3123 he receives emails with links to a study from India that claims the virus was spliced with HIV to spread more, but he debunks it and points out it’s not peer-reviewed, published, and didn’t stand up to replication. He links them to a debunking article.</p>
<p>On page 3087 he identifies for another researcher the background of the virus, explaining the likelihood of it coming from a bat and/or pangolin at a Wet Market.</p>
<p>Bonus: On page 1770 he reacts to merch made in his image.</p>
<p>Here are the pages of the leaked emails: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20793561-leopold-nih-foia-anthony-fauci-emails?fbclid=IwAR2aZUmNotVdU_RuTrXaXH2jqSOOkQP7Mi-pf8C6K87nU_jD2eyXeKjzARU (they’re in reverse-chronological order)</p>
<p>He said he didn’t think masks were needed and that symptomatic spread was the largest means for transmission, but that was on February 5th, a month before COVID hit the US, two months before we had solid data, and three month before the NIH updated their recommendations with the new published data.</p>
