    <p><p>It isn't helpful to start freaking out on them with mean comments. They're kids. Everyone in their life who they're supposed to trust are failing them right now. Why be a dick to them? Think about it from their perspective. Don't chase them off because of some tribal knee-jerk reaction you may have. You don't need to feel insecure here. You're not in r/Coronavirus or wherever the fuck. Calm down. Breathe deep. And let's try to help people out.</p>

I can't recommend it highly enough. It's a short read. Please share it with anyone who wants to better understand what's going on here.</p></p>

        <p>I can't imagine how scary it must be for children to see adults panic like this. Adults brought me comfort when I was scared, but now kids are seeing the adults in their lives running around shitting their pants from made up fake shit.</p>
<p>I can't imagine seeing this sorry ass generation faced with something like WWII..... Thank God we had brave men back then not a bunch of fat virgin neckbeard cowards in moms basement spreading doom and fear on reddit</p>

        <p>This is a tough one. I cared a lot about politics and current events when I was in high school... but I didn’t wander up to adults and call them “fucking morons” when they didn’t agree with me. It’s a little hard for me to wrap my mind around. And yeah wtf with the Toy Story memes.</p>

        <p>Of course there are many trolls but some of them aren't. They're confused and have been manipulated to think "dumb hicks who refuse to wear masks" are why we aren't back to normal yet. People who are shown that they've been so misled tend to be a bit resentful of those who manipulated them and can end up becoming the fiercest of allies.</p>

        <p>They're going to try to get this sub banned whether we are mean to them or not, but I think treating them with the respect the don't give us is at least more likely to get them to consider considering our perspective. Snapping  back only reaffirms their opinions of us which in turn makes them a lot more resistant to ever giving our perspective a chance. But hey this is reddit not the UN so do what you want.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I’m a young person here, I’m frustrated and upset with the sheep who have allowed this mess to go on for as long as it has.  I have some more liberal-minded friends who don’t see the problem with government mandates and abuse of power, and I always present my view calmly with research and facts.  I think at least a few of them have begun to question things, even if I haven’t changed their minds entirely.</p>
<p>I made this account today because I passed the point of being fed up sometime in April, and it’s well past time I speak up about it.  I can live in a big city, alone, completely surrounded by everyone my age and in my school and at my jobs acting like obedient sheep, and still think for myself as a young person.  People shouldn’t get a pass just because they blindly follow their peers or the media.</p>

        <p>No one is advocating that we give them an open-ended pass. I'm asking that you try engaging them a bit and consider the amount of propaganda they're up against (and when propaganda isn't sufficient naked censorship is deployed to sure up the gaps.) Not everyone is a very well-practiced independent thinker. It's not a universal skill. If you happened to be great at basketball but people around you sucked would you just never play with them or would you try to give them some pointers?</p>

        <p>Right, I agree with you, I just probably don’t have nearly as much room for patience or empathy as the average person.  My first approach is always calm logic and reasoning, along with facts and research.  If people immediately respond with snark or irrational emotion, I pretty much assume they’re a lost cause.</p>

        <p>If they respond with snark or irrational emotion, just reply by wishing them a great day and then move on. </p>
<p>Think about how that appears to others: </p>
<p>You: calm logic and reasoning, backed up by facts </p>
<p>Them: insults and emotional appeals </p>
<p>You: a civil end to the interaction </p>

<p>You only have maybe a few hours a week to convince someone, meanwhile they're being flooded with propaganda the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Even if you change their mind for an hour, they're back to dunce after a few days being beat on the head with garbage.</p>

        <p>I will admit, they can get a little aggressive. However, even if a mask helps prevent 1% of cases, it could still save at least one life by simply having people wear it. It doesn’t take much effort to wear one and causes much more good than harm.</p>

<p>Going off of the parent post, could someone simply explain your issues with mandates such as these, which in my point of view could lower the risk of death instead of everyone simply downvoting without voicing any sort of opinion of their own?</p>

        <p>The problem is they are mandates. If you choose to wear a mask, fair enough, but it should NOT be up to the government to decide what I can and cannot wear. It's also you who thinks it's not a big deal to wear one. As someone on the spectrum with sensory issues, it's absolutely a big deal to wear one as I don't even wear hats and scarves and never have because they overwhelm me. Even tho this would give me an exemption, people are not responding to that. People view anyone not wearing a mask as a walking bag of disease and are harassing people regardless. Why should my mental health suffer because I'm assumed sick when I'm not indefinitely? If I have no symptoms, the chance of me infecting someone just by walking past them in the bread aisle is next to zero.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the thing with masks is you think they work one way, right? You think wearing them protects others and not yourself? The reason for this is supposedly eye droplets. First, there is no evidence of asymptomatic spread so mass-masking the healthy already makes no sense. However, if you're considered at risk or you're genuinely worried about catching covid, why can you not wear both a mask and goggles? The reality is nobody wants to wear a mask. This is so obvious in places without a mandate because hardly anyone wears them. So instead of forcing literally everyone to wear something they don't want to wear, how about you explain to people that you can wear masks and goggles and be fully protected yourself?</p>
<p>I saw one of your other comments saying cloth masks don't fully protect which is why everyone needs to wear one, but if we only masked the at-risk and people who want to wear one, there'd be no problem with the government giving out n95's. It wouldn't cause a shortage. The reason they're not recommended right now is because of mass-masking and the shortage it would cause for actual healthcare workers if everyone had to wear one.</p>

        <p>Its easy to start with such intentions but after getting insulted over and over again its difficult to maintain this outlook. I try to remember that these people are victims of a global psyop and propaganda bombardment too.</p>
<p>And then I think about all the “second order effects” (a term invented to dodge responsibility - they’re not direct consequences they’re just secondary effects!); withheld treatments, preventable deaths, all the lives ruined, so far and in future. Just to funnel more wealth and power to the top and these idiots <em>beg</em> for it.</p>
<p>They tell us we’re the killers while the policies they mindlessly champion kill long-term care patients, stress and depress grandma and cause bankruptcies left right and centre.</p>
<p>They willingly lap up the government and social media propaganda because it tells them they’re good and virtuous for turning against their own kind in the empty promises of safety and security.</p>
<p>So we have to ask ourselves: to what extent should we hold them complicit in not only consenting but enforcing this?</p>
<p>The answer may not be a comfortable one and I’m still wrestling with it myself.</p>
<p>They can wake up any time. Let go of the dependency, of the fear and the rage. Life feels much better that way. But the longer they choose to ravenously suckle on the illusion the more their ego and sense of identity become attached to it.</p>
<p>If you can keep up the compassion even then, well you’ve got a gleaming soul in you however I would argue that bluntness and aggression are needed to make some people stop and think, even if its some time after the argument.</p>
<p>Be nice to those who are lost. They seem most susceptible to that. Bare your teeth to those who make the choice to betray you, your family and friends and <em>each other</em>.</p>
<p>There’s so much at stake and peace and love won’t cut it while the enemy continues to advance lock-step. Sometimes the most loving thing you can do is put your foot down.</p>

        <p>I get it. I remember being a teenager and young adult. I’m not too distant from their generation. We were brought up in social media. Our world is reactionism. Our brains literally need more stimulation because we’re addicted to this shit. And, you get acceptance for believing this stuff.</p>
<p>Sadly, young people are the easiest to brainwash. You do well in school by obeying authority. Through experience you start to realize things aren’t as you’re taught. Some people never figure it out.</p>

        <p>I think an important argument tactic is to remind them that being anti-mask doesn't necessarily mean you <em>don't</em> wear a mask.  It is required at all indoor public places where I live and I haven't seen someone without a mask inside in <em>months</em>, and even then it was just one group of teenagers.</p>
<p>Politicians and the media have created this idea that this is all still going on because people are refusing to wear their masks.  Mask compliance appears to be at 100% in places where legally required where I live, but the virus hasn't gone away (the numbers are extremely low but I believe that has nothing to do with the mask).</p>

        <p>I'm most certainly in the outlier group. I grew up in a liberal area, then went to a very liberal college and graduated with an English degree. Most people with my influences would also be liberal, but I am not. I firmly believe in compromising, debating and respecting differences. 
OP, I respect your words. But you're also excusing young people like myself from thinking for themselves. I'm an outlier who doesn't follow the herd and doesn't yell Fuck you or Fuck Trump everyday. No, I welcome constructive criticisms on both ends (I'm not 100% conservative either). I think most Americans, young or old, would benefit greatly if they put their minds to use instead of basing their opinions solely on the herd or what the media says.</p>

<p>I'm not saying it's hopeless that they'll change their minds. In fact, I think our numbers have gone up due to brigades from other subs and it's awesome. However, if the people who blame us truly cared to understand, I would think they would read through the various posts with links to research and data that support our position. It doesn't seem like many of them do. </p>
<p>I don't know how to argue empathetically against insults anymore.</p>
<p>Many of us here have strained or lost relationships with people we know in real life just because we don't agree with them or adhere to the mandates religiously. Relationships with people we've known most of our lives, filled with tension or completely gone. Then we get online and we still deal with gaslighting whether it's reddit, twitter, or instagram. It's hard to get away from it.</p>
<p>I've only been on reddit I think 2 months now. It appears the people blaming us don't really care about the issue at hand. But they seem to be into tribalist attacks for their own pleasure and because they have public opinion on their side, they are protected.</p>
<p>The main reason I have a hard time empathizing with them is because I wouldn't react the same way they do. I don't have a bully or authoritarian mindset. I would never go to a flat earth sub calling them names even though I don't agree. I don't get pleasure thinking I'm better than anyone. So I agree with you. No point of going off on people because they are acting childish, but I'm saving my empathy for the actual lives ruined.</p>

        <p>Remember that all these people are scared of questioning their own beliefs and probably have never dealt with hardship before. That's why they are so emotional and irrational. They are children who need someone to say "everything is gonna be okay" esentially. Having this perspective has helped me at least.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of visitors to this sub and the impression we make on others have a dramatic effect. If we post right wing conspiracy crap and downvote people with dissenting opinions then we have lost any hope of converting them.</p>
<p>Besides, it is good practice to engage in debate. Sharpen your skills and take on their easy talking points. Practice online might help your real-life encounters.</p>

        <p>No one is telling anyone Masks work 100% of the time if they are they aren't reading the data.  But the work to deter.  Its like a grenade.  If I throw a gerenade and then someone lands on top of it.. it will still explode but the damage will be less.  There's no merit to the Herd Immunity theory either.  We do live with the flu but we have widely available treatments for the flu and even vaccines which are not 100%.  (Notice I said widely available, the mixtures and and treatments given to the president are not widely available and most are expirmental). </p>
<p>I get people in here don't want to wear them so I propose this.  We have a set area for anti maskers to go to school and a set area for people who wear masks to go to school and you cannot comingle unless you follow the others rules.  </p>
<p>We don't need to agree but we do need to respect each other's opinons</p>

        <p>You're the first person on the 'other side' I've seen who is even this open-minded.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the vast majority of "pro-maskers" are for using threats and violence to force everyone else to wear masks. I doubt getting a concession from them would be in any way fair. It would look something like "yeah go be maskless in that abandoned rotting building" while they get all the nice locations.</p>
<p>Your idea does have some merit to it, but all the 'go live alone in the woods' and 'you dont deserve healthcare' comments from your side doesn't inspire any honor or trust from your camp.</p>

        <p>No one is saying that would be easy.  You would have to do it fairly.. but at the same time both sides at some point would probably feel spurned over what schools were chosen for kids to go to.  And college is major issue.  But set that aside and how about we just let businesses decide what side they are on.  They can have BIG SIGNAGE saying we're pro masks and other saying you may come without here.  Just so people know which they want to go to.</p>
<p>You want the pro maskers like me to feel safe and not to be threatened that we have no choices either </p>
<p>PS I'm 37 with two kids and a wife.  alot of the people you are arguing with are under 25 and have no responsiblities.</p>
