    <strong>Peer Pressure Is Bad... Unless It's For The Vaccine!!!</strong>
    <p><p>My body, my choice... except no, fuck you, take this experimental, untested drug, rational thought and long term effects be damned! If you don't take it you're selfish! Do it for the grandma! I'm scared I've made the wrong choice because I have a brain made out of porridge and I want you to dive off the fucking cliff edge with me! ME ME FUCKING ME! wE aRe aLL iN tHiS tOgEtHeR!</p>
<p>You fucking narcissistic hypocrites ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Take away the veneer of the pandemic and really take a look at yourselves. Just imagine for a fucking second that there isn't some super scary maymay virus out there lazily beelining towards your grandmother like the world's shittest heat-seaking missile and put some fucking thought into the things you're doing and saying, into what you're allowing the government to do to you and the people you care about.</p>
<p>The petty power and virtue-signalling points you obtain from fanatically following the arbitrary rules and restrictions aren't worth this shit. You have NO IDEA how fucking bad things really are. If "the pandemic" is the worst of your worries then you must be very blissful because you're fucking pig-ignorant to the suffering of those around you and the precipice looming over a dystopian police state we find ourselves dangling from.</p>
<p>To paraphrase another post I've seen on here: right now you're the weird creepy guy aggressively badgering a girl into drinking with them at the bar; but you're a gooch-hair away from being the sort of charming gentleman who plops roofies into girls' unattended drinks. And before you splutter out some sort of outraged, blustering "Well I never!" protest: I HAVE FUCKING SEEN COMMENTS SAYING THIS SHIT SHOULD BE FORCED ON US.</p>
<p>If you find that offensive or, say, VERY FUCKING RAPEY (because, you know, it is), take a look at the company around you. There might be one or two loons on our side who think the Earth is flat or some shit (not that I've seen anyone say that, mind you) but I'd take them any day over the lip-licking perverts and psychopaths you have populating your side.</p></p>

        <p>Keep in mind that social media is rife with people either paid to say force the vaccine on others or they are just stupid. You should find a number of people in the real world who are totally against forced vaccinations from all walks of life.</p>
