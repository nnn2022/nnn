    <strong>Extremely depressing thought I just had about UK lockdown...</strong>
    <p><p>Pure conjecture of course, reassurance and counter-argument definitely welcome!</p>
<p>We’re seeing calls for the police in the UK to have police to have wider reaching powers to enforce lockdown compliance this third time around. I’ve seen a few videos of them on here really throwing their weight around, particularly in London. </p>
<p>One of the reasons that we’ve been able to laugh at the lockdown restrictions and keep ourselves sane has been to recognise that these restrictions are essentially unenforceable. I’m worried that this might be about to change. </p>
<p>If they want to police Lockdown 3 and any future restrictions effectively, they need more manpower. They can recruit easily because there are so many people out of work.</p>
<p>The thing is, there are many who have been put out of work and will be extremely pissed off in the genuine belief that the crisis has carried on for so long due to people not wearing masks and social distancing and that this, rather than government ineptitude or tyranny, is what cost them their jobs. </p>
<p>These new cops are going to be extra zealous in their work because they have a serious axe to grind. They won’t give a beggar for privacy, decency, tact, poise, nuance or reason. They will be ruthless and relentlessly officious and motivated. They will do so with the genuine conviction that they are serving and protecting.</p></p>

<p>They need a <em>lot</em> more manpower. Currently you can drive halfway across the country and not see a single police car.</p>
<p>&rt;They can recruit easily because there are so many people out of work</p>
<p>They don't have the money or the resources. They've been slashing police budgets for years and all the local cop-shops are shut.</p>
<p>Unless you're literally in Trafalgar Square or the opening to King's Cross Station, UK police aren't a factor in anyone's lockdown response.</p>

        <p>More than welcome! I go around a lot of the places the military likes to source their 'thugs' (i.e. badly let-down young men they can easily brutalise), and police are <em>hated</em> there. The only people they could recruit are Captain Carpal Tunnel and Bucks Fizz Brenda, who haven't been outside their house since March or in a fight since 1969.</p>
