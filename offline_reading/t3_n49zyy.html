    <p><p>I've seen a lot of things talking about states opening up. Well, my state has lifted some restrictions, but I wanted to shed light on what a lot of us college students are STILL going through right now.</p>
<p><strong>A Day in My Life</strong></p>
<p>Every day, I wake up, get out of bed, and get ready for my day. Usually that consists of sitting at my desk for several hours looking at a screen listening to my professor talk on Zoom, but a lot of my professors have actually given up on teaching on Zoom so they just upload pre-recorded lectures for me to watch like videos in my free time. </p>
<p>During quarantine, I've had one too many mental breakdowns over the fact that my entire world exists within the 4 walls of my room. I eat, sleep, and study in my bedroom now. To cope with this, I've taken up running. So most days before I sit at my desk for the entire day, I go on a run for as long as I can outside while listening to a podcast. This is one of the only things that makes me happy anymore, because it makes me feel free to look at the sky and not wear a mask.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time trying to distract myself from my actual life. I like to stay busy running errands for my family when I can, and I do a lot of chores and housework to keep myself busy. But when I don't have much to do, I find myself utterly depressed and hopeless.</p>
<p><strong>Before COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>I used to live in a sorority at my college campus. I was an officer for my house, and I had a great friend group. When COVID-19 hit, I moved back in with my family because my sorority closed, and I've been at home with my parents since. I love my family and am really happy I got to spend extra time with them, but I miss being around people my own age. Since my family lives in a really small town in a most retiree neigborhood, there's nobody my own age here, and I don't know anyone since I didn't grow up here. </p>
<p>Since I could no longer see my friends, and a lot of them also moved back to their homes in different states, we all eventually fell out of touch with nothing to talk about. Now I don't really have any friends, and I get lonely very often.</p>
<p><strong>During COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>My college sent out an email last year on March 13, 2020 telling us that class was cancelled and we'd be taking our finals online. When I moved home, I had to stop being a member of my sorority since they were still charging rent money and I couldn't afford to keep paying for something I wasn't actually getting.</p>
<p>My university said we'd be back for fall, so I got an apartment to start leasing in the fall. When fall came, I moved all my stuff into the apartment, only to realize that the "hybrid" model my university said we'd have for classes was 5% in-person, 95% online. All my classes ended up being online, so I packed up my stuff again and moved home, terminating my lease so I didn't waste money on rent for a campus that was still closed.</p>
<p>I'm a senior, and this year I would have gotten to do clinical observation hours for my major department. Instead I didn't get to do that at all, and I had to pay for a service to watch clinical videos online instead.</p>
<p>My graduation ceremony was cancelled, and the university's replacement for a commencement ceremony was to pre-record a video for us to watch on graduation day.</p>
<p><strong>Now</strong></p>
<p>I know this is a lot of superficial stuff. My dad has stage 4 cancer, and honestly that's something that keeps me sane because it puts all this into perspective for me. It reminds me that having friends, getting to be on campus, and having an in-person graduation is not the end-all-be-all of life. I'll get over all these disappointments, and move on. </p>
<p>But my point in making this post is to say that when I hear that things are "opening back up" I can't help but feel left behind. Do people actually forget that most of us college students are still in Zoom limbo, stuck with no social interactions, paying tuition for classes we aren't allowed to attend?</p>
<p>At first I thought lockdowns and masks were a good idea. Stop the spread, and all that. But I'm just going to be honest and say that I literally do not care at all about the old people that could die from this virus if we go back in-person. I'm 22 years old and I've been in quarantine since I was 20 years old. I really just want to live my life, and I'm sick of spending my 20's being in this 4x4 watching the seasons go by.</p></p>

        <p>Hey, your feelings are completely valid and I know where you are coming from. I am a second year (going into third year) university student in Ontario. I feel like this entire Covid debacle has put my life on pause. I want to progress my university career, get internships, go to festivals/concerts, meet new people and just enjoy life. You aren’t alone in this and feel free to DM me in case you want to talk more about this.</p>

        <p>I go to Carleton University. I got accepted to University of Leeds for exchange next year. I’m also concerned about vaccine mandates for university students. I don’t want to take it and if that happens, I’m going to try to pursue an exemption of any kind.</p>

        <p>There’s gotta be some kind of exemption. But I also know it’s just a matter of time before the universities here demand the vaccines or kick you out with no debate. It’s so hard watching all the friends I once had anxiously waiting for the magical vaccine to return them to normal. Even harder knowing it could fuck them up permanently or kill them.</p>

<p>But even if that proves to be true, they’ll prolly still get told to “take the vaccine and stfu, being infertile is better than getting COVID!”</p>

        <p>No stop saying shit like that. Stop making out it is a foregone conclusion. That’s what they want you to think. You are helping them spread their propaganda.</p>
<p>So far every court case about exclusion because of not being jabbed is paid in full out of court because they don’t have a leg to stand on.</p>
<p>They are hoping that by bombarding you with headlines about this company and that university that you will just give in and not actually look into it. </p>
<p>The person above has the right attitude. We must do whatever we can to find a way round and fight for exemptions. I will never give in.</p>

        <p>Yes you can fight it. With the courts closed how are they going to exclude you? Don’t mention anything about jabs and just go. Fake a jab certificate if you have to (although I suggest we only do this once the war is definitely lost otherwise we are just enabling this bullshit).

        <p>Canadian courts are all closed though. They even closed down zoom court meetings. </p>
<p>One of the best arguments in court right now is for the government to prove that covid exists, and is a threat, and that all the measures are beneficial. They can’t. You’d win. So what are the courts doing? They’re banning that argument from being made (see pastor Coates in Alberta). </p>
<p>There are so many high profile lawsuits being filed against the government, and the courts are all being closed in order to ignore them.</p>

        <p>In order to prevent it from getting to that point we need people to educate themselves and become comfortable with the social repercussions that comes with speaking out against such unjust mandates. If the discussion was open from the start and we weighed the risk analysis of covid vs the short &amp; long term risk of the vaccine in a younger population, then perhaps a mandate to impose experimental mRNA injections on us would have more ground. As it is, there has been absolutely no discussion allowed on the risks, and any attempt to express concern has been met with censorship. Up to this point we have gone down a path that is antithetical to the scientific process, and thus no university has the moral right to enforce these vaccines and restrict someone from getting an education in the country they live in.  - From a BC university</p>

        <p>Sources about the risks?</p>
<p>New study shows that much of the detrimental effects of covid could potentially be linked to the spike protein rather than the virus. The same spike protein that vaccines instruct your body to produce in order to form antibodies to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.salk.edu/news-release/the-novel-coronavirus-spike-protein-plays-additional-key-role-in-illness/">https://www.salk.edu/news-release/the-novel-coronavirus-spike-protein-plays-additional-key-role-in-illness/</a></p>

<p>Dr. Geert Vaden Bossche. A career vaccinologist is warning about the dangers of mass vaccination in promoting the adaptive pathways for viruses to mutate and lead to more deadly variants. We are injecting people with a vaccine which (at least initially) produces sub-optimal antibodies, preventing the individuals own antibodies from attaching to the antigens of the virus. In the event of this person coming into contact with covid, and transmitting it to another person, that virus has now had contact with similar sub-optimal antibodies and any adaptation the virus can make to bypass the immune system is inevitable if this process cycles through the population. It's similar to the danger of a bacteria strain only partly being subjected to an antibiotic. The bacteria that survived were already naturally hardy, and now they have the experience of being subject to the antibiotic and can adapt its genetical makeup around the potential for future exposure (antibiotic resistance)</p>

<p>A recent Tel Aviv study has found similar results:</p>

<p>Autoimmune dependent enhancement (ADE). This phenomenon is what caused every past mRNA vaccine to fail. All animals died during the trials, not from the vaccine but upon being exposed to the "wild" virus the immune system would go into overdrive. There are many sources online that highlight this. It is a hypothetical situation by nature, as nothing of this sort has ever been tested. But there is the untested potential for a future variant to interact with the current vaccine-mediated immunological response in a way that promotes ADE.</p>

        <p>That could take years. It might never happen for all we know. If the past year has shown anything, it’s that Canadians are pushovers. In the meantime they’d still force vaccinations. I have absolutely no idea where to go from here. It’s safe to say I’m not going back to university right now.</p>

        <p>Hey, you're not alone. I'm 23 and in university, I knew that this storm was coming in December of 2019 but I couldn't have imagined how much things would change. During quarantine my uncle (who is like a father to me) was diagnosed with leukemia, my great grandfather passed away (from falling out of bed) and even my dog of 14 years died. </p>

        <p>you’re a socialite and not being social is tough. natural. idk where you live, but maybe consider moving to a more free area when you can. </p>
<p>sorry to hear about your dad. despite that situation, you have every right to mourn the loss of important, formative rites of passage and rituals. </p>
<p>you’ll look back on this and vow to help ensure it never happens again.</p>
<p>as for college, you’re realizing it’s only real value for non STEM students is the social aspect. it’s an overinflated scam. that’s been exposed recently. </p>

        <p>Then when you add on the fact that you are ostracized by pretty much anyone in their 20’s for holding such “harmful beliefs” it makes for a very lonely life. I feel you. I’m a first generation college student and I have dreamed of graduating my whole life. I get to graduate on a screen. My school <em>raised</em> tuition costs this year. I haven’t made a new friend in over a year. I’m so fucking sad dude. Being as I’m near Portland there’s very little hope for me any time soon too. </p>
<p>I’m so sorry for what’s happened to you. It’s heartbreaking how much has been lost in this time void and it’s so out of our hands. Sending love and solidarity.</p>

        <p>You're not alone. My school did the same exact thing.
They made it seem like they were doing hybrid learning and only had like three classes in person. They still charged lab fees even though we were told to buy our own supplies. </p>
<p>Do you feel like teachers are giving more assignments than previous semesters? I do homework for 12 hours a day. I've always been a full time student and it was never this bad. </p>
<p>On top of this, my teachers are very negligent towards their due dates. The syllabi are constantly changing last minute and the dates are often incorrect. Of course, I can't contact anyone to hold the teacher responsible for their mistakes, but if I miss a due date I am the one who's penalized. So I end up doing the assignment that's due this Friday even though the teacher meant for it to be due next Friday. </p>
<p>Some teachers are trying to counter cheating by making tests extremely short. I want to push myself, but 30 mins for 30 questions gives me no time to skip a question and go back. </p>
<p>My social skills are also being destroyed by this. It's extremely difficult to make new friends when you have no way of starting conversations outside of a classroom setting. </p>
<p>I really hope there's a light at the end of this tunnel. There are so many ambitious students who are just going through the motions. I truly hope that this situation changes for you and I admire your ability to run every day!</p>

        <p>Wow with those professors just uploading things? No discussion, no conversation not even on Zoom, I guess one could get a better education on Youtube, choosing relevant videos and it's FREE. I wonder if they realize they are making themselves redundant? I would have lost it if my college years are like how young people are going through. What gets me is people your age are very low risk due to Covid, so having all the universities closed down makes no sense. :( Yeah this was supposed to be a great time of your life too. I hope you can live your life soon. Some states people are living normal lives, I guess you are graduating soon but for those who aren't maybe they can consider transferring to a college that is open.</p>

        <p>I’m not in college yet, but my high school did have online learning for a while. I don’t think they realize how bad online learning really is. It made me miserable. I’m sort of an introverted person, but even after two weeks, I was done. I hated it. I know lots of my classmates started to hate it too. Couldn’t pay attention to the meetings because they were boring as all get out. The assignments felt pointless. It felt like my work wasn’t being valued. The school system is destroying the lives of children, high schoolers, and college goers. It’s not even enough to say that I’m disappointed with the way schools have handled the situation. And now they are requiring a useless vaccine to go to college even though you are a perfectly healthy kid with no underlying conditions or allergies. Also, sorry to hear about your dad. My grandma passed away due to cancer recently, so I know the struggle. You are NOT alone. Please do not feel like you are the only one facing these problems. You are not. There are THOUSANDS of people dealing with the same things you are and have the same feelings you do. If you need anything, feel free to message me. I know it’s hard, but just try to keep your head up. Take up a new hobby or something. Find something that makes you happy and forget about the bad things in life.</p>

        <p>First, snap out of it. <strong>You</strong> are in control of yourself. Surely there is an area that is not covid-insane within reasonable driving distance. Go there to a night club. Start with the basics. The old-fashioned way. It works!</p>
<p>Secondly, write these thoughts down. To make sure you never forget them. And re-read them every election year. And make sure you keep a list of the guilty people. And re-read the list every time you vote. For the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Thirdly, make a list of people at fault who are not politicians nor celebrities - but people in your life. Then cut them off from your life. Forever. You don't need lockdownist toxicity in your life.</p>
<p>&rt; At first I thought lockdowns and masks were a good idea. Stop the  spread, and all that. But I'm just going to be honest and say that I  literally do not care at all about the old people that could die from  this virus if we go back in-person. I'm 22 years old and I've been in  quarantine since I was 20 years old. I really just want to live my life,  and I'm sick of spending my 20's being in this 4x4 watching the seasons  go by. </p>
<p>I read this to my 79-yo dad. His reaction? "What took her so long?!"</p>
<p>You've been through the trauma of a totalitarian regime. Draw the necessary wisdom from it to make sure it never happens to you again.</p>

        <p>I feel this deep in my soul. I've had to quarantine with my parents for the past year because they were higher risk for the virus and deeply terrified. I was just starting to get on my feet right before the virus hit and I lost a year of my life instead. Luckily I was able to get out some, but I've spent most of the past year alone and now that things are getting back to normal I just feel socially stunted now. Especially with most of my peers living normally the whole time.</p>

        <p>I feel really sad for the youth. My oldest niece did her diligence, kicked ass on her SATs, shopped around for a college that suited her needs, had an apartment picked out, and was set to move in for her freshman year - all right before Covid hit. Now she's living at home, zooming all of her classes while still getting charged the same tuition, and missing out on her first true taste of freedom. Some of my fondest memories are from my college years and it's sad to think she's been robbed of a period of her life she can never get back.</p>

        <p>Feel your pain man. I am sort of stuck in a similar situation of limbo and growing despondency. Everything you are saying is completely fair and anyone who says otherwise is too immature to confront the reality in front of them.</p>
<p>I am absolutely livid at this point. As to your last point, it really seems many older people are not afraid of the virus and totally agree with you! The people forcing this on us are not the elderly.</p>

        <p>I feel for you, as young person in the military currently, dealing with the unlawful restrictions is wasting the best years if my life. I encourage you to start BREAKING THE RULES!!! Covid restrictions are not as strictly enforced as you think they are because the silent majority of people are just as sick of it as we are. Even I’m states that are “shutdown”</p>

        <p>Thanks for the read. I'm a 20-something University student as well, and reading this was super comforting, I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. Your story was also super humbling, and made me re-evaluate some of the nasty parts of my life.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear about your Dad, I hope he recovers. Sending good vibes.</p>

        <p>I'm glad I'm not alone with these same feelings. Its finals week for me right now and I am graduating community college next week. These past two semesters have been so difficult for me since we've been completely online ( but the universities have all been in person so I am confused ). Last semester they didn't offer any traditional zoom classes where we all met online, but we just took the class at our own pace, which was awful. My teachers pretty much gave up on us and I nearly failed out. This semester has been much easier since we are actually having zoom meetings, but it still isn't the same. At least my grades are better now I guess. I was so close to not being able to graduate and transfer to a 4-year. </p>
<p>My friends are all doomers and we haven't seen each other since January, but they are very inconsistent with their logic. We were able to get together for their birthdays in September, but when it came to my birthday a few months ago, they couldn't be bothered to hang out because they were "waiting for the vaccine". They claim that we can all get together again once we are all vaccinated ( I am the only unvaccinated one and they don't know that ) but we still haven't gotten together. I've pretty much given up on them and now I don't really have any friends. I am depressed and lonely. This is now how I planned to spend my early 20s, but I am trying to fight back.</p>
