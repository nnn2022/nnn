        <p>The same can be said for any human, but chances are fairly slim for 99.97% of the population. Point is, we all need to go to work to make money to live, and we can't just not live our lives. The risks need to be weighed up. Never enjoy your life again and live like a prisoner, or deal with a bit of a cold, seems like an easy choice to me</p>

        <p>Please understand there is a huge difference between getting wet and getting covid. The mortality rate is low for now but if hospitals continue to fill up then the mortality is going to go up since we will be unable to treat people effectively. Also, there is some new research that getting covid and living can mess up your lungs worse than being a hardcore smoker. </p>
<p>At the end of the day please wear a mask in public, and get a negative test before going to large gatherings.</p>

        <p>Mortality as a whole may not have gone up yet but if we release all restrictions and the hospitals filled up like they did in Italy we would see large increases in deaths. California is starting to have issues with full hospitals. </p>
<p>Also in the last 7 days 1,596,830 people got covid, and 23,287 people died of covid. During the 2019-2020 flu season about 1,773,585 got the flew in an average week. In the same weekly average about 1,623 people died of the flu. </p>
<p>Using this math the flu at its worst has a mortality of 0.0915% and covid has a mortality of 1.46%. </p>
<p>We are getting 100,000’s of new covid cases a day, which translates to 1,000’s of deaths a day. </p>
<p>I understand frustrations, and I think that governments around the world should be doing more to help their people at a time like this. But, we can’t ignore how many people are dying of covid. Especially when you compare to countries like New Zealand and Australia whose case counts are barely able to get to double digits.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the kind words, but we are both gonna get all kinds of downvotes.  Also,the people of this sub are not morons, just misinformed.  So please do not use any name calling.  </p>
<p>When comparing the dangers and downsides of Covid with the lockdown it can be hard to weigh them equally.  It is really easy to see and quantify the downsides of a lockdown (limited gatherings, the effect on the economy, etc...), but it can be really hard to see the dangers of Covid.  Covid is much harder to rationalize because it feels very removed for some people.  There is also a lot of old information and misinformation regarding Covid, which only adds to the confusion.</p>

        <p>Let me guess, you just looked these up for the first time.</p>
<p>You link to 3 'news' articles, which is <strong>not evidence</strong>. Only two refer to actual studies/research and your fourth link <em>is the research being discussed by your second link</em>. <strong>Let's take a look:</strong></p>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">first</a> links to <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2020.0376">this research</a> - which describes a <em>hypothetical model</em> using <em>assumptions</em>, also admitting there is a "<strong>lack of experimental population-based data on facemask use</strong>", which at the time (June '20) was true. Since then the <strong>ONLY</strong> real world randomized controlled trial ever conducted - the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33205991/">DANMASK study</a> - was published, showing that <strong>masks do not protect the wearer</strong>. From your buried link: "...direct evidence of the efficacy of mask use is supportive, but <strong>inconclusive</strong>." The only real <em>supportive evidence</em> in that research being for <strong>hand washing</strong>. "Surgical masks are generally more protective than cloth masks"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118">Another review</a>, degrees of links buried - suggests we focus on having <em>the sick</em> wear masks. Quote: "<strong>None of the studies looked specifically at cloth masks</strong>." +  “there was <strong>insufficient evidence</strong> to provide a recommendation on the use of facial barriers <strong><em>without other measures</em></strong>.”  While it suggests there <strong>could</strong> be <strong>possible</strong> (but <strong>unknown</strong>) "<em>potential</em> for transmission from asymptomatic individuals," an <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695">actual study</a> of 10 million people (!) in Wuhan showed <strong>ZERO ASYMPTOMATIC SPREAD</strong>.</p>
<p>So we might ask, <strong>WHY are asymptomatic people wearing masks</strong>? That's MY main idea.</p>
<p>Another <strong>JUICY</strong> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jebm.12381">buried research article</a> <em>you</em> link to: "There were <strong>no statistically significant differences in preventing</strong> laboratory‐confirmed <strong>influenza</strong>,  laboratory‐confirmed <strong>respiratory viral infections</strong>, laboratory‐confirmed <strong>respiratory infection</strong> and <strong>influenza-like illness</strong> using <strong>N95 respirators and surgical masks.</strong>" No comment!</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/27/3/taaa056/5822103">buried research article</a>: "<strong>community use of masks has been discouraged</strong> by the World Health Organization (WHO)" "Messaging by WHO and by many countries suggests that <strong>mask use in the community has no benefit</strong>, and should <strong>only be used by sick patients</strong>" "<strong>cloth masks are not as well studied</strong> as disposable masks" "<strong>filtration of the cloth mask was very poor</strong> compared to the surgical mask" Cites another <em>model</em> using <em>assumptions</em> YAWN.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/new-study-highlights-new-evidence-that-masks-prevent-coronavirus-spread/">second</a>, which links to <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/36/eabd3083">this study</a>, does suggest that cloth masks reduce droplet emission, which may help with influenza transmission - however the problem is that other research indicates that <strong>coronavirus spreads via aerosol</strong>, which is distinct from droplets.  "[It is] <strong>unfeasible to directly measure the size of small (aerosol) droplets in our setup</strong>." It also shows that N95 masks &amp; poly-blend masks are much more effective with droplets, but also more difficult to breathe while in use. Surgical masks were also more effective than cloth masks with droplets. However, <strong>not evidence for cloth masks preventing Covid-19 transmission</strong>.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-face-masks-what-you-need-to-know">third</a> is recommendations from John Hopkins <strong>without citations, research, or evidence</strong>. Disregarded.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/36/eabd3083/tab-pdf">fourth</a> is specifically <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/36/eabd3083">the study</a> linked to in your <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/new-study-highlights-new-evidence-that-masks-prevent-coronavirus-spread/">second article</a>. Ridiculous.</p>
<p>The <strong>imposition of mask mandates</strong>, which have generally high compliance, <a href="https://twitter.com/yinonw/status/1321177359601393664"><strong>DO NOT change the rate of covid cases</strong></a> whether the trend was up or down.</p>
<p>What is RARELY addressed, is how in practice everyone is reusing the same cloth masks for hours a day, touching their faces and masks repeatedly, negating the desired (yet <strong>unsupported</strong>) effect.</p>
<p>If anyone at all, <strong>ONLY SICK &amp; SYMPTOMATIC</strong> folks should be wearing a mask,  <strong><em>NOT THE WHOLE GODDAMN WORLD</em></strong>. Specifically a <strong>medical-grade NON-cloth mask</strong> at that!</p>

        <p>Holy fuck bud, that was hard to read. All the different formatting just felt like an actual schizo attack. Anyway, very minor counterpoint. </p>
<p>"Only the sick should wear (good) masks." I could agree with this, however, how do we track it? Police it? If your ONLY current symptom is, say, loss of your sense of taste, that still makes you a carrier of a virus which can kill someone else. </p>
<p>It would be very, very easy for you to walk in to a store while symptomatic, and nobody would even know. You'd be free to breath out droplets and aerosol all over the place. </p>
<p>The problem with 'only the sick' is that it relies on people being honest and honorable. People are not these things. If we had a society where people were actually personally responsible, as you all claim to be, it would be fine. But repeatedly members here have said "I don't care about your family" so why would they wear a mask even when symptomatic? They'd just pull the "Don't go outside your house" line. </p>
<p>Can you think of a way where we can guarantee all sick people are wearing a mask, and healthy people don't have to? Trust me, I'd love that. I'm asthmatic and have glasses, and live in a cold climate. Between my glasses fogging up whenever I enter a store, and my dislike of having a mask on for extended periods, I would love this solution. Please share it with me.</p>

        <p>1/2:</p>
<p>I would say that news articles can be good sources. Not everyone is science literate enough to read the papers the news is based on. The news site gets views and people get an easier to understand guide on masks.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">first link</a> did not include the article you say it did. Unless, that article is buried within another paper that is linked in my first article. Either way it is disingenuous for you to ignore all 16 links from the article just to find a part of one of the links that you think supports your view.

<p>Let's look at your <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2020.0376#d1e2513">first article</a> anyway. This article was interesting to read because it is similar to a Homework Project I did for one of my chemical engineering classes, but the model and math used in the article was much more advanced with more variables and controls. From what I can tell they used other peoples' data and research to estimate mask effectiveness's and then plugged those values into their code to find the percent mask use that would prevent a run-away infection. Overall I would say its good math and decent support for mask wearing, but you are right that nothing beats numbers from the real world. There are so many things that can effect viruses and their transmission that it would be impossible to build a perfect model, but you can get close enough for broad estimates. </p>
<p>Now I will take a look at your <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33205991/">DANMASK study</a>. You completely ignore the section where they discuss the limitations of the study. The study even said that they were unable to test if an infected person wearing a mask protects others from their Covid. This is a way that masks reduce the spread and is listed in the Background of the DANMASK Study. Please understand that only N95 grade masks protect the user, all other mask types protect others from the user. You or I could easily have Covid and be asymptomatic. This means we should wear a mask to prevent spread of Covid from us to others. This makes sense when you think about the original function of the surgical masks and the N95 masks. N95 is worn when doctors or nurses are working with extremely ill patients, the surgical masks were worn by doctors and nurses who were preforming surgeries. If the doctors breath or sneeze into a patient they could create an internal infection that kills them. So the surgical masks were made to protect the insides of surgical patients from the germs in doctors' and nurses' breath. Works the same way with normal people and not giving each other Covid.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118">third article</a> is from December 5th of 2020, shortly after the severity of Covid became obvious. As a result, there were very few other studies to pull research from. I am not that surprised that no other modern studies available looked at cloth masks. Since December 5th we have had an influx of research on masks and almost all of it suggests what I have been saying N95 to protect the wearer, surgical to protect others. Also, your article directly quotes against what you said multiple times: "we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing" "Simple cloth masks present a pragmatic solution for use by the public. This has been supported by most health bodies." "Cloth-masked subjects expelled an average of 19 contaminants per 5 cubic feet; 63% were less than 4 μm in diameter. So overall, over 99% of contaminants were filtered." I could go on, but this is already getting very long as is. In the future please read the whole article instead of trying to make broad conclusions from the background section of a research paper. The background section of research paper are just a discussion of previous research that has been done so the reader can have a better understanding of the research that was actually done within the main body of the paper.</p>
<p>Your <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4695">next article</a> comes from December 1, 2020, a time when we knew very little about Covid. And a quote from later in the paper is: "The researchers said that their findings did not show that the virus couldn’t be passed on by asymptomatic carriers, and they didn’t suggest that their findings were generalisable." And: "They said that strict measures—such as mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing, and lockdown—were successful in reducing the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and that asymptomatic people in Wuhan may have low viral loads. This means that the finding cannot be applied to countries where outbreaks have not been successfully brought under control." It seems like you are trying to cherry-pick what part of an article without regarding the works as a whole. There are plenty of papers that suggest asymptomatic spread is a big part of the virus.</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jebm.12381">Next Article</a> is from March of 2020 (much better but our knowledge of masks and Covid has grown). There are some issues discussed here: the reason for similar effects could be due to low mask compliance, lots of opportunity for bias, not much data on community spread, and publication bias due to an insufficient number of randomized controlled trials. Think about it in most engineering and medical studies the p-value used in statistical analysis is usually 0.05. The p-value is the chance that you got your results by pure random chance. In the case of our articles that means that the authors accept a 1/20 chance that they reached the wrong conclusion. We have now looked at 17 articles/papers, all of which point to masks being effective accept 1. I am inclined to beleive that this article is the closest we will get to the 1/20, but I will include a final count when I am done looking at your articles. And, a fun quote from the article "However, it should be noted that the surgical masks are primarily designed to protect the environment from the wearer, whereas the respirators are supposed to protect the wearer from the environment"</p>

        <p>2/2:</p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/27/3/taaa056/5822103">Another one</a>, Published in April of 2020 the start of a lot of the modern research. Your first two quotes are from the background of the article. These were the authors setting up the background for why they are doing their study not the results of the study. This study was at the beginning of the pandemic, not many people used cloth masks yet so why would there be a large amount of research on them? A few sentences down from your quote is this one: "found respirators performed best, followed by surgical masks and lastly cloth masks—<strong>however, cloth masks did provide some protection</strong>" It also says that cloth masks may not be suitable for health care workers they may be useful for community use. As for the poor filtration, The sentence after the one you quoted: "This finding may be due to poor fabric, inadequate design or washing and <strong>may not be generalizable to all home-made masks</strong>." This paper goes on to talk about what fabrics make the best DIY mask and how to make sure they are protective. New research and guidelines have also been made after this paper. The general consensus is that DIY masks should use at least 3 layers of cotton fabric and fit/mold to the face well in order to be adequate. Now enforcing use of only properly made DIY masks would be nearly impossible so it is up to the individual to use and maintain proper masks (this is why I use disposable masks. I just cannot find a DIY one that fits my face well and I know that what I'm using has 3 layers including a water resistant one.)</p>
<p>On to <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/new-study-highlights-new-evidence-that-masks-prevent-coronavirus-spread/">my second article</a> (Holy cow is this long, I am so sorry) This one only has 4 links: <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/heres-how-wearing-a-cloth-mask-helps-fight-the-spread-of-coronavirus/">1</a>, <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/36/eabd3083">2</a>, <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/2102-raed-dweik?_ga=2.125766026.1426292663.1610904778-2117384897.1610904778">3</a>, <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/covid-19-understanding-quarantine-isolation-and-social-distancing-in-a-pandemic/">4</a>. 1 is all about how homemade masks may not protect you but they do protect others from you. Including that homemade masks can capture proteins that are smaller than Covid. Number 2 here is the same as the fourth of my original set. (I just think this study is cool because it shows a more in depth look at what kind of masks are best) Every mask type tested in this experiment cut the number of visible droplets by 1/2 (with the exception of the bandana and neck gaiter. Most masks reduced droplets by 1/5 or more. This shows that the masks are effective, just because they aren't able to look at droplets less than 0.5 micrometers. To put that number into context their setup could see particles that are 100 times smaller than the human hair. When it comes to these droplets you also have to consider viral load; bigger droplets will have more virus. Thus, bigger droplets are more of a problem for our immune system to fight off. The incredibly small amount of virus in the droplets too small to measure might not be enough to infect someone without an extremely long exposure time. Regardless reducing the amount of water droplets reduces Covid transmission. Covid is spread through these water droplets, you don't just breath out pure Covid Virus. Covid needs to hitch a ride on the water droplets. There is also no mention of any of the masks making it harder to breath. The size of CO2, O2, and N2 (the components most applicable to breathing) are all about 0.3 nm. This means the components of air are 1000 times smaller than the smallest water droplet that could be detected by the test. If the masks did make it harder to breath (Which they don't) then they would have to effectively block the droplets that contain Covid as well since these droplets are much larger than the components that make up our breath. The other two links are the credentials of a doctor who was quoted and some guidelines on how to maintain healthy and safe habits while quarantining (this assumes you are already sick). I would assume we have differences of opinion on those two links.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-face-masks-what-you-need-to-know">Last of my sources</a>, this one is more of a collection of other articles written by a Doctor who makes their living researching infectious Diseases. She is definitely an expert in her field. However, there are no links to outside publications or official research.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/yinonw/status/1321177387397099520">Twitter thread</a> you shared is not the best data and misrepresents what might actually be happening. Firstly, Yinon Weiss is not a doctor, healthcare expert, Biological Engineer, or Nurse. He is a business man and has no fundamental knowledge of pandemics or diseases. Also, most mask mandates have been reactive instead of proactive. As a result, masks were mandated after the problem was discovered. It would be like trying to buckle your seatbelt while in the middle of a car crash. It might help but it won't prevent the crash. In order to fully prevent most Covid spread we would need 80% of the population to wear a proper mask in public. Every neck gaiter, improperly fitted mask, and mask worn below the nose would not count. Thus, people can still spread the virus because these mask mandates rarely enforce proper masks and proper mask wearing. Also, pandemic fatigue has caused plenty of people to start disregarding rules and lowering compliance. Does Yinon Weiss take any of this into consideration the way a professional researcher would? No, he just shows graphs with no explanation other than "masks don't work" when there is plenty of evidence that proves correct usage of masks helps slow the spread immensely. Notice how Yinon does not mention New Zealand or Australia. Both countries had mask mandates and lockdowns, and both are currently more or less covid free. If either country has new cases in the double digits for a day it is high and abnormal. You cannot pick and choose which countries to look at and say it proves your point, you have to look at everything.</p>
<p>The biggest dangers of Covid is that people can spread it while asymptomatic. So, having everyone wear a mask to prevent them from unknowingly spreading Covid is the best defense until we get 70%-80% of the population vaccinated. Here are three of the first results from google scholar with research on asymptomatic transmission of the virus: <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2762028">1</a>, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2009758">2</a>, <a href="https://thorax.bmj.com/content/75/8/693.full">3</a></p>
<p>TLDR: most of the sources you listed as proof that masks do not work were misrepresenting the paper the quote was taken from. In the 34 links I discussed only two supported your view and one of them was just a twitter thread from a business man. When quoting a research paper or scientific article please read and understand the whole thing instead of stopping when you think you have a catchy quote.</p>

        <p>Thanks, my response did get out of hand length wise.  I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything.  I want to thank you for not imediatly cussing me out like some people on this sub.  It might be pointless but I want to have a discussion.  Lockdowns have downsides and how and where to lockdown can be discussed.  However, masks help and do not really negatively impact people.</p>
<p>When discussing masks it is important to remember a few things:  Science can change and admit that it was wrong.  When we didn't know much about Covid or global mask supplies it made sense to say do not wear a mask.  However, now that more research on how Covid spreads and a huge increase in mask production: it is clear that masks help prevent the spread of the virus, and it is possible for everyone to have a mask supply while also having a stockpile for doctors and nurses.  (supply wise I'm only talking about surgical style masks there are some issues with having enough N95s for doctors and nurses in some areas).  </p>
<p>Also, lockdowns may not be perfect but they can help reduce spread.  New Zealand and Australia are proof of that.  They both did lockdowns and mask mandates and have gone from spikes to almost nothing.</p>

        <p>It is not evidenced that masking everyone with cloth masks (the current status quo) helps prevent spread. And yes, I'm glad you acknowledge the downsides of lockdowns, which are devastating on people's lives in the long term. Lockdowns are inexcusable for the harm they cause.</p>
<p>Lockdowns in NZ/Aus: Ah, the refrain of the pro-lockdown crowd. There's a reason why I specify the inefficacy of lockdowns <em>after significant community spread</em>. New Zealand and Australia are island nations with the luxury of natural water borders and the ability to reliably lockdown to outsiders, unlike most landlocked nations with porous borders.</p>
<p>The downsides for NZ/Aus: highly draconian lockdowns that have <em>killed</em>. Their pursuit of zero covid is now their Achilles heel, as they can never open up or they will face endemic covid like the rest of the world. A perpetual catch-22. This does however, give them the luxury of waiting to implement the new mRNA vaccines (pfizer &amp; moderna) until further research is conducted on their safety.</p>
<p>Why don't you cite nations that implement draconian lockdowns but still fail to contain covid? Could it be because they are inconvenient to your pro-lockdown narrative? And how long do you want lockdowns? It's clear goal-post shifting from here to eternity.</p>
<p>Now if you compare states in the US or countries abroad that dont lock down to those that do, how they fare varies wildly and <em>does not depend on lockdown status</em>.</p>

        <p>Don't call people names, it is uncalled for.  It does nothing but try to belittle people who are not stupid.  There are lots of sources of misinformation about covid.  The economic issues brought on by the lockdown is also a much more "in your face" easy to see concern for some people.  </p>
<p>I am trying to make the case that both things are issues and governments should be doing more to help people fiscally during lockdowns.  That way people's financial needs are met and they are safe from covid.</p>

        <p>Right but we have laws about who can drive and how they can drive. The government employs police to enforce these rules. The government enforces safety regulations for car manufacturers. Driving is deadly so the government controls it to make it safer. </p>
<p>Why should covid be any different?  </p>
<p>Also: 38,000 deaths per year from cars that is 731 deaths per week (way lower than covid). Ball-parking mortality using 279,600,000 vehicles gives a driving mortality of 0.0136%. (This number is probably lower in reality. My math assumed each car only ever had one person in it so the actual number of total people traveling by car would really be higher, thus making mortality lower). </p>
<p>So driving is less dangerous than covid and is controlled by the government. As a result the government also has a responsibility to control the spread of covid.</p>

        <p>If you drive recklessly and kill someone you get put in jail.  If you have too many traffic violations you can get your license taken away.  The lockdown was only supposed to be a few months.  However, people didn't follow the rules so we ended up like this instead of ending up like New Zealand or Australia.  I would love to see my friends or parents just for the heck of it.  But, the way things are right now, if I visit someone and they get covid and die I would never be able to forgive myself.  That is why I always get tested before and after visiting someone outside of my circle of 5 friends.  It sucks but it keeps them safe and keeps my conscience clean.  </p>
<p>In all honesty I think we should have better widespread testing.  That way we don't have to lock down everyone only those who are positive.  Weekly widespread testing would have been a godsend a year ago.  US Senators and Representatives have been doing testing to avoid masks for the past year and have only cause 2 super spreader events.  If we did masks, widespread weekly testing, and vaccines as a country, we could beat covid in a matter of months.</p>

        <p>The fact that people can have it and not know makes it so much more dangerous.  If it was obvious who was infected, then the infected would isolate and we wouldn't have nearly as much spread as we do.</p>
<p>As of now a little over 2 Million people have died worldwide, even more people have been hospitalized.  And just because someone doesn't die from the virus doesn't mean they are out of the woods.  Many people who have recovered from Covid have significant lung and artery damage (Comparable to heavy smokers).  It is unknown how much of this damage will heal in the long term.  Why risk having long term lung and artery damage?</p>

        <p>We can't solve one problem by creating another.  The governments need to make sure that the needs of their people are being met in times of crisis.  The service industry is the sector of the economy that is being hit hard.  They need help and money to stay open.  Unemployment benefits need extended.  People who are struggling could use direct payments.  If the government stopped arguing long enough to actually help their people we wouldn't have these issues.  </p>
<p>If we go back and forth over killing people with a lockdown vs killing people by spreading the virus we are not finding a solution, we are arguing over who to kill.</p>

        <p>There are a couple ways to support these businesses even during lockdown.  I don't know how it is where you are from, but most restaurants are still open at half capacity.  It's not great, but they should be getting more help (money) from the government.  I order takeout as much as I used to eat out to make sure I continue to support these businesses.  Combine more federal aid with the 50% business and we should be able to keep people safe from the virus and the economic pitfalls of a shutdown.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to ensure businesses do not fail even during a shutdown.<br>
 There are many fewer ways to prevent the spread of the virus, especially with the new strains that spread more easily.</p>

        <p>We protect ourselves all the time for things that are rare.  I mean rabies is extremely rare disease but ever pet I'd required to have an annual rabies vaccine.  So while Spot:s chances of running into a wild animal with rabbies is extremely small, it's such a dangerous and easily spread disease that they require the vaccine.  </p>
<p>Beyond that the mortality rate is low but hospitalizations for the illness are pretty high as are chronic symptoms afterwards.  Its the same reason people are told to take precautions with any disease.  You don't risk eating raw chicken just because salmonella won't kill you, it'll still make you dangerously sick, they even do massive recalls when food posioning is a threat.  Driving is similar, millions of accidents happen every year but only a very small portion are fatal because we have tons and tons of safety measures now to reduce fatal accidents.</p>

        <p>And that is because it's true.  If we cannot treat people for the virus then they will die in higher numbers.  Number of physical beds, number of ventilators, and the number of doctors/nurses are all limited.  If we do not have enough of the first two it is easy to say the hospital is full.  However, if hospitals are short on staff then they have to hire new less-experienced staff, have longer hours that leave staff tired and burned out, or spread more patients among less caretakers reducing the amount of effective time each person gets with a doctor/nurse.</p>

If it is raining in California and Sunny in Florida that doesn't mean it can't rain in Florida.

        <p>&rt; At the end of the day please wear a mask in public, and get a negative test before going to large gatherings.</p>
<p>I won't. And I travel constantly, too. Guess you're stuck inside forever.</p>

        <p>Then You are constantly putting yourself and others at risk.  Please understand that wearing a mask does not protect you very well from others.  Wearing a mask protects others from you very well.  So everyone needs to wear one because it is impossible to know if you are contagious or not.  </p>
<p>Covid kills \~1.5% of people who get it in the United States.  If you spread it to 10 of your closest friends who then spread it to 10 of their closest friends then the odds are very high that 1-2 of the people you care about will die due to your negligence.  </p>
<p>Is there a reason you can't wear a mask?  Is there a reason you cannot meet up digitally?  Is there a reason yall can't get a negative test before meeting up?  Is there a reason you can't socially distance and meet outside?</p>
<p>I'm not saying you can't see anyone forever, I'm asking that people be smart and take precautions when visiting others.  2 Million people are dead, even more went through traumatic hospitalization.  Doctors and Scientists do not the full long term consequences of the virus's ability to damage the lungs and arteries.  I just want people to be safe, healthy, and not spread the virus to others.</p>

        <p>I saw that picture of the lungs earlier on reddit also. But it was misleading. The picture of covid lungs that are worse than a smoker's was during an active infection, not several months down the line. Just saying.</p>

        <p>You got me curious, so I did more research on the topic: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351">Mayo Clinic</a>, <a href="https://www.uchealth.com/en/media-room/covid-19/short-and-long-term-lung-damage-from-covid-19">UC Health</a>, and <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/what-coronavirus-does-to-the-lungs">John Hopkins</a>.</p>
<p>They all agree that short term lung damage occurs due to Covid.  As far as long term damage they all seem to say that lung damage can take a long time to heal.  The average seems to be a few months to a year to heal the lung damage.  Some people also have experience long term fatigue and joint pain even after their body fought off the virus.  The long term health effects of surviving the virus are not yet known.  But, combine our current knowledge of the long term effects with the \~1.5% chance of dying, and I will do what it takes to keep myself, my family, and my friends safe.</p>
