    <strong>Mask mandates are anti common sense, anti science and anti logic.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm going to try to stay level headed and not get angry for once, but still tell it how it is. I am not pro vax, nor am I anti vax per se. I will say I did not, and will not get the vaccine because the risk to my demographic is so incredibly low that someone like myself is actually taking a bigger risk getting vaccinated, than not getting vaccinated (especially considering that I already got the virus 5 months ago). For other people maybe this is not the case. </p>
<p>So I am not anti vax and I think anyone who is afraid of the virus should go get vaccinated, so I guess in that regard I am pro vax, but again, it is your choice. I just want to set that straight and not come off as anything that may dilute the point of this post. Anyway... </p>
<p>So it's been several months now in the US that the vaccine has been available to the general public. Anyone who is writhing in fear over the virus should fear no more right? No, this is a way of life to many people. Even after getting the vaccine, there are many people still fearful of the virus. But that fear is totally irrational and I have numbers to back it up:</p>
<p>Out of 75 million vaccinated individuals in the US, only 74 have died from covid after getting theirs shot(s). That's right your odds of dying from covid post vaccination are 1 in 1 million. </p>
<p>The fatality rate for healthy individuals with no comorbititys under age 60 is negligible. Lower than the flu even (will link a source if requested). </p>
<p>The vaccine has been available for the vulnerable population since at least February. </p>
<p>So anyone in at risk categories has had 3 months+ to get their vaccine.</p>
<p>Therefore most people in the "at risk" category have been moved into the "1 in one million chance of death from covid" category. </p>
<p>Everyone who is afraid of the virus, can get their shot, and eliminate the risk of dying from covid. 1 in 1 million are your chances of dying from covid post vaccine, let me reiterate. </p>
<p>You may die from other things post vaccine, such as a car accident, to which the odds of are 1 in 103. Or you may die in a lightning strike, which your odds are about 1 in 20,000, but your risk of dying from covid after getting vaccinated is still 1 in 1,000,000. </p>
<p>So what then are your odds of getting the virus from a non mask wearer, who happens to have an asymptomatic case of covid, who passes by you in the cereal aisle in walmart, and then dying of the virus?...</p>
<p>It's such a low risk that it literally can't even be quantified. (If I had to guess I'd say it's in the ballpark of 1 in 100 billion at least)</p>
<p>"BuT wHaT aBoUt ThE nEw VaRiAnTs?" </p>
<p>The one in one million statistic is for all variants. Also, even if 100% of the population got the vaccine, that isn't going to prevent new variants from spreading. Vaccines simply trigger an immune response so that your body can fight off viruses. People seem to act like vaccines work like hand sanitizer, purifying the blood of toxic covid. No. No matter how many vaccines are administered, the virus is already out there and it cannot be eliminated. And even if vaccines were the virus killers that the media would have you believe they are, they can not entirely eliminate covid. Animals such as cats and dogs can still get the virus. </p>
<p>So in short, the virus is here to stay. "Zero covid" is not an option. I think we should all just move on and pretend it doesn't exist, because most of us aren't afraid of the virus. To those of you who are afraid of the virus, you have a solution that can make all of your worries disappear, the vaccine. If you are still worried about the virus after getting the vaccine, you should reevaluate and readjust your risk tolerance, because your odds of dying from covid due to a 5 second interaction with an unmasked stranger is so low that it's a ridiculous thing to be worried about. If you know the risk is low, yet you still practice covid rituals anyway such as mask wearing, and surface sanitizing, as a political gesture, great, good for you. Keep owning those conservative non mask wearers! Show them how virtuously misinformed you are! Don't be surprised when nobody takes you seriously though. </p>
<p>All things considered, masks are totally unnecessary covid theater at this point. Mask mandates should not be in place anywhere period. Especially in the US. With vaccines practically eliminating all risks associated with covid, all arguments for masks are no longer relevant. If everybody has the choice to get a vaccine, no other covid measures are needed. I could see maybe having restrictions still in place for like the first month of the vaccine rollout, (just for arguments sake)but it's been several months now of it being available for everyone. It's over. Mask mandates at this stage are completely anti science in every way possible. </p>
<p>It is your duty as a citizen of this country to stand up for your freedoms. Whether you stand for liberty or science or both, we should all agree. No more top down government control over our lives, no more fear mongering, no more lockdowns, no more masks!</p></p>
