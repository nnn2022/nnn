        <p>Nitrates, GMO foods, it’s hard to find anything in the grocery store that does have nasty preservatives. Monsanto loves spraying our vegetables. </p>
<p>Fluoride in the water, among various heavy metals that are deemed “safe amounts” - I use an aquagear filter. Kinda expensive and they don’t have as long as a life they advertise but it’s good at what it does you taste the difference. </p>
<p>Air is fucked from pollution but even worse is all the EMF radiation we get. I’m not saying burn down the 5G towers but people don’t want to read and educate themselves. “The Invisible Rainbow” by Arthur Firstenburg will make you want to vomit. I’m not even half way done and it’s tripping me the fuck out.</p>

        <p>Love Camus, one of my favorite philosophers. He would have been outraged at what is going on today. Camus was firmly against any kind of exploitation, authoritarian control, State overreaching and centralization of power. He was considered an Existential Anarchist and would have been one of the leading voices against the control and abuse of power going on right now around the world.</p>

        <p>Literally no one wants COVID to continue except maybe the superrich who benefit from it. I am not superrich. At worst, masks don’t work as well as the CDC purports, but they certainly work better than no masks. That’s not arguable. If you really wanted COVID to end, you’d take any step to make it end.</p>

        <p>Congrats on the dumbest comment in the history of Reddit! The meaning of his statement is that government tyrants use the idea of “the welfare of the people” to trick the population into accepting policies that only serve the tyrants/government, but increase control over the citizens and therefore reduce freedom and the livelihoods of the citizens... all tyrants who’ve killed vast swaths of their populations have used this “idea”.  But sure, you must be very stable telling folks resisting psychopaths that are removing their opportunity to provide for their families to “kill themselves”.... Such a great person you are.  You’re a f*ckin Jackass!</p>

        <p>wow, lots to unpack here.  </p>
<p>so, let me get this straight- it's the <em>democrats</em> who downplayed the seriousness of the virus, leading to extended shutdowns.  also the <em>democrats</em> who blocked aid for small businesses and individuals during record-high unemployment.  also, guessing it was (mostly) the democrats who are violating mask rules en masse with religious gatherings and cult (ahem sorry I mean "political") rallies for the same person who downplayed the pandemic and <em>literally caught it himself</em>....</p>
<p>am I getting your drift?</p>

        <p>Democratic governors dramatically OVERplayed the seriousness of the virus while at the same time implementing draconian lockdowns and rules that forced millions of workers out of their usual shifts and permanently crippled and bankrupted tens of thousands of small to medium size businesses which made them dependent on government aide that never materialized because our Congress is literally useless. The Republicans blocked anything that the democrats wanted and people like Pelosi essentially held the nation hostage leading up to the election. It was the Democratic house that refused to pass any aide bill because they figured that if Americans were suffering more they would hate Trump more. </p>
<p>All the while you have people like Newsom ordering people to stay home, ordering mask mandates and he is out celebrating at a 3 Michelin Star restaurant without masks or social distancing while millions of his own residents are bankrupt from his edicts. </p>
<p>And the same is true in New York where Cuomo and DeBlasio have issued so many rules that New York as a city is now failing. The life blood of the cities, the cafes, bars, and restaurants are all gone and they aren't coming back. </p>
<p>And just excuse me for a fucking second... lets talk about church shall we? I can't go to my congregation because that would be a covid superspreader event and I'm putting everyones lives at risk... but I'm allowed to go to a big box store and a mall and mingle with thousands of other people... all strangers. Wal Mart and my local grocery store are safe but me standing in a pew once a week with the same 70 odd people I see every week is wildly dangerous. </p>
<p>And unpack this... </p>
<p>Trump rallies were dangerous. </p>
<p>BLM riots and protests were not... to the point that health officials in Democratic states even said that protesting was more important than COVID. </p>
<p>And then when Biden won people went into the streets en masse to celebrate shoulder to shoulder. Times Square was packed to the point that people on social media were comparing it to the WWII victory crowds but there was never any mention of danger or covid because in the Media's eyes anyone questioning the narrative is a dangerous moron who is probably a death-obsessed hick and anyone who voted for Biden is empathetic and caring and taking all the necessary precautions. </p>
<p>The sheer level of hysterical one-way bias among all of the major media outlets is astounding. </p>
<p>And this is all in the face of mounting evidence from the Danish mask study that wearing masks isn't effective. It's in the face of new studies showing that cloth masks not only DON'T prevent covid spread they actually increase the rate of lung infections. And this is in the face of research published in Nature showing that asymptomatic spread doesn't exist. A study of 10 million people found no evidence whatsoever of spread which is a sentiment the WHO was saying back in June which caused outrage among doomers. </p>
<p>And yet overwhelmingly Democratic governors ignore science, ignore new evidence and their health officials even admit on live TV that the restrictions aren't based on empirical evidence. They are acting merely so they can be seen taking action. </p>
<p>They found evidence that masks don't help... so they ordered mask mandates. </p>
<p>They found lockdowns increase suicides and economic devastation while not stopping the spread of covid. </p>
<p>They found that children are not vulnerable and schools are not the source of major infection outbreaks and yet they are ordered shut.</p>
<p>Democratic governors have overwhelmingly shown that they are interested in the the spectacle of health and not actual results. Their followers are afraid and WANT to remain afraid and they are playing into that.  </p>
<p>So... do you get <strong>ME</strong> sweetheart?</p>

        <p>&rt;It was the Democratic house that refused to pass any aide bill because they figured that if Americans were suffering more they would hate Trump more. </p>
<p>The house passed relief bills <em>several times</em> but were blocked by The Senate because of overt corporate pork-barrelling by the Republicans.  The Republicans could have passed a relief bill <em>without</em> corporate liability exemptions any time over the last 8 months that would have expanded the original CARES act provisions for unemployment and small businesses (ie restaurants)- the exact thing you're lamenting the demise of.  </p>
<p>&rt;The sheer level of hysterical one-way bias among all of the major media outlets is astounding. </p>
<p>I agree with you here, yet you're clearly subscribing to a single, partisan-driven narrative yourself.  </p>
<p>&rt;And yet overwhelmingly Democratic governors ignore science, ignore new evidence and their health officials even admit on live TV that the restrictions aren't based on empirical evidence. They are acting merely so they can be seen taking action. </p>
<p>none of your very selective and limited "sources" back this baseless claim.  </p>
<p>&rt;Democratic governors have overwhelmingly shown that they are interested in the the spectacle of health and not actual results. Their followers are afraid and WANT to remain afraid and they are playing into that. </p>
<p>Besides he point that this is another unfounded generalization, do you <em>really</em> think The Republicans give a fuck about anybody other than their corporate donors?  Really? </p>
<p>&rt;So... do you get ME sweetheart?</p>
<p>yes, I get that you're yet another victim of partisan brainwashing.</p>
