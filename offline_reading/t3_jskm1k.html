<title>With continuous articles and information like this coming out everyday, shouldn't we be noticing it in our actual daily lives? Am the only one that pretty much only hears about cases and hospitalizations from the news? Like does this really feel like a pandemic to you?</title>

        <p>Everybody that I actually talk to IN PERSON in my day to day life says the same thing: I don't know anybody that's caught coronavirus OR I do but it was literally asymptomatic or like having the flu. Like really? It's a "Pandemic" yet I've literally yet to meet anyone that's been harshly affected by it or knows anyone that has and it's been 8 MONTHS. </p>
<p>I brought this up before and people's explanation of this was "It's because people are under lockdown and quarantining so, of course, you won't hear about it" YET these are the people that also argue the cases are RISING because nobody is quarantining as they should. Doesn't that contradict itself?</p>

        <p>I work in medical and have to ask ~70 people a day if they’ve had these events occur in their lives. I can count the people who claim to have very ill on my two hands, and let’s just say they aren’t without other issues... and two were hospitalized for other things while testing Positive but reported it to us as a covid horror story. I can see your chart guy, you had sepsis post surgery with a side of a positive test and no covid symptoms. One was sepsis the other a chronic heart issue and positive test while in hospital. Neither had complications after discharge.</p>
<p>Anecdotal, sure. But my point is you could stand outside the grocery store and ask everyone the same things you ask your friends and acquaintances and likely get similar answers. Serious impact/death of covid alone is very very uncommon. </p>
<p>That’s even more damning to a doomers perceptive when you remember that “cases” are supposedly all around us. Positive tests everywhere! ... so false +s and actual infections are coming in contact with these people... death and illness are not.</p>

        <p>I'm an essential worker. I don't know anyone who has caught it. I know one person who knows one person who caught it and was asymptomatic, otherwise nobody else within one degree of separation from me has caught it. </p>
<p>Since I was never out of work and never locked down and mingling with people since the very first shutdowns, me and my coworkers should all be extremely high risk for exposure. But it's crickets.</p>

        <p>I'm also an essential healthcare worker. Can confirm, I have yet to know anyone who has caught it, nor do I see people just dropping dead in the streets. Our hospital was never overrun with cases, and we were even considered a "designated Covid center" when this all first went down. I've yet to change a single thing about my lifestyle, nor have the majority of my coworkers, so technically shouldn't we all be dead at this point?</p>

        <p>You want input sure. It is true that by the number media are reporting it's unlikely you will know a lot of people who catch covid-19. It is relatively a low number compare to the population after all. But do you know what we should be worried about? The wide spread of the disease that causes a good percentage of the population get infected. Let's say one out of one thousand patient need to be hospitalized, that's will easily overwhelm all the hospital and those who can't get treated will die, the death rate will be skyrocketed. That's literally what happened when covid-19 first spread over Wuhan China. Is that something you want?</p>

        <p>If not for technology, there would be no pandemic. People wouldn't be able to sit at home and work and order stuff online, and most people who don't know anybody who actually got sick from it wouldn't be constantly terrified by case numbers of mostly healthy people.</p>

        <p>My sister tested positive a month or so ago. She had a mild cold symptoms that went away after four or so days. Course I had to get tested to go back to work and I was fine. That’s all I’ve really heard in my personal life. Though I’ve heard someone at my brothers work tested post I’ve now they’re forcing people to wear mask there. Poor bastard.</p>

        <p>It's straight fucking propaganda. These headlines are every single day here and you would never know it without the internet screaming it at you. Nobody is keeling over and dying in the streets. There are no semi trucks carting the bodies away and dumping them in mass graves. There are no tents in the hospital parking lot. </p>

        <p>In the summer, South Carolina (my home state) had one of the highest per capita case rates. I know of a few acquaintances who have had positive tests, but all of them (healthy people in their 20s or 30s) would have thought "how weird, getting the flu in summer" if it wasn't for the media's constant hysteria. If it wasn't for the toilet paper hoarders and one-way signs in every grocery store, I wouldn't have noticed anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>I know one friend overseas who lost an elderly coworker to covid. But would "70-something year old woman dies of respiratory illness" be headline news before 2020? That's the life expectancy in most developed countries.</p>

        <p>I knew a few people who had it in March/April. Literally none since. </p>
<p>Only about 1/1000 Americans has gotten seriously ill from the virus (needed supplemental O2) and most of these people are 70-90 years old so the fact that you don’t know any of these people shouldn’t surprise you one bit.</p>

        <p>Even 1/1000 sounds high, does that count include the places where it was blown up beyond normal measures like nursing homes, etc? I would’ve guessed 1/10.000 hospitalized with severe cases, if not even fewer..</p>

        <p>Na it’s just a quick back of napkin calculation I did. According to CDC data, there have been a total of 1.8 million hospitalizations associated with Covid- kind of a lot but a lot of these are hospitalized patients who just happen to test positive for covid (like pregnant women). The total number of people admitted to ICU according to “covid tracking project” is only 26,584 which would be closer to 1/10,000 so I think you are right, with respect to ICU admits. I was more thinking people sick enough to need supplemental O2 which is obviously much higher than ICU admits.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen multiple articles saying it’s extremely bad in my county, a few even claimed that we were one of the worst 10 counties in the nation in terms of Covid. I have friends that have been acting like the world is ending for the past 8 months.</p>
<p>Still have yet to know someone who has gotten legitimately sick from Covid. </p>
<p>Our hospitals have been running at reduced capacity for pretty much the whole time. </p>
<p>I did the math and even according to the official death numbers we haven’t had any more people die than would normally pass from a little above average flu season. </p>

        <p>I live in a “overrun” state in the US. I go by my local hospital almost daily. Business as usual. I even drove by a “field hospital” that was set up inside a building, and I saw cars in the lot but no activity other than that. </p>
<p>If you listen to the news you’d expect a triage center like from a movie or something.</p>

        <p>EXACTLY. If you look to history at the Spanish Influenza, healthy young people were apparently getting up for work feeling fine, leaving their house and dropping to the ground. 
This is not a pandemic. It’s so hilarious to me that we can be told the sky is pink but not actually see it for ourselves. If it’s repeated enough it’s just accepted as fact. I’ve had it, my 60 year old parents had it (both with underlying issues) and we’re all grand. The swine flu was worse to be honest. 
It’s a global lie and it’s incredible they’ve got this far.</p>

        <p>It only makes sense if you see the numbers as they are. </p>
<p>328 million divided by the number of deaths (247,398 at the moment) equals a little over 1300. One out of every 1300 people in the US has died of this so far. How many of us even <strong>know</strong> 1300 people?</p>

        <p>Yes its nice now that there is a pool of actual known cases that you can reference and say "Well look at these 40 people of all ages, they all got Covid and they are all fine. How are you going to tell me this is so deadly?"</p>
<p>Otherwise everything just stays in the realm of the hypothetical, which is one of the problems of this whole thing.</p>

        <p>At 100k a day it would take 9 years for everyone to get infected. </p>
<p>I hear about cases,but imo most would not know it existed if not for the news. I know of someone 60+ who had. He had indigestion and food tasted funny. I've heard of people being sick with Rona for two days. I have heard of a few deaths at ethnic churches. I know of one fluke in which someone in their 30s presumably died of Cv19. </p>
<p>I think many people had it last year. It flew under the radar bc it was indistinguishable from flu or common cold for most people. If it were that bad, bodies wouldve been in the streets last year.</p>

        <p>Cases are not the same thing as positives.</p>
<p>Cases are like a "suspected infection", like a detective has opened a case into a possible crime.</p>
<p>Case can mean almost anything and has different definitions by region.</p>
<p>Now even if they meant "positive test result" that would still be overblown with false positives.</p>
<p>Most meaningful number are people going to the hospital, and even then that could be partially made up of hypochondriacs/fakers looking to get out of work.</p>
