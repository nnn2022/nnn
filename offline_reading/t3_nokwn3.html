<p>What is the different between rotational and translational motion?</p>
<p>Now, think outside of the box for a moment.</p>
<p>Why is translational motion of earth never talked about?</p>

        <p>I haven't been told to 'trust' science really, but I understand the scientific method. As far as I can tell, any reputable science is open to falsifiability. Scientists (that are reputable and do good work) would agree that falsifiability is one of the most important parts to doing good work in science.</p>
<p>The way we're told to 'trust the science^(TM)' lately is farther from the scientific method than just taking an educated guess. It's the exact opposite of real science. </p>
<p>About the rotational and translational motion question though: why that? What have you found? I'm curious though please don't take this the wrong way.</p>

        <p>I am being vague because it is a topic of discussion not related to this sub.</p>
<p>If you would like to find out more, just do some research into it and think about it some more.</p>
<p>And, yes, I agree, non-falsifiable "science" or any predictions/conclusions made that are non-falsifiable or cannot be proven wrong or simply verified via the actual scientific method is nothing more than pseudo-science.</p>

        <p>Glad we can agree on something :P</p>
<p>I haven't really done any mathematics related to gravity or orbit, but I have done a bunch of math related to physics and mechanical motion / mass / structures / properties of metals etc. </p>
<p>As far as I understand, rotational motion is rotation of an object about it's centre of mass (or its axis), where translational motion is motion of an object from one place to another (can be thought of as its axis moves).</p>
<p>Gravitational physics and orbits are somewhat more complicated than the stuff I studied, but as far as I can tell it's pretty sound. </p>
<p>The interesting thing to me is that mathematics describes things very well. </p>
<p>I'll look more into Heliocentrism but I'm not sure what you want me to discover about it, there's a lot of stuff I understand based on sound science on the matter already. </p>
<p>I get the feeling that you find something about Heliocentrism to be a lie? Forgive me if I'm making an assumption, I'm just interested in what you're talking about.</p>

        <p>Well, the crazy thing about math is that it is not science. </p>
<p>You could pretty much describe anything you wanted with math.</p>
<p>However, with science, that would not be the case.</p>
<p>There are two types of translational motion, slipping and non-slipping.</p>
<p>The earth, according to heliocentrism, experiences slipping translational motion.</p>
<p>Now, you could do the math and determine the motion of any given point on earth.</p>
<p>But, scientifically, have we ever attempted to measure this type of motion?</p>
<p>And, if so, has it ever been detected?</p>

        <p>Interesting question. </p>
<p>I do understand that mathematics is provable and therefore falsifiable, but yes I suppose it isn't a science per se. </p>
<p>I'm going to take a look at slipping vs non-slipping because I don't know the different at this point. </p>
<p>Also from what I understand, the motion of Earth relative to other celestial bodies has been measured and worked out via mathematics. But I will look up the slipping part to get more.</p>
<p>One thing I find interesting is that Neptune supposedly was discovered using mathematics before it was visually confirmed, due to changes in the positions in other bodies compared to the mathematical understanding at the time. It showed that bodies exhibit forces one one another from a distance. </p>
<p>Thanks for elaborating, much appreciated</p>

        <p>No problem.</p>
<p>Math is essentially a great tool.</p>
<p>But it should never replace the actual scientific method.</p>
<p>Sure, it could be used to assist us in making predictions.</p>
<p>But, the observational phenomena should never be replaced by it.</p>

        <p>One thing I came across just now was that slipping vs. non-slipping applies to objects where friction is involved (ex. a pool ball spinning backwards but moving forwards). In terms of Earth's rotation, I think the only source of friction could come from within the Earth itself, relating to fluid dynamics. I found an article about how the Earth's rotation slows and increases every few years (which I find hard to understand, given the Earth is such a massive object) but I would have to do the mathematics and make observations to confirm this for certain.</p>
<p>What is the implication of incorrectly or unmeasured properties of Earth's rotation in reference to other objects?</p>

        <p>The best way to describe the difference between non-slipping and slipping is to compare a tire of a bike on the road to a baseball (or really any kind of ball) being thrown from one point to another with any amount of spin.</p>
<p>Since the earth is not affixed to another physical object, i.e. a road, it would be considered slipping, however the equation to determine the angular velocity is not much different as the value of some variables are only determined by whether or not slipping is occurring.</p>
<p>When combining both rotational and translational motion, any given point on that object will change in angular velocity over time. This can be demonstrated, measured, calculated, predicted, etc. affirmed by the results while being observed.</p>
<p>However, as far as I am aware, we have yet to determine whether or not this is what is occurring to earth, as it should. The best we've come up with is Foucault's Pendulum, which allegedly demonstrates the results of the Coriolis effect which is caused by the rotation of the earth (even though other methods to detect rotation have failed).</p>
<p>However, the Allais effect, in my opinion, completely destroys the analogous presumptions of Foucault's Pendulum. Even Foucault's Gyroscope still has yet to be confirmed over almost 170 years since he's eluded to the fact that he was able to detect earth rotation via that experiment. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631070517301019">Foucault and the Rotation of the Earth</a></p>
<p>So, as far as the combined rotational and translational motions of earth, we should, by now, at least have been able to actually measure and confirm this to be true. Yet, other than what some articles may claim to be true, any sort of scientific experimental data by which actual measurements have been taken and presented in such a way that others could conduct the experiment themselves, we're left with the lingering sense that we should just "trust the science".</p>

        <p>Well, it's not really inconclusive.</p>
<p>They've made the assertion (that earth spins around sun).</p>
<p>Based on conjectured hypotheses with no conclusive evidence.</p>
<p>All while ignoring the alternative, which in my opinion, is not based in objective reality.</p>
