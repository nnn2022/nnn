        <p>Just remember this when they call you selfish for not wanting to wear a mask.  This was a truly selfish act.  She wasn't st risk for severe covid so taking the vaccine was 100% about vanity and virtue signaling.</p>

        <p>Like why is she posting this? This is the problem w social media and the world today.  Why do we need this dr telling  every pregnant woman out there that if you don’t get vaccinated against this disease that literally has no effect on you or your unborn child, you are a horrible person and your baby is a garage child and you are destroying your community.  As a woman who has been pregnant, telling us to do something w our bodies and our child is VERY controversial, which is why it takes years and years of medical based research and consensus before they tell pregnant women to do or not do anything.  Christ, the CDC took YEARS to tell women that having children back to back was not great for your body but it’s ok to get this random vaccine that HASNT BEEN TESTED ON CHILDREN?!?   Twenty years ago these people wouldn’t have had this platform and NO ONE would know about their stupid opinions other than their patients.</p>

        <p>I never understand why people call us “anti-Vaxxers” or “anti-science.” Questioning corporate America on the ethics and credibility of their products relating to our health and safety is always the right option, question everything, test everything, understand every possible risk that you can. </p>
<p>I have no clue why people think questioning the legitimacy of modern vaccinations is “anti-science” when in reality it’s very pro science. Every procedure has a downside, every surgical or injected procedure has unwanted side-effects and risks. It is up to the consumer or the patient to decide whether or not they want it and the doctors SHOULD BE REQUIRED to tell the patient every risk that is known with the procedure.</p>

<p>Vaccines are good, right?  And science is also good.  So, if you're "anti" those things, you are <em>ipso facto</em> bad and can therefore be ignored, openly ridiculed or, in extreme cases, physically harmed.</p>
<p>Some of us have been living like this for years due to various non-covid related beliefs, but now anyone can do it just by not wearing a mask.  Kinda sucks, doesn't it?</p>

        <p>First off, I don't mind being called Anti-Vax, but in reality I advocate for medical freedom.  I'm not against people getting vaccines if they want them... That said, </p>
<p>With all the multi million and multi billion fines in criminal cases for hiding negative side effects of drugs, the publicized governmemt/industry revolving doors, known conflicts of interest in the CDC/FDA advisory committees, the greed of the industry, etc... </p>
<p>What I don't get is that people are rightly suspicious of big pharma and the drugs it creates, but not the vaccines made by the same companies.</p>
<p>Everyone knows drugs have side effects, some of which take years to become apparent...  But few question the line that serious vaccine adverse events are "1 in a million" with no data to support that.</p>
<p>"Why would the government lie to me?" 
* to cover their ass. 
* they're on the hook for vaccine injuries. 
* NIH and CDC (and their employees) profit from patents they hold on vaccine technology. 
* any acknowledgement of danger would threaten public confidence in the vaccines.
* because management and regulators at FDA can quit, wait a year, then go to work for the companies they regulated at a much higher salary. </p>
<p>There's so much documentation of problems with vaccines.  Several peer-reviewed published articles have been written by government scientists, well respected doctors who've devoted their lives to vaccinating children, people involved in the development of vaccines, etc. </p>
<p>There's Stanley Plotkin under oath on video saying "in the absence of negative data I assume safety" </p>
<p>There's the CDC admission that wild polio was eliminated long ago and current polio cases are vaccine induced... </p>
<p>There's this statement from the FDA:  "However, although the continued availability of the vaccine may not be in immediate jeopardy, <strong>any possible doubts, <em>whether or not well founded</em>, about the safety of the vaccine cannot be allowed to exist</strong> in view of the need to assure that the vaccine will continue to be used to the maximum extent consistent with the nation's public health objectives. " (emphasis mine) (source: Federal Register, Volume 49 No.107, page 23,007 published June 1, 1984)</p>
<p>I could literally go on for hours on this topic. If anyone needs a source for something I stated in this post and you can't find it through Google or DuckDuckGo, send me a message.  I didn't have time to find all the sources this morning before work.</p>

        <p>Well, that is something I would never wish on anyone.  </p>
<p>Many of these new vaccines advise against pregnant women taking them.  </p>
<p>I just wish people would slow down and think about this, I hate the idea of mothers and/or their children being affected by such an decision.  </p>
<p>heartbreaking and frustrating</p>

Thalidomide babies were not that long ago, and women were gaslit for years that the birth defects were random/their fault, because science said thalidomide was safe.</p>
