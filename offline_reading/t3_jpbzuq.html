    <p><p>It's strange for me because when the March/April after the UK lockdown ended, I went to my local pub and explained to them that this was far from over, lockdowns aren't the answer and we need to fight for our freedoms. February, I was pro lockdown. I think most of us were, nobody knew what to expect but the more we advanced through lockdown, the more we started to realize the lies and the fear-mongering of our media outlets. (Remember bodies laying in the streets in China?)</p>
<p>At that time, I was told to shut up, grow up, and stop being selfish. Oh, how the tables have turned. Those same people are now posting regular updates on social media at how unfair the lockdowns are to their mental health, children's futures, economy etc. It's a bittersweet feeling.</p>
<p>Regardless of this small win, my biggest worry is the more lockdown restrictions are prolonged, the stricter they will get. Instead of fighting for what's right, the public will comply to try and return back to pre-COVID normal. Turning on their own families and neighbors. Real nazi territory. Obviously government propaganda will play its part unless we start to shun mainstream narrative. The biggest problem is we're relying on our government to tell us when we can return to normal and when it's "safe" again but when is that day going to come?</p>
<p>We rely on the government and the media so much that if it wasn't for them, the majority wouldn't have noticed COVID-19 exists.</p>
<p>We should note, that to protect us from terrorism, our technological life was intruded on a mass scale, for the safety of the nation. Is there still a threat from terrorism? Yes. Are we still being monitored? YES. Should we be monitored?</p>
<p>I note, the threat from viruses will never disappear. </p>
<p>I just hope the government doesn't use COVID as propaganda to intrude on our freedoms long into the future. Just as they do presently with terrorism.</p></p>
