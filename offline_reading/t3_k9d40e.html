    <strong>Nothing irritates me more than when people say, "Pull it above your nose"</strong>
    <p><p>I already wore a mask, which is going against my entire value system. Busybodies love to police even further and tell people how to wear the mask.</p>
<p>Today, I told a librarian to "go fuck himself" after he chased me down in the middle of an empty book section as I tried to read a book with my glasses and mask on, just to tell me to "put it above your nose". I love libraries. I haven't been in one since the hysteria started. Guess I won't be in one for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Nothing makes me more irate than people telling me how to wear the mask. I'm trying to get better at controlling my anger and engaging in a better discussion, but I'm struggling. I guess practice makes perfect. There will be more confrontations to come. It's funny, because before this, I never got into arguments with anybody and always followed the rules.</p></p>

        <p>I've caved in, just so I can try to go to certain places. I haven't been inside a library since March. They have security at the door and you can't get in without one. I just find it hilarious that this guy is chasing people down to tell them how to wear their mask. </p>
<p>This isn't the only place this has happened to me. It's happened at work, trying to change my phone plan, trying to get internet, the DMV, and a few more places.</p>
<p>I have had to wear a mask in certain places, or else go without a phone, car, internet, a job, etc.</p>

        <p>Yep. I'm in red country thankfully and there's still a number of stores that don't enforce mask policies. Those businesses have pretty much succeeded in getting my lifelong loyalty for that.</p>

        <p>I'm in red country also. I actually just moved to a state that is more red than the state I moved from - Alaska. Red states are better, but living in an urban area will suck regardless.</p>

        <p>Well, if I didn't cave in, I would not have a phone, internet, a car, glasses/contacts, an apartment, or a job right now. </p>
<p>I have been refused service at a number of places for not wearing a mask. I've been forced to do business outside in a snowstorm. I hate wearing a mask and have endured countless sneers and comments for the past year for not wearing one. There are times where I have had to wear one in order to live my life. </p>
<p>I envy those of you who live in places where you have not had to do such things, but I doubt that those places exist. I live in one of the most anti-lockdown regions of the country right now, and there are still lots of places that will kick you out and call the police for not having a mask.</p>

It's funny, because librarians are some of the most hypocritical people on earth. They like to brag about reading banned books, yet consistently promote banning books.

        <p>I worked at a library in my teens shelving books. You are so right. These supposedly feminist, super educated, culturally enriched older women were so mean to me. I got in trouble for not wearing a bra (why were they looking at my small chest that hard?) I got in trouble for taking my break one minute later than it was scheduled. I got in trouble for ‚Äútalking‚Äù because much older men would corner me and flirt with me and I was too shy/inexperienced with such things (at 15 years old) to tell them off.</p>

        <p>I agree! I recently had to walk out from an appointment to see if I have cancer because they would not budge on the mask policy. Long story short I have asthma I can only wear the mask over my mouth, and that wasn't good enough for them so I left. I did try to comply but I got faint, hyperventilated, and had a panic attack. So yea I've decided you give an inch they'll try to take a mile, I will no longer wear a mask period.</p>

        <p>How are you going to get around the medical clinic policy? Are you going to get a medical exemption? Kind of ironic, because to get a medical exemption, you probably have to wear a mask to the appointment. </p>
<p>I've been avoiding medical appointments until recently. I really need new glasses and I don't think there's any way for me to get around it, without creating a legal battle. </p>
<p>If you know of another way without a medical exemption, I'd love to hear it.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately in my state anyway clinics are allowed to set their own policies on masks, that's what a lawyer told me when I called to see what my rights were. </p>
<p>So I won't be going back to that clinic, I'll either find one that allows freedom to not wear masks, or ones that at least let you keep the nose uncovered or I guess I just won't go to any. Eventually itll get worse, meaning I fear most places will require a vaccine, then one day the chip. So this is good practice for me to stick to my morals and values, because no matter what I won't take the vaccine or the chip. </p>
<p>But yea I wish I knew an exemption, but even my asthma wasn't enough to exempt me. Sadly places don't have to honor medical disorders.</p>

        <p>Just ask them where they got the impression you feel like having a conversation with them and ignore them until they call the police or security. At which point you will probably be on your way out so you might as well just take off the mask anyway. </p>
<p>Otherwise I usually just pull the mask up, so the entire mask is over my noise without covering anything and thank them while carrying on with my business. Works especially well while walking through a store entrance.</p>

        <p>I did take the mask off after I told him off. If I could go back in time, I would leave out the swearing and state inconsistencies in his ‚Äúpolicing‚Äù</p>

        <p>I just don't understand, how bored and nosy do you have to be to be paying attention <em>that</em> closely to what random strangers around you in the supermarket are doing?  Doomers are all like "I WENT TO TARGET, AND I SAW 167 PEOPLE WEARING THEIR MASKS PROPERLY, BUT 28 PEOPLE HAD IT BENEATH THEIR NOSE AND 5 PEOPLE WEREN'T EVEN WEARING ONE AT ALL!!!11!!"  Seriously?  I couldn't describe <em>anybody</em> I saw in the store earlier today unless they were wearing a gorilla suit or something.</p>

        <p>I like to cough in public sometimes and see the scared looks of people around me. </p>
<p>Sometimes, I tell people at work that I don't feel well, just for kicks and giggles, and they all look scared, and then I say, "I'm cutting back on coffee and have a headache." Then, there are looks of relief that it's not covid. Hard to know who is actually scared of getting sick and who is scared of getting quarantined.</p>

        <p>I'm going off-topic. I've had to wear a mask at work and I've been yelled at for not having it above my nose. My point is, that people who enforce mask-wearing do have power. I've had to deal with petty tyrants enforcing mask behavior for awhile now, and I'm getting pretty sick of it. I think this is the fourth or fifth time I've told someone off for wearing it below my nose. I'm losing track.</p>
