        <p>You don't believe in science. You believe in the television. This is the crux of the problem. There is no place for "belief" in science. Once "belief" enters the picture science is out. Science is about questioning.</p>

        <p>Science is about searching for answers to the world in which we live. Nothing is ever proven absolute, rather, other possibilities are reduced/eliminated. Belief in science means believing in the scientific method and the results that come from it.</p>

        <p>Yes we agree. What is your point now? There is no conclusive evidence the vaccine has no long term side effect (duh! this is why there are clinical trials on-going until 2023) and there is strong statistical evidence that lockdown's were completely irrelevant in diminishing the spread of the virus.</p>

        <p>I'd actually really like to see your evidence on how lockdown doesn't work. I know the American lockdown failed drastically, but that's because nobody actually locked down. In many other countries, the citizens were given sizable stimulus checks, much more than the $1,400 and $600 that Americans got, and they have no covid because people were given enough money to actually stay home from work for a few weeks, but in America we didn't even get enough to pay for rent.</p>

        <p>People didn't lockdown in America. I truly am sorry for your loss, but that doesn't change the fact that people still went to work daily, meanwhile other countries paid the citizens enough money to live on and they all stayed home for weeks.</p>

        <p>The problem with the argument "if only we locked down hard enough" is that it is not based on a falsifiable premise (similarly to the argument : "if only true communism was tried!").  </p>
<p>It is likely that it is simply not possible for a country such as US to "lock down hard enough" because of structural issues. If that is the case we are arguing hypothetical impossibilities. </p>
<p>Surely you will bring up New Zealand and Australia. First of all those are islands, so border control is simpler, second they have committed a number of unthinkable abuses of international law (not letting their own citizens in for example) and in general the flow of information has been less than perfect (they have censored their own citizens in a heavy handed manner). </p>
<p>Finally there is the case of China, but clearly China is faking their numbers : even the biggest doomer will agree that there is a logical incoherence in the fact that India, China's neighbor has a huge epidemic and somehow China, with a population over 1 Billion only had 60k cases since the beginning of the pandemic. In fact China is the big mystery : all the information coming from there is very very very heavily censored.</p>

        <p>You are correct that I am basing a lot of my info on new Zealand and Australia. Locking out their own citizens is fucked up, but they paid the citizens who were in the country enough to do a proper lockdown, which is why the spread slowed and stopped.</p>

        <p>I'm totally willing to concede that they approached "worked" in your sense of "worked". So it seems that we agree on the facts and our differences are about what we perceive as acceptable in a democratic society. There is no point arguing over this. In general the stance of this sub is that restrictions such as lockdowns are not acceptable in a Western democratic society, since Western culture is based on the primacy of the individual will (e.g "cogito ergo sum" or "All men are created equal")</p>

        <p>Many people believe what you believe (by extension I'm guessing you believe in "maximizing the common good"), but my belief is simply along the lines that "the world is too complex to organize it in a top-down fashion and that the world organizes itself in an optimal way when every single individual is left to decide what is best for them (even when they are "wrong")". I also believe that "I cannot understand what is good for somebody else -- I am not inside their head" and by extension I believe that the "common good" is unknowable. </p>
<p>In the context of Corona this means that if you are scared of the virus then stay home and if you are not, then go about your life. If you are not scared and you are wrong and then you die then that's on you and if you were scared and wasted one year of your life for nothing then that's also on you. </p>
<p>People often misunderstand what "freedom" means. There is no freedom without the freedom of being miserable, of being wrong and making the wrong choice. Freedom for most people is too heavy a burden, they don't know how to handle it, this is why they like receiving orders so much. And yet freedom, for some of us, it means everything there is. Freedom is the freedom to try, it is the hope in this world, it is the reason why we have children, the reason why we live and wake up, even though freedom is not without its price, even though it brings unhappiness and tragedy at times.</p>

        <p>ok, sure.  compare the historic curve of historic viral pandemics to the wuflu.  how are they different?  how are they the same?  how are the curves different based on lockdown/non-lockdown?  respond to the proposition that viruses are going to do what viruses do and that lockdowns are ineffective at best.</p>

        <p>I'd like to ask you to not refer to the Corona Virus as the "wuflu" because that is incredibly racist. I also never said I would compare it to previous pandemics, as I don't know very much about them to make a fair argument on that.

        <p>I am not sure that it is any more racist than referring to Spanish flu as well... Spanish flu, or the Brazilian variant as the well... Brazilian variant... or the British variant as the ... British variant. The CCP lobbied very hard to rename the Wuhan Flu as COVID-19 since it diverted attention from their mishandling of the situation.</p>

        <p>Then you must realize how science changes, there is no "the science", there are many other variables at play when deciding policy, and that everyone is different with different needs and risk factors.</p>
<p>&rt;I believe masks work</p>
<p>In certain scenarios, sure. But not in the way that the world has been using them for the past year. I'm sure you must also realize how the vast majority of people render their masks near useless by wearing them improperly, touching them incessantly, storing them improperly, and/or not wearing a quality that's truly effective.</p>
<p>&rt;vaccines save lives</p>
<p>Sure, I have nothing against vaccines. Most people here don't at all. But obviously this particular one is different than others. If you wanna take the vaccine, feel free. You must know how useful it is, therefore don't try and force me to receive it too.</p>
<p>&rt;and (most importantly) the pandemic is real.</p>
<p>No one here legitimately believes that this virus doesn't exist, if that's what you're saying with that statement.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not trying to get any hate, or dish out any hate.</p>
<p>Well judging by your loaded questions and thinly-veiled insults, color me a just a little bit skeptical.</p>
<p>Best part of all of this is that you don't need "the science" to tell you if you're young, healthy, and unafraid of a virus with a stupidly high survival rate. Or that if you're so terrified and paranoid of this virus, especially at this point, then you should be staying inside. Protect the vulnerable, and take any and all personal precautions necessary in order to feel safe. You live your life, I live mine.</p>

        <p>I see we are throwing respect out the window on this discussion...</p>
<p>Masks work when used correctly but not in the way many people assume they do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your mask should always have at least 1 filter</li>
<li>Most filtered masks (excluding the n95) are meant to prevent exhalation into the air around us, not to prevent inhalation into our lungs. This means putting less of the virus into the air, rather than stopping yourself from breathing it in. Because of this, everyone should wear a mask because you can be asymptomatic for up to 2 weeks, exhaling Covid particles.</li>
</ol>
<p>Vaccines, they are shown to be safe, I understand that we don't truly know the long term health risks, but we have made predictions based on our understanding of how the vaccines work. When vaccines are offered for free (many places in America offer it for free, that's how I got mine) and there are no health risks currently present or predicted, I absolutely think a vaccine should be required for the herd immunity of those who cannot get the vaccine.</p>
<p>On the statement about the pandemic being real, I am new to this subreddit and I will admit that I don't know much about the people on here. That is why I made this post in the first place. I apologize for the misrepresentation.</p>
<p>I am curious however as to what loaded questions I asked, as I didn't ask any questions. I also didn't insult you at all (not on purpose, again I apologize for thinking you believed the pandemic was fake).</p>
<p>On your statement about living my life and you living yours, that's just not true. We live in a social world. If you think that for me to be safe I should take any personal precautions for the rest of my life so that you can continue to spread a virus killing millions daily (Covid kills more per day than 9/11 if you didn't know), instead of everyone just taking the precautions to eliminate the virus soon then I don't know where you got that idea from or how you can say you are an educated individual.</p>

        <p>I think what u/CarsonFacePalmer means is that we've been invaded by many of your type who come in here starting off exactly with what you wrote:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I respect your choice"</li>
<li>"I took the vaccine"</li>
<li>"I truly want to know why you don't want to take it"</li>
<li>"Science!"</li>
</ul>
<p>I've discovered several college/university kids writing papers about groups of people who don't want to take any of these vaccines. Also, we have those who come here who are just bored out of their minds, so they want to debate and challenge us. We're all mentally fatigued from this daily barrage of mentally deranged losers who have nothing better to do than mock, belittle, threaten or shame us for how we feel about these particular vaccines, as well as how this entire pandemic was nothing more than a giant psyop/scam. </p>

        <p>"I believe in science and I care about people, that's why I fully support the vaccine, mask mandates, and lockdowns. What about you guys? I swear I'm just here for a civil discussion btw." - that type of shit.</p>
<p>Not to mention, as you did, the dozens of trolls who come here every single day, 9/10ths of whom just post terrible memes in an attempt to insult the sub as a whole, or make a post about how "ur all so stupid lol fuck u all". Neither type has any desire to have any kind of legitimate discussion. Then there's the remaining 1/10th of people who actually bring some talking points to the table, and a reasonable argument. Unfortunately, many of those people also make posts similar to ones that I mentioned above. It does get quite old. Especially the exact same questions being asked over and over.</p>
<p>I always enjoy responding to opposing views, even if they're troll-ish, because it provides me a great opportunity to both see the other side, and to further strengthen my own argument - both of which help tremendously in real-life debates and discussions. But it's often difficult to get a halfway productive discussion going.</p>

        <p>&rt;I see we are throwing respect out the window on this discussion...</p>
<p>Nothing I said was even remotely disrespectful, unless you count me bringing to light your thinly-veiled insults.</p>
<p>&rt;Masks work when used correctly but not in the way many people assume they do:</p>
<p>You seem to be making my case for me. Someone who wears a dirty old piece of cloth over their face is treated as just as much of a saint as someone who wears an N95. There's no standard whatsoever, just "wear any kind of face-covering so people don't feel uncomfortable".</p>
<p>&rt;I absolutely think a vaccine should be required for the herd immunity of those who cannot get the vaccine.</p>
<p>All for a virus with a ridulously high survival rate, that primarily effects the very old and very vulnerable? Where people can easily just take several of their own precautions if they're concerned? People are already being vaccinated en masse, I don't see any reason that we need require vaccination for this thing, especially years down the line. Not to mention how that's such a steep and slippery slope, too.</p>
<p>&rt;On the statement about the pandemic being real</p>
<p>Just the entire sub is founded upon realizing that the virus is very real. We just don't approve of all of the incredibly harmful mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns that are/have been implemented.</p>
<p>&rt;what loaded questions I asked, as I didn't ask any questions.</p>
<p>Implied, being, "I'd like to really get to know why you don't believe in science." - effectively calling anyone who doesn't worship masks and this vaccine a science-denier. If you wanted to come here and actually have a rational, civil conversation, then making a post essentially calling everyone in the sub a Covid-denier, anti-vaxxer, and science-denier, is far from the best way to do so.</p>
<p>&rt;If you think that for me to be safe I should take any personal precautions for the rest of my life so that you can continue to spread a virus</p>
<p>Then what do you suppose we do, moving forward? There's no perfect solution. The best thing we can do is go back to normal. Vaccines are widely available, and there are countless other personal precautions you can take in order to be safe.</p>
<p>And you would have a point, that the people on my side should be the ones to give up out lives in order to not maybe potentially spread the virus with a crazy high survival rate, but that's not how society was prior to last year.</p>
<p>&rt;taking the precautions to eliminate the virus soon</p>
<p>What precautions and how soon? Cause we've seen that eliminating this virus, regardless of precautions taken, is not very feasable. The best thing we can do is to adapt.</p>

        <p>i want to start with saying that i do believe in science. 
masks - before the pandemic the cdc was very clear on masks not showing effectiveness. there are tons of peer reviewed studies showing they don’t work ESPECIALLY cloth ones and ESPECIALLY out in public in a well-ventilated facility. still, i’m not anti-mask. i am anti-forced masks though. 
vaccines- i’m not anti-vax either. i have many many vaccinations. 3/4 of the big pharma companies that are selling these vaccines have an extensive history in releasing products they knew would be harmful, distorting trials and testing, bribing doctors and have paid many billions in reparations. i am anti-forced vax or vax passport.
I absolutely believe covid is a real virus, i don’t think it calls for all the measures and drama.
another thing that makes all this suspicious is the fraudulent testing or rather misuse of the pcr test. 
Another thing, death rates didn’t really rise if you look at the data in 2020 in comparison to the past 50 years. nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>To be honest there are many many reasons I am a COVID skeptic but those are the major things you asked about. Thank you for asking respectfully!</p>

        <p>I'd like to start off by saying, thank you for responding respectfully. I think this will be a really nice conversation. I would agree that some companies put out products they know may harm the general public, however I believe the covid vaccines have been tested enough to say there isn't a reason not to get one. On top of this, many places give the vaccine for free (I'm a college student in America, I got mine for free without even providing my college ID). There are some health risks, for instance the vaccine I got, Johnson and Johnson, had I believe 7 women get blood clots 13 days after the shot but when millions got the shot and only 7 had that result, and they survived (they couldn't find a target group that this would happen to, for example they had different blood types) they still highly recommend the vaccine and so would I.</p>
<p>Long story short, TLDR; I think when there is an option that is free, healthy, and can save not only your life but those around you, you have no excuse to not get it so I kinda do agree with requiring vaccines for things. Especially since some people can't get it due to health concerns and they need herd immunity.</p>

        <p>There is literally zero science to prove that the vaccine is “healthy”. Quite the contrary. I suggest checking out the VAERS data for COVID-19 vaccine related deaths. Don’t come here claiming to believe “the science” then ignore it when it disproves your beliefs.</p>

        <p>another issue i thought of when reading your reply is the way “covid deaths” are counted. no matter what the patient dies of, at the height of covid, they were counting anyone who’s had the virus in the past 60 days as a covid death. i believe that many many people died with the virus rather than from it. the data on death rates also supports this opinion. while for vaccines, there have been much higher numbers of bad reactions to the vaccine but the argument of reaction with the vaccine rather than from it has silenced soso many of these cases. but to be honest, for me it’s more about vaccine passports. i believe it’s a persons choice what they choose to do with their bodies but i am a libertarian so that’s just the libertarian in me. thank you for your respectful disposition, it’s quite refreshing!</p>

        <p>I am aware of this issue yes, they do inflate the deaths. When somebody HAS covid, I would say that it is fair to mark it as a Covid death, assuming it was because of the symptoms (not a car crash). However if somebody HAD covid previously and they survived it, I wouldn't mark that as a covid death.</p>
<p>By vaccine passports, do you mean requiring the vaccine to enter a country or something smaller like a restaurant? I think the idea of a country requiring a vaccine is very fair during the pandemic, though perhaps once we return to not wearing masks and having social gatherings they could be no longer required. Meanwhile, businesses do have the right to deny service to those whom they choose. For instance, if I was a cashier at a local grocery store (I used to have this exact job), and a 'karen' was nagging me, I could refuse to check out her items.</p>

        <p>i’m aware they have the right to refuse service but i don’t think they should even be asking about one’s medical history. in florida, gov. desantis has made it illegal to require or ask for proof of vaccination and i’d agree with that</p>

        <p>i’ve seen a couple of your other comments so i’ll add a few points. i don’t believe lockdowns have been productive. i’m not sure where you’re from but here in canada we’ve been in lockdown for over a year now. it isn’t good for physical or mental health. makes immune systems weaker and more susceptible to covid. again another libertarian view i’ll throw out - i believe those who are high risk should lockdown if they wish and anyone who would be fine can be out and about. now that doesn’t mean we have to be in each others faces but i believe lockdowns have done much more harm than good.</p>

        <p>I'm in America, may I ask how much you got in government payment in Canada? Some countries got as much as 7000 which meant they had enough to live on and therefore did a proper lockdown instead of just cancelling social events like America did.</p>

        <p>That's really interesting, in America we got $2000 total and that was supposed to last us this whole time. That money is meant to be spent on small businesses so as to keep money circulating and to prevent another depression like we had last century.</p>

        <p>&rt; I think when there is an option that is free, healthy, and can save not only your life but those around you, you have no excuse to not get it so I kinda do agree with requiring vaccines for things. Especially since some people can't get it due to health concerns and they need herd immunity.</p>

        <p>I most certainly believe in Science and the efficacy of vaccines. However, vaccines are not a panacea is Science has lost it's purity. I've grown old enough to look at public officials and 'Experts' with a jaundiced eye. It has taught me the lesson that we all hear about and ignore for most of, and sometimes all of our lives.</p>
<p>FOLLOW THE MONEY. Billionaires are being created almost overnight right now and every one of them has a vested interest in making sure we all get the 'jab'. Their motives are suspect as soon as their profit margin is tied to our fear and acquiescence and I don't trust them.</p>
<p>Be pragmatic. The money is in treating sickness, NOT curing it.</p>
<p>NONE of the vaccines are FDA approved. While I support your right to 'roll the biological' dice on the vaccination, I'd like to be respected for my right to wait until the 1st phase testing yields results (If you're wondering what the 1st phase testing is, well; you're it.).</p>
<p>These are literally, in every sense of the words, the Human Trials. <strong>Not a single person on the entire planet even knows what the median effects will be, let alone, the long term effects of the vaccines. I'm happy to let the brave ones go first.</strong></p>
<p>MASKS.</p>
<p>Masks work. I frequently wear them for work (minimum N95). I also use dual cartridge respirator masks, both half and full-face. The cartridge used, depends on the nature of the work. They're not all the same. But, in the appropriate situation, masks work.</p>
<p>Yours don't. Sorry, but what I see the average person wearing, wouldn't even cut it for sanding drywall.</p>

        <p>Could it be possible that the billionaires want us to get vaccinated so that we can return to normal life again. They as well are on lockdown. Just because they have bigger property and more money doesn't mean they don't miss the little things. Hell, the thing I look forward to most after all this is getting out of my dorm room and going to the bathroom without wearing a mask, I really don't care much for bowling alleys, movie theaters, etc. but the bathrooms, I want my public bathrooms back. </p>
<p>On your statement about me being stage one in the vaccine testing, that's just simply not true. Vaccines go through numerous testing stages (I'll admit I don't remember exactly but I think it's 4) before being released to the public. Stage 1 starts with a very small number of people who are considered healthy enough where they believe the person won't die if the vaccine fails. These phases go up and up in the amount of people and once a threshold is crossed it is considered safe to give to the public.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Masks work, I'm glad we can agree on that. We disagree that the n95 is the only mask that is effective though. I think you see it as the only mask that works (correct me if I am wrong please). However  I see it as the mask that works the best, meanwhile other masks, so long as they are filtered, are still effective. I would agree that cloth masks are essentially pointless.</p>

        <p>Firstly, I think it's adorable that you believe the power brokers are following the same rules and suffering the same deprivations as the rest of us. That makes it the first time in recorded history, that it has happened. Truly, a Watershed moment.
And N95's are FAR from the best. They are just the base rating for a mask that can actually be considered 'Protection'.
Seriously, Look up the size of the gaps on an N95 and compare those 'doors' to the size of a Virion. The virus can pass through an N95, as if it was doing an impersonation of the "Rockettes" with all of it's friends.</p>

        <p>I will give you an example of something that smelled fishy to me and I'll concede right at the start that it proves nothing.</p>
<p>I work in manufacturing.  In the opening couple weeks of the Covid situation, as regional management by governors amounted to uniformly shutting down non essential business our company was designated essential.  We service among a great variety of customers, food and drug companies as well as defense contractors.  We were anticipating the entirety to be shut down and this offered a ray of financial hope because so many nonessential jobs were evaporating and people were left wondering how they would be feeding their families.</p>
<p>The items at the center of this are floor stickers- round ones, done very professionally.  About six inches and round they bore foot shaped print, arrows with "6 feet" and "Social distancing"... the phrase whose prominence was presumed to be a direct reaction to the exploding pandemic.  This was not a shipment of exit signs, caution tape, or something like "Authorized Personnel Only"--- items for which templates already existed.</p>
<p>These high quality, professionally done floor spacing instructional decals were conceived, designed, equipment configured, printing plates set, etc., manufactured, packaged, and shipped to us at a time when we were being told that any and all interstate commerce outside of the big three (feed 'em, treat 'em, and kill 'em) was being strictly forbidden.. so serious the prohibitions (or so we thought) that each of us employees kept in our vehicles a copy of the letter certifying us as essential workers from corporate ceo and signed by the HR director- lest  vigilant law enforcement question why we were out when the  order of the da, in our own Governor's words: "Stay home, stay safe".</p>
<p>We were experiencing delays in receiving materials for our operation, items that already existed.  Yet somehow, as the shutdown orgy went into full swing, the newly minted (now cliché) "social distancing" phrase appeared on a commodity created specifically for this particular pandemic would show up at our facility within two weeks.</p>
<p>Is it impossible for that to happen in such a short time?  No, but to me it seems very improbable.</p>
<p>It's late and I need my sleep, but there are innumerable other things- much in the news, guidance, and measures taken by leaders that ranged from mildly idiotic to downright murderous.</p>

You talk about scientific method, but then blindly believe, and trust virologists, who have never practiced scientific method.

        <p>Do you know what makes a scientific study, scientific? The study must be controlled and the results just be observable, repeatable, and quantifiable. If I expose myself to a sick person, I am highly likely to get sick (this is an observation, I could do it more than once and do could anyone else, and you can measure the time difference between exposure and showing symptoms)(assuming I'm not vaccinated from whatever they have) because airborne diseases travel... through the air and therefore I would be breathing in the pathogens they exhale. How's that for an experiment? Since you don't believe the virus exists you should run this experiment, just go into hospitals with covid patients and get REAL close to them.</p>

        <p>Masks do nothing for airborne viruses, plenty of studies before COVID showing this. The particles COVID travels on are too small to be stopped by a simple cloth mask, you need a freaking industrial respirator to have any effect. Now as for the vaccine unlike most of this sub I am extremely pro vaccine because we have tons of data showing it works extremely well hence why I got it. As for me now? Since NY doesn't have any mandate I have ditched the mask completely and I am only supporting companies who don't require them</p>

        <p>And how many are wearing n95 masks correctly? None. This is why we see spikes in countries with "medical mask mandates" like Germany. Honestly with vaccine supply so plentiful in the US I am done protecting idiots who refuse to get vaccinated they can go have fun with coronavirus.
