        <p>Exactly my mom was talking to a handyman we have at the house my dad brought up Vaccines I was not in the room but ofc my mom said I cant take it bcz I have asthma and kidney  problems etc my dad took it and when it came up to me my mom just said he doesn't belive in them...</p>
<p>.I told her no it's not that It's just as a healthy 22-year old I see no reason why I should take the mRNA therapy for myself or anyone else. Simple as that she doesn't care but my dad has to bring that up whenever someone new is in the house pisses me off</p>

        <p>I find it strange these people truly do want to move on and get back to normal per se but they have a mental block in the sense that in their eyes we need some kind of "solution"</p>
<p>Keep in mind many places around the world have opened up many places similar to Ontario in size and close in geography like Michigan never locked down nearly as hard and are doing the same eg cases</p>
<p>Denmark opened up at 20% vaccinated but for some reason, these people that want the same thing as us to live life again never have the thought that maybe what happened was not needed</p>
<p>In Ontario, we have 14 million people and 1,076 million km2 of land in Ontario.... Compare that to somewhere like the greater Los angles area that has 18 million people and 12,562 km2..... It was utter insanity what happened always was</p>
<p>But they have a mental block where they cant see it as overreach they see it as needed to stop the virus so therefore we cant just get rid of that stuff we need to have a solution to get rid of it.</p>
<p>When in reality all we have to do is stop forcing masks and make them recommended not required like Alberta and BC and many people would be much happier in Ontario.</p>
<p>IMO Nobody should be forced/coerced to take it but beyond that, some people legitimately shouldn't take the vaccine for health reasons such as my mother who has Asthma and Kidney problems which all of the therapies say do not take if you have so I don't understand how so many people in Ontario have fallen victim to this and it makes me depressed daily!</p>

        <p>I understand that I just dont want them to force their ways on me....</p>
<p>The thing is these same people that think this way will refuse to admit that things are even being coerced or forced like masks....</p>
<p>They just don't think about it because they agree with it... People really only care if things they don't like are forced or coerced</p>

        <p>As someone who also lives in Ontario, I can only hope that those double vaxxed booster shot loving folks will die off in droves like those who suffered the black death. </p>
<p>Then our wages can go up and we can afford a house.</p>

<p>Dont expect the moon now remember it's Canada! /s</p>
<p>In all seriousness,My folks are moving to Nova scotia in the next year and I'm debating joining them just to get out of Ontario Even BC and Alberta dont force masks anymore but I live in a rural town of 9k ppl and still forced masks for stores its insane</p>
