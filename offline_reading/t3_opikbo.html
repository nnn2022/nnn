    <strong>How to explain why you don‚Äôt want the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>What are you go to responses when people ask why you‚Äôre not getting the vaccine? I try to bring up the obvious: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>doesn‚Äôt stop you catching or spreading the virus </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not a normal vaccine it‚Äôs gene therapy and not properly tested (I don‚Äôt want to be infertile!) (better to be safe and wait, then be sorry!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>covid is a 99.9% survival rate for my age group and health status.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>but most people I speak with think this all isn‚Äôt true and that I‚Äôm misinformed (and won‚Äôt take the time to look at my resources) üò© </p>
<p>what‚Äôs your go to way to explain the situation to ‚Äúsimple minded‚Äù people (I mean that respectfully, just the best way I can think to describe)</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not gonna fall for the peer pressure but my boyfriends family is really pushing him and I don‚Äôt want him to die/ not make babies with me‚Ä¶ how do I convince his family to stop pressuring us? Send help ‚ù§Ô∏è</p></p>

<li>
<p>Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson have both been sued in criminal lawsuits for lying about the safety and usefulness of different products for a net loss of over $30 billion between the two. These companies have already lost some trust with that fact alone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moderna was worth billions before they ever made a single dollar in sales, which means that billions in allocated funds and assets absolutely REQUIRES Moderna to vaccinate as many people as possible to make money for their shareholders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of these companies can be sued if their vaccine harms you in any way. They've already harmed hundreds of thousands of people with other products, that's how they got sued.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It sets a crazy authoritarian precedent to require that the population has to consume a product into their bodies that comes from a company that is publicly traded for profit, in the S&amp;P 500 no less.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>India was experiencing massive breakthrough cases in December/January and the global media ignored it. I saw very early on that the vaccines were very likely to start failing and cause more damage than good.</p>

        <p>There is no recourse if you are harmed by these vaccines, no matter how severe and costly the injury is. The vaccine companies can't be sued, the pharmacists that give the shots can't be sued, the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program doesn't cover EUA vaccines like this one, health insurance won't cover you, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Of course, there's a ton of other problems with these vaccines, but just the fact there's no recourse on them is a huge red flag.</p>

        <p>I've had Covid and don't need the jab, and I've been anti Covid jab for a while. </p>
<p>But the more I've researched into it and read the actual science to how these jabs work, I think most people would be better off just getting it rather than choosing to just take Covid instead. </p>
<p>Most of the serious side effects from the jab Is your own bodies immune response, not any specific thing in the jab. The spike protein in the jab is also less than the spike protein from actual Covid.</p>
<p>I lot of the big claims made on here about the jab also apply directly to any virus including Covid. </p>
<p>For eg. Myocarditis (heart inflammation) is due to your immune response and can happen as a rare event to any virus including the immune response from the jab. </p>
<p>The biggest issue with the jab that I still need more info on is the toxic nano coating they are using to transport the mRNA. But all these immune related side effects are just part of life and cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>Nothing I've said here is to promote the ridiculous tyranny we are experiencing and we need to fight against passports at costs.</p>

        <p>I think you have a very sensible response.</p>
<p>&rt;The spike protein in the jab is also less than the spike protein from actual Covid.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, Dr. Robert Malone has stated he doesn't think the spike proteins from the jab are toxic, but he could see how they could be in theory.  Of course, more study is needed.</p>
<p>&rt; For eg. Myocarditis (heart inflammation) is due to your immune response and can happen as a rare event to any virus including the immune response from the jab. </p>
<p>You are correct here.  I got myocarditis from another vaccine 8 years ago.  It can be caused by immune response or virus.</p>

        <p>I actually remember having a very tight chest when I had Covid, wonder if it was anything similar.</p>
<p>Im against forcing the jab on anyone because there's no trust and it's rushed, but on the other side of the coin I haven't seen anything (and Ive followed this sub daily for weeks) that has convinced me that they are more dangerous than catching the virus itself or any other immune response. </p>
<p>There is a big one circulating that the body will continually make spike proteins and they cause all sorts of inflammation continuously long term. I had to read 3 long articles before understanding that that reasoning is totally flawed. </p>
<p>I think it's very difficult for anyone in a non-risk group to make a good decision on taking the jab or not because there's a ton of misinformation and censorship on both sides of the argument.</p>

<p>This is why I am holding off for now, I had myocarditis from other vaccines and I'm not high risk because I've been working from home for the foreseeable future and can easily limit my contact with strangers.</p>

        <p>Interesting. I‚Äòd like to present you my counterarguments for these responses:</p>
<p>1.) Yes, it does not 100% prevent an infection. It does however reduce the chance of being infected compared to an unvaccinated person in the same position. The effectivity varies among the vaccines and goes from 60% to 95%. This is important, because this pushes the R-value below 1, which means covid slowly dies out. </p>
<p>2.1.) The vaccine is not gene therapy. Gene therapy implies that our genes are altered in any way, which is not true. Genes, which are made of DNA, are not used in the vaccine, just RNA. The difference between DNA and RNA can be shown when you imagine a cell as a computer: DNA is the hard drive, made for permanent storage. RNA is the RAM, very volatile but fast. Before anything can be done on a computer, you have to first copy the stuff from the hard drive to the RAM. Same with the cells. Our cells make RNA from DNA, and make proteins from the instructions in the RNA. The other way round is not possible: RNA cannot become DNA. Therefore, there is no way the RNA-vaccine modifies the human genes in any way. </p>
<p>2.2.) The vaccine not being tested is misinformation. Every vaccine on the market (at least here in the EU, idk for the US) went trough the standard three phases of clinical trial, the same as every other vaccine or med, and has been approved based on the same laws. Given, they completed the phases much faster than usual, but that is because of the increased budget because of the urgency.</p>
<p>3.) Assuming you are 20-30, my quick google search showed a mortality of 0.2% for you. That‚Äòs pretty low. But there are multiple points you also have to consider: 1. If you get the vaccine, you can save others lives which may have a higher mortality rate. For example, 60+ has ~10%. This is about solidarity in our society. If the numbers were reversed for the age group, I‚Äòm sure you‚Äòd also like to have the others show solidarity. 2. The vaccine not only lowers mortality, but also the chance of long or permanent health complications. In the case of covid, you can get long lasting lung problems because of scar tissue in your lungs, just to name one.  3. Those considerations are also made by the people who are in charge of recommending vaccines. Of course every vaccine has side effects. But for one person,  getting vaccinated has less health complications and less severity than if you don‚Äòt get it. </p>
<p>If you don‚Äòt want the vaccine then I cannot force you. Although I don‚Äòt like your decision, I can respect it if you base it on sound arguments. But these arguments are not sound and not rational.</p>

        <p>Sorry but running a "quick google search" for the single, most vital piece of data when it comes to risk/benefit calculations ruins the entire credibility of your post. The IFR for Covid in 20-30 year olds is in the likes of 0.01%, quite the order of magnitude lower than what you baselessly asserted.</p>

        <p>No, it does not ruin the credibility of my whole post, because not all my arguments rely on this data. You have a good argument (that I did not back up my data) but you use it to evade my other arguments.
Anyway here is my source:</p>
<p>https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/</p>
<p>Just scroll down to ‚ÄûAge of Coronavirus Deaths‚Äú</p>
<p>May I see a source for your claim of 0.01%? Also, what is your opinion on my other arguments?</p>

        <p>Your source refers to the case fatality rate which is a next to useless metric if your aim is to assess risk. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2918-0/figures/2">Here</a> is one source showing the infection fatality rate by age.</p>
<p>I couldn't really care less whether you refer to the shots as vaccines or gene therapies. That's far from being a factor in my decision to get or to not get injected.</p>
<p>I think that injecting entire populations with leaky vaccines in the midst of a pandemic is unprecedented, understudied and not based on any sound arguments. While the unvaccinated could in theory provide the virus with a higher chance of random mutation by virtue of more viral replication, it is the pressure exerted by the vaccinated that is causing immune escape variants to propagate.</p>

        <p>&rt; 1.) Yes, it does not 100% prevent an infection. It does however reduce the chance of being infected compared to an unvaccinated person in the same position. The effectivity varies among the vaccines and goes from 60% to 95%. This is important, because this pushes the R-value below 1, which means covid slowly dies out. </p>
<p>You might want to look up leaky vaccines and what happens.  In the case of Marek's disease in Chickens, the vaccine had poor effectiveness.  The virus mutated and became more deadly to unvaccinated chickens.</p>
<p>Everyone is scared about mutations in the unvaccinated, but mutations can happen in the vaccinated.</p>
<p>&rt;  2.1.) The vaccine is not gene therapy.  </p>
<p>The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are classified as gene therapy by the FDA.</p>
<p>Moderna's filings to the SEC and investors refer to this fact.  </p>
<p>&rt; 2.2.) The vaccine not being tested is misinformation. Every vaccine on the market (at least here in the EU, idk for the US) went trough the standard three phases of clinical trial, the same as every other vaccine or med, and has been approved based on the same laws. Given, they completed the phases much faster than usual, but that is because of the increased budget because of the urgency.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that the data is still being reviewed.  If all testing was complete, we'd have full approval and licensing by now. </p>
<p>You're also forgetting the fact that this is the first time an mRNA vaccine has been deployed on a large scale.</p>
<p>You may also want to look at this article:
https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/05/09/527575055/one-third-of-new-drugs-had-safety-problems-after-fda-approval</p>
<p>&rt;  1. If you get the vaccine, you can save others lives which may have a higher mortality rate. For example, 60+ has ~10%. This is about solidarity in our society.</p>
<p>The onus is on the people at risk to take necessary precautions, the majority of the population is not at risk.  </p>
<p>This also brings up an important point in bio-ethics:  When have we ever given an experimental treatment, to the young, healthy and productive members of society who are largely immune to virus negative consequences in order to save the old, sick and frail?  In other words, you're giving children who are immune and not at risk from COVID a medicine with unknown side effects, so that their 90 year old grand parents can like a couple more years if that.</p>

<p>Yeah, that is of course not cool, but you are drawing the wrong conclusion. The virus got stronger despite the vaccine, not because of it. The same deadlier mutation could've also happend without vaccine, but with higher propability, because of more virus reproductions.</p>

<p>Your explanation would be true, if evolutionary pressure did not exist.</p>
<p>&rt;  I'm gonna need a source for your claim about the FDA. Here in the EU, it is not classified as gene therapy, because it is no gene therapy.</p>
<p>I told you the source, look at the submitted SEC documents.  </p>
<p>From Moderna's 10-K filing, submitted on Feb. 26, 2021, page 106</p>
<p>&rt; Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA. Unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell DNA and could act as a source of side effects, mRNA-based medicines
are designed to not irreversibly change cell DNA; however, side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the perception of mRNA medicines despite the differences in mechanism. </p>

<p>If the trials are not over, then it is not fully licensed and approved.  In the US for example, it is approved for emergency use which means it is not fully approved/licensed.  </p>

        <p>&rt;Your explanation would be true, if evolutionary pressure did not exist.</p>
<p>Immune escape is a desireable trait for every virus, not only those vaccinated against. The evolutionary pressure is the same.</p>
<p>&rt;Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA.</p>
<p>The FDA is stupid in this case. mRNA is still no gene therapy.</p>
<p>&rt;I haven't seen much to indicate that the side effects in children.</p>
<p>Again, children don't get vaccinated anyway, so idk what you want to reach here, as they are out of consideration.</p>
<p>For age 20+, side effects have been observed both from covid and a vaccine. But for covid they are more likely and more severe for every age group. Corona won't go extinct, it will become endemic. So eventually you'll either get the vaccine, or you'll get covid. So question for you: if you have to play russian roulette with a 1000 barrel revolver or a 100,000 barrel revolver, which one do you choose?</p>
