        <p>There are actually doctors who believe that nonsense. My friend asked his doctor why there was no flu and he said that it's just all mixed up with covid right now. Well, are you treating every patient like a covid patient even though you know that at least some of them just have the flu? Then the doctor recommended my friend get a flu shot lol</p>

        <p>Did you actually look at that source???? They are barley testing for the flu. We were doing ~2 million corona tests every single day in the United States a few months ago. When you don’t test for something, funny how it just disappears 🤡</p>

        <p>Thanks for posting this! Data and facts matter. Perhaps the flu numbers have decreased this much because of: mask wearing, social distancing/quarantining, people not traveling trans-continentally, and increased hygiene habits?? This actually proves how much more contagious Covid-19 is when compared with the seasonal flu, along with how much more deadlier Covid-19 is then the flu (1-3% vs 0.1% mortality). This separation is getting greater as Covid-19 continues to mutate into more contagious and possibly, deadlier variants. I'm a registered nurse btw and people like you on this sub are the bane of my existence. Godspeed</p>

        <p>I will post the data when I find it's useful, but ~~I'm~~ the Influenza numbers really have me racking my brain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mask wearing - I don't think this could be the cause, because if you look at states that have a mask mandate vs. state that don't, there is virtually no difference in the amount of covid cases. If it has absolutely no effect on covid, it can't possible have a measurable effect on Influenza.</li>
<li>Social distancing - Let's split this up into two categories, the 6-feet rules and simply people staying at home instead of going outside. The 6-foot rule isn't going to have an effect, the direction that the wind is blowing can change the distance for transmissions down to 0 feet and up to 30 feet. Regarding people staying at home, it could have an effect, but I wouldn't say that every 100 instances where someone wants to leave their house 99 times they are now staying at home. So it's not enough to explain a 100x decrease.</li>
<li>Trans-continental travel - This might be an explanation for Europeans, but it would cause ~~higher~~lower cases in the US. Up until recently the US has had consistently higher cases than everyone else in the world, so travel wouldn't cause the numbers to raise in the US. Early last year there was this ridiculous belief created by the media that travel somehow creates covid cases out of thin air, as if the act of moving from one place to another generates covid, I'm glad that phase is over.</li>
<li>Increased hygiene - This is the most likely explanation. People are just a little bit more careful now, washing their hands when they get home and not touching dirty things. I supposed combined with the other things mentioned, it could cause a 100x decrease. This should affect covid proportionally though.</li>
</ul>

        <p>This is one of the more reasonable comments I’ve seen on the topic, and I commend that. But I’m going to flag a similar theme that’s an issue with the points you bring up. Actually, there are two, tho they come from a similar source. </p>
<p>The first is mixing causation and correlation. And the second is assuming a linear relationship between numbers. I’ll focus on the former for this comment though. For example, your bullet point on mask wearing. </p>
<p>You use states that have versus don’t have a mask mandate to compare effectiveness of masks on reducing transmission. This assumes a directly causal relationship between the status of a mask mandate and reduced transmission rates. While it might be safe to correlate them, assuming a causal relationship is a logical error because it ignores many potential confounding variables in the relationship between proposed cause (status of mandate) and the proposed effect (transmission numbers). </p>
<p>In reality, confounding variables include population, population density, demographic makeup, concentration of comorbidites, and countless others. Basically we’re asking them, what are the causal effects on differentiated covid rates (or lack thereof)? Is it the status of the mandate (a binary variable), is it one of those other variables mentioned, or some combination? So while your statement may still hold true, it can’t be demonstrated as causal using the logic you’ve followed.</p>

        <p>God I have this same issue though here in America.  My friend is an assistant to a doctor. She means well. But LORDY she simply parrots everything she hears on TV or is told by the doctor. And he’s as you might expect the average doctor to be. I brought up the lack of flu and she straightway went to the masks, quick as lightening. She pointed out how effective they are with the lack of flu cases 😂I offered her many articles about those masks and the studies showing they were not effective, but thus far she’s declined to look at them 😬)</p>

        <p>Yea I realized pretty quick "when I got the flu as a kid, I would never wear a mask." My mom would come into my room to give me food and she'd sit down and talk with me. We weren't thinking about respiratory particles or anything like that. And it was fine I don't think I ever gave my mom the flu, when I was getting it every year! </p>

        <p>Only true in countries that did a half-assed lockdown. The countries that locked down properly and no longer have cases are doing better than before. Turns out it was the people complaining about how it will affect the economy that were the problem.</p>

        <p>Not true, some countries could lock down for short periods and such much easier than larger nations. Places like New Zealand were very successful bc they are small, have little to no immigration generally, closed their borders, and we're able to lock down right for a short period. That is simply not feasible in the US and even if it were, the govt shows they don't even care about doing it well bc they're bringing in loads of immigrants during a pandemic anyway. </p>
<p>Don't gaslight people and say it's their fault, "if only you'd surrendered your rights more readily to a govt we all know couldn't give less of a shit about us, you wouldn't have to deal with the negative consequences of the government forcefully locking you down to destroy small businesses and give their market share to billionaires." The differences between nations that handled covid well and those that didn't isn't whether or not they did a serious lockdown or resisted one, it's a wide variety of other factors.</p>

<p>Yeah, but the major factor is how seriously they took the lockdown. A key example is Sweden vs. its neighbors.</p>
<p>And if anyone's gaslighting, it's you. Trying to tell people they're wrong for blaming people not sitting down for TWO TO FOUR WEEKS so that this shit can just go away. It's you dumbasses that refuse to socially distance, shelter in place, wear a mask, etc. that are the reason the small businesses are fucked right now. You prolong the pandemic.

        <p>I'm not bowing down to the government; I've had first-hand experience with covid. I'm not doing any of this shit because the government told me to, and in fact, I was following these precautions as soon as it was apparent that it was going to be a problem (early-to-mid March), quite a bit before lockdowns were in place.</p>
<p>It's weird how this was already a problem before lockdowns. Most governments took too long to address the issue and locked down way too late, yet somehow it's the lockdowns that are causing it all. Really makes you think, huh?</p>

        <p>When I was working in healthcare, no one was being tested for the flu anymore. No one. We couldn't even bill for a flu test anymore. Everyone was just tested for Covid when they reported any flu/cold symptom because it was more $$$ for the facility. Also, in the general population Covid tests were free for anyone. Are you going to go get tested for the flu and pay for the office visit and the test? No, not when you swing through the CVS next to your house for a free Covid test every single day. Being Covid and the flu are both corona viruses and the PCR tests are known to be faulty. The flu would cause a positive Covid test in my opinion. </p>
<p>1,800 cases this year is them literally putting it in our faces that Covid is the flu and people are doing mental gymnastics even on this sub to justify that its not... like "but people only stayed in one region and never went anywhere that's why" or "the masks stopped the flu". Ok so what then causes Covid cases?</p>

        <p>Because they saw a person pass out in a street in Wuhan on TV last year and they also don't read much apart from "fact checker" websites, so they haven't yet learned that no Sars-Cov2 coronavirus strain has ever been isolated, purified or proven to be both infectious and transmittable.</p>

        <p>Thought it was because a lot of flu cases were being counted as covid instead?  Covid is real; it’s a lot more similar to the flu than the media would have you believe, but it’s not the flu.  To claim the virus doesn’t exist is to damage the anti-lockdown movement by making it look stupid, which in turn assists the doomers and their narrative.</p>

<p>This is the point. They aren't claiming that it is an actual flu virus -- they are pointing out that almost ALL (not just "a lot") of flu cases are being called coronavirus.</p>
<p>That's what happens when medical facilities get tens of thousands of dollars incentive for "covid" diagnoses/hospitalizations.</p>

<p>Just give me a link to their site that reflects the figures in ops pic. If it exists, it's not unreasonable to ask that it is posted here.</p>

        <p>Ok -- so in that case, I'd point out that it's also much more contagious and dangerous to get than the flu. Just because they are both respiratory viruses doesn't mean it's a good idea to insist they're the same.</p>

        <p>I'm not insisting they're the same. Do you think covid is so many magnitudes more contagious than the flu, despite them having very similar symptoms, that it makes sense that covid cases are so high while flu cases are an impossibly small number when compared to the usual # of flu cases? Like the flu could be gotten rid of so effectively, even with loads of people not abiding by cdc guidelines? Wouldn't it be the simplest explanation for at least some covid cases to be misidentified flu cases? I don't think it's impossible covid is that many times more contagious than the flu, and that the flu just really must not be very contagious at all, but it doesn't seem more likely than errors in counting or mistaken identification.</p>

<p>That's fine, but the OP is, in the title of this post.</p>
<p>&rt;Wouldn't it be the simplest explanation for at least some covid cases to be misidentified flu cases?</p>
<p>This is very unlikely because most COVID cases have been identified by <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/RT_PCR_Model.jpg">rtPCR</a> since this test became widely available, which was now more than a year ago. rtPCR only detects strands of RNA exactly matching the known sequence of the SARS-Cov2 virus, and the false positive rate is really quite low. This makes the odds of an influenza case showing up as COVID very low.</p>
<p>I think the most plausible explanation is that the flu is much less contagious than the coronavirus, so measures that <em>kind of</em> work to prevent the spread of COVID work <em>very well</em> to prevent the spread of the flu.</p>

        <p>In all fairness, I have heard Ivor Cummins, a lockdown skeptic/anti NWO/whatever you want to say, say that the flu numbers are down because covid is the dominant virus and it's happened before with other viruses, so the numbers might actually be true, but the crazy conclusion that lockdowns, masks, and social distancing got the flu numbers down is utter nonsense.</p>

<p>I'm sorry: It is uncommonly lethal to those over 50 by the numbers we currently have. Now those numbers are probably inflated by the inaccurate PCR tests but even if they are... 50% wrong... 250K in a year for a flu killing people is a high number.</p>

        <p>This is factually wrong guys. It's absolutely ok to be against the New Normal and at the same time not to post nonsense.</p>
<p>I'm gonna copy from one of my comments to a similiar post:  </p>
<p>&rt;the flu is actually gone because of travel restrictions and natural selection. The flu usually comes from SEA every year so this time this didnt happen and covid was already around. So combine that with covid being the more infectious virus and that's how the flu is gone. Our media seem to be too retarded to understand that. </p>
<p>Baseline is: Covid is not the influenza. <em>But</em> it affects basically the same demographic only in a slightly stronger way.</p>
<p>But it is definetly not the flu, neither virologically nor mechanistically. Covid is more of an endothelitis, so it's different from the pathogenic mechanism of influenza.</p>

        <p>I’m not weighing in on the impact or death rates here. Just stating the fact that it’s a different type of virus strain. The cold is also a different type (of which there are many) strain of a virus. SARS outside of covid has been well documented. Just because symptoms overlap doesnt mean it’s the same thing. Even Anthrax can have similar symptoms.</p>
<p>Again to be clear, I’m not saying whats better or worse or more deadly or human introduced or not blah blah. But it’s physically on a molecular level a different type of virus.</p>

        <p>This is pretty easily explainable. The seasonal flu makes it way around the globe every year starting with Asia. This season, there were already strict travel restrictions in place due to COVID at the time the flu usually makes its rounds so it never made it here in any significant way. You might ask, "Well how come the travel restrictions didn't stop COVID?". This is of course because COVID was already proliferating in the US by the time travel restrictions were put in place so it made little difference. It's also important to understand that not all respiratory viruses are the same. Influenza is MUCH less infectious than COVID, so the social distancing and mask wearing are more effective at halting its spread.</p>
<p>If anyone here actually believes the flu numbers are just being lumped in with the COVID numbers, I can tell you for a fact this is not the case. These numbers are for CONFIRMED cases- meaning these people tested positive for either COVID or flu. These viruses are not similar so you would not test positive for COVID if you have the flu. I understand being skeptical about data, but you have to at least attempt to educate yourself on the subject before making ludicrous claims like this.</p>

        <p>Not one lab culture has been done to prove against influenza or for covid.  Not one.  No proof exists.   </p>
<p>Do you really think 38,000,000 flu cases could have just vanished?  Do you really think labs have performed 38,000,000 cell cultures to prove that very thing?  No.  Not a single cell culture has been done.   The TV man said influenza is gone.  The TV man has no proof.</p>

<p>&rt;What freedoms did you lose?</p>
<p>Me? I never gave any of my freedoms away, my life doesn't matter tho because I already live far away from civilization. You want examples, then check out this sub, it's full of examples of lost freedoms from all around the world.</p>
<p>&rt;It is more dangerous.</p>
<p>Nope</p>

<p>Nope</p>
<p>&rt;and it’s more contagious.</p>
<p>Perhaps</p>
<p>&rt;You literally even admitted that it was more contagious that alone makes it more dangerous?</p>
<p>50% of the population in my country gets the flu every year, nobody cares and thousands of people dies. For reference the total death toll every year is 90 000, and flu/covid deaths are just 2% of that. So no, it's not more dangerous. We didn't even lock down.</p>
<p>&rt;You’ve got to be messing with me right?</p>
<p>Nope, I just genuinely hate tyrants and bureaucrats. All the damn taxes, but what the hell do I get for the money, nothing.</p>

There's no way you're going to get me to believe that better compliance would have made any difference (because perfect compliance is impossible) if the measures are this effective at cutting the flu.

        <p>I don’t know the exact figure but yes. Each person carrying covid is contagious for much longer than with the flu. You can have no symptoms with covid and still be contagious. Why is it so hard to believe that covid is more contagious than the flu? </p>
<p>Also if you look at other countries you can fairly definitively say that it people adhered to the measures it wouldn’t have been as bad. Look at thailand population of about 70m they had under 100 deaths. The only thing they did different was everyone wore a mask without crying about it, and when they started getting surges the stayed at home instead of going to the store and throwing a fit about a mask being against the constitution.</p>

        <p>Why I find it hard to believe is because COVID wouldn't need to be a little more contagious, it would have to be hugely more contagious, I'd have to believe that compliance was enough to completely wipe out the flu, yet not was largely ineffective against COVID 19.</p>
<p>If I accept that I also need to accept that we could do much better than nearly wiping out the flu, which I find hard to believe. </p>
<p>Compliance was so good that there were almost no flu cases and we expect better than that? That sounds unrealistic to me.</p>
<p>I'm not necessarily saying that the flu cases are being relabeled as COVID 19 cases, but to say that COVID 19 cases are high because of poor compliance doesn't make sense if flu cases seem to suggest that there was good (I'd say exceptional) compliance.</p>

        <p>I'm sure they'd help, definitely... But the problem lies in that we've somehow practically eradicated the flu in one flu season with the same measures they're saying no one is taking therefore COVID is still here.</p>

        <p>No at all. The best way to answer this is that covid is more contagious than the flu. It can also be spread by people who don’t have symptoms. The answer to why covid was still a problem is incredibly simple, while the reasoning behind why it wasn’t requires worldwide conspiracy level doublethink.</p>

        <p>First of all without any mitigation even the trump administration said it would’ve been a lot worse. We’re not debating that fact right?</p>
<p>Also for the rest we’re still here because half the country is still refusing to wear masks, is refusing the vaccine, is pretending it’s fake and going about their business as normal. Have you not been paying attention? I mean we’re taking about this in a group literally dedicated to pretending covid isn’t real. Is it really that hard to understand? Look at thailand population of about 70m under 100 deaths. They wear masks, and mandate quarantine. America is not a world leader in anything but ignorance.</p>

        <p>You're "literally" in a sub against lockdowns and masks, not pretending the virus is fake for starters.
America is a shitshow just in general with partisan politics on every aspect of life. Some states are doing it right, but for the most part americans are just the loudest because the usa really did not have anything too strict.
In my country, we have had the strictest lockdowns in europe, the majority wear masks and follow guidelines. Nothing is different.
The flu season of 2018 numbers are worse than this "pandemic".
There's a virus. We have over a year of stats on it. It's not that deadly.</p>

        <p>It doesnt. The last 3 years we've seen a 0.440% increase in worldwide deaths so pre covid we were seeing a slight increase. Overall tho, death tolls worldwide have been shrinking drastically since the 50s. Keep in mind with an increase in population of 1.1% yearly, an increase in deaths per year is to be expected

<p>It's deadlier, and it's a lot more contagious, it transmits over the air easier, people who get sick with it get sick for longer and are contagious for longer, and it took a full year before vaccines for it we're ready while vaccines for the flu are being produced every year for new variants based on the best guesses of what variant may be most prevalent.</p>

        <p>In the past year, the following people that my family knew have died of complications due to covid:</p>
<ul>
<li>two of my significant others childhood friends</li>
<li>my brother's secretary's mother</li>
<li>my bosses sibling</li>
<li>my friend's grandparent</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't recall if I've ever heard of anyone I knew of dying of the flu, though I don't doubt that it is also deadly.</p>
<p>Covid is more deadly than the flu, both from my own personal anecdote and also from the larger data. If you want to claim that both are false I can't stop you, but I feel that you are mistaken on this particular point.</p>
<p>When my brother explained how his secretary was completely heartbroken about how there could not be a funeral how she could not be in the room, it broke my heart too. You might suggest that the solution is that we should lift all restrictions to avoid the heartache of not being able to grieve, but that is so short-sighted. More people will die.</p>
<p>The true solution is to save lives so that you don't need to grieve in the first place, and prevent the disease through mass vaccination and eventual herd immunity. Anything less is stupidity.</p>

        <p>I need to ask, and I hope you did not, but did you support the Black Lives Matter protesting during the height of the pandemic? Or do you acknowledge that it was reckless violation of protocols? A lot of ppl who are pro lockdowns still somehow support this and deny it was a bad thing for containment.</p>

        <p>You are arguing in bad faith.</p>
<p>Of course the protests didn't help the pandemic, though most protesters were masked and outdoors and spaced out. </p>
<p>Rates of infection between protesters were considerably less than rates of infection of people who, for example, went to a casino, maskless, in the same time frame.</p>
<p>Community organizers of the protests knew that the pandemic is a serious problem, on top of the other serious problems they face. The communication was clear, wear a mask, get tested, and if you're sick self-isolate.</p>

        <p>Because it's idiotic to assume such measures would eradicate (reduce by an amount that's basically statistically impossible) the flu in one flu season but also claim the reason covid is around is bc people aren't following those measures</p>

        <p>That is a ridiculous things to say. The amount by which the flu was reduced is insane, if such measures reduced it by 99+% to the point where it's nearly eradicated, how would covid still be an issue? And if there's so many people out there not wearing masks or social distancing, how in the world was the flu gotten rid of almost entirely?</p>
