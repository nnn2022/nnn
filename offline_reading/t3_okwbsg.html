        <p>He's in British Columbia - they just had a horrible heat wave, followed by devastating wild fires. The government is saying something like 900 people died from the heat wave, which is an out of control and absurd number. This just DOES NOT HAPPEN in a first world nation. The whispers on the ground are that the majority of the dead had recently been vaccinated, who are now the victims of a heat wave instead of a vaccine.</p>

Go to Richmond or Vancouver proper you're basically in communist China. Go to Surrey you're basically in Mumbai.<br>
We just had gang warlords shooting up each other all over Lower Brainland. Hell they even assassinated someone at the airport.</p>

        <p>It actually makes a lot of sense, because the heat could certainly put additional stress on your cardiovascular system from constantly sweating. I agree that those numbers are insane and hard to explain even with the '100 year heat records' and 'poor living conditions' narrative.</p>

        <p>This doc is a hero...nowadays if a doctor comes out publicly trying to save life's they'll recieve a gag order.</p>
<p>After he had administered about 900 doses of the Moderna experimental mRNA COVID-19 injections, he sounded the alarm over the severe reactions he was observing in his patients who chose to get the shot (he chose NOT to get it himself), which included death.
The result of him sounding the alarm was a gag order issued against him by the medical authorities in his community. He defied this gag order and was interviewed by Laura-Lynn Tyler Thompson on her show where he sounded the alarm. See:</p>

        <p>As a doc, I have two thoughts: 1) either this is a partially looney doc that is just smart (but still looney) so he can make a convincing argument about anything or 2) he's like a lot of small community docs I know who kind of do everything and know a little bit about everything and have the ability to just do their own small informal scientific study.  </p>
<p>Personally, I don't doubt what he is saying is true.  I can't explain the weird assortment of symptoms that I have seen people get post vaccine any other way.  With that said, in most cases, everything I have seen has eventually gotten better.  But, this will become much more apparent when people are on their 5th booster shot.   Everything he said in terms of the cellular changes is true.  And we know that spike proteins cause endothelial damage.  And while it's not the same as the getting an actual Covid infection, it is still damaging to cell membranes and should cause some damage.  This is why the risk/benefit has to be considered carefully.  Because the risk of the vaccine is likely uniform (or will be reported as uniform).  1:200,000 for this, 1:1,000,000 for that, etc, across all age groups.  But the risk associated with an actual c-19 infection goes down the younger you are.  Not that any of the militant herd vaxxers want to hear this, but that's what risk benefit analysis is all about.</p>

        <p>Well, what he's saying is that spike proteins produced by the vaccines produce micro-clotting on  large scale, which will produce mild, diffuse tissue damage - and in some cases (brain and heart) that damage is irreparable.  And that the evidence for that is the increase in D-Dimer, which results from clotting.  The stuff about pulmonary hypertension is theoretical at this point.</p>

        <p>&rt; Using this test with his own patients, Dr. Hoffe claims that he has found evidence of small blood clots in 62% of his patients who have been injected with an mRNA shot.</p>
<p>&rt; He states that these people are now permanently disabled, and they will no longer “be able to do what they used to do.”</p>
<p>this is how they will get the masses on UBI or some other permanent welfare system. the NWO want all peoples to be dependent on the world government for everything. what better way to do that than to give 62% of the world's population crippling life-long disablements.</p>
