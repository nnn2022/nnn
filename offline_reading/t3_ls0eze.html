        <p>I suppose that this would depend on how we define the terms "believe", "COVID" and "real".</p>
<p>I'd say that reality is the physical world surrounding us, which exists independently from our perception and perspective before we "filter" it through our senses and the processing of our brain.</p>
<p>I think that our perception of reality is just an reflection or a model of reality and as such determined to be flawed.</p>
<p>I think we can get this internal model of reality closer to reality by increasing the amount of perspectives that we look at it.</p>
<p>I'd define believing in something as assuming that the internal model of it does not have any significant flaws and could easily be defended against my own inquiry without getting entrapped in contradictions.</p>
<p>Now let's have a look at how I have perceived covid so far and whether the way I've perceived it is enough for me to have formed a model of it in my mind of which I think reflects it's actual nature that is so accurate, that I'd feel confident to identify it, whenever I encounter it.</p>
<p>All information I've obtained about covid so far is from external sources. It supposedly is a specific type of ailment of the respiratory tract with varying severity. It supposedly is caused by a specific type of virus that is labeled as coronavirus.<br>
Furthermore I've heard that no severity at all, also known as asymptomatic covid-case, should also be possible as long as reproductive coronaviruses are present.<br>
So according to what I've heard, covid could be with everyone and noone and anything inbetween.<br>
And since the supposed size of supposed viruses undercuts my threshold for visual perception, let alone identification, I have no way of personally confirming whether a supposed asymptomatic covid-case is covid or not.</p>
<p>So all I really have is the word of other people who claim that they have methods to detect the virus and who claim that they know the virus can reproduce and who claim that in cases, where covid is not symptom-free but comes with an ailment of the respiratory tract, the viruses are the cause of it.</p>
<p>According to my definition of what is necessary for me to believe in something, covid fails this assessment.<br>
I take it into consideration as one of many possible theories to explain a phenomenon that I have observed.</p>
<p>The main thing that is missing for me to believe in it would be learning about a method that I can personally use in order to confirm the many premises I've heard about the entity called corona-virus.</p>
