    <strong>Bill Spadea on NJ 101.5</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all, I’m new to this sub and glad I found it. It gives me hope that not everyone is giving into this feardemic we are living in. One person who has since day been against closures, lockdowns vaccines, masks, passports etc is Bill Spadea on NJ 101.5 FM. He has a 6am-10am talk show on a radio station that is broadcasted throughout much of New Jersey. Every show since day one last March he slams Governor Phil Murphy, the fear tactics used by the media and government, and the authoritarian measures that are occurring in an attempt to “control the virus”. He gets a lot off flack for what he says and sometimes he goes off the cuff but more times than often he proves his point right. He also touches on other conservative issues too like crime, immigration etc. he also advocates for struggling small businesses and a full reopening of the state with no restrictions. With some of the stuff he says and the way things are today with canceling conservative voices and cancel culture I’m shocked he is still allowed to be on air. </p>
<p>I’ll link his twitter and URL to a webpage of his radio show to which you can listen to online. The only problem I have is the ratio of talk time to commercials/traffic &amp; weather is not ideal but I guess that’s the drawback of FM talk radio. </p>
<p>Keep up the good work of fighting against the fear, even if it seems like an uphill battle.</p>

        <p>I used to listen when I lived in the area and had an hour drive into work. It felt good hearing someone with the same opinions on Covid back when this all started. Couldn't listen to the guys on the way home though, felt the station got more pro-Covid as the day went on.</p>
