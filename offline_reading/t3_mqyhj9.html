    <strong>Society's response can be described as the Five Stages Of Grief</strong>
    <p><p>I started this as a reply for another thread, then decided to post it on its own as food for thought.</p>
<p>Society's reaction to the pandemic can be described as this: <strong>We must go through the five stages of grief to realize that Covid will always exist.</strong></p>
<p>It goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Denial.</strong>  <em>"Two weeks of lockdowns!"  "Ban travel to stop it at the border!"</em>  All futile and doomed, of course, but the only thing we could perceive was trying to deny what was going to inevitably happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anger.</strong>  <em>"Mask up you granny-killer!"  "How dare you refuse the vaccine!"</em>  We're all familiar with this one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bargaining.</strong>  <em>"Sign up for this vaccine passport and we might give you back a crumb of freedom!"</em>  We are here now.  The end of this step is coming as we're seeing that people are refusing the vaxports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Depression.</strong>  <em>"What's the point if we still can catch and spread it?"</em>  We're currently moving into this step.  This will be the theme of the upcoming summer, as we realize that cases will never go to anywhere near zero even with the vaccines, and governments drag out the lockdowns forever waiting for that which will never happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acceptance.</strong>  <em>"We have to learn to live with Covid."</em>  The endgame could go in one of two ways.  Either we actually drop the case-counting fanaticism and actually go back to normal, as happened with the first SARS and the other flu pandemics.  Or acceptance will mean acceptance of the permanent biosecurity enforcement state, masks and symptom questionnaires and temperature checks and the other garbage for every activity for the rest of human society.  This is what the reverse-doomers have been warning about, and this is where we're going to be stuck as long as the fear-machine news media keeps controlling policy and thought.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, many individuals are still stuck in the first two stages, though mostly society is finally past that now.  It will still take quite a while longer to get through the remaining stages, and we'll see what the final "acceptance" actually ends up being.</p></p>

        <p>This checks out.  I am hoping if I can get through the bargaining phase with the people I know, that they will leave me be once they are in Depression.</p>

        <p>This sounds pretty accurate. I just hope once we get to the “acceptance” stage we actually go back to normal; but seeing how powerful the media is in shaping the opinion of sheep, I don’t see it happening.</p>

        <p>I hate this but I know it’s 100% legit. I’m just horrified to see what it is I end up accepting.</p>

        <p>Florida and Texas have entered acceptance for just living with it. I suppose it could be health the country with passports and half not. I suspect that half without is about to get very crowded now the people in blue states are working remote.</p>
