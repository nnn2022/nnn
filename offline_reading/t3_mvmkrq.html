        <p>Honestly the whole neoconservative anti-lockdown movement (Rebel media, Trump people, Fox News, even Ron DeSantis) is extremely sus.</p>
<p>Here's the Neocon logic: they want a police state for immigrants but not for citizens. They fanatically support Israel where vaccine passports are already in force, but they supposedly oppose vaccine passports here. They bAcK tHe bLuE even while these thugs are enforcing the covid regime. In short, they're tards, and none of their positions are consistent or make any sense.</p>
<p>If we're going to defeat the fascist NewNormal, we need a non-partisan coalition that's based in logic and a sense of fair play. The Neocons have already shown their cards and they need to take a seat while non-insane people deal with the situation.</p>

        <p>He is famous for being the face of a man who is trying to fly on planes without a mask and getting past quarantine. </p>
<p>When normies and law enforcement think of “anti-masker flying on a plane” they think of this tatoo’ed up roid junkie. </p>
<p>“
Saccoccia is the son of Art Saccoccia, a successful developer in the Greater Toronto Area. According to his LinkedIn profile, he is the VP for his father’s company Skyhomes. VICE News reached out to Skyhomes for comment and clarification of Saccoccia's role but didn’t hear back.”</p>
<p>Sky homes is a huge developer in Ontario and the family is probably worth North of $100M especially with the insane real estate boom. </p>
<p>Don’t fall for supporting guys like him. </p>

        <p>It’s about priming the image of a typical “anti-masker” and the typical man/woman who stands  up for their rights. </p>
<p>I haven’t worn a mask since the beginning and when I visit stores and use transit I am polite and courteous, not making a big deal about it. It’s not about my ego nor my image. I am trying to normalize what someone who doesn’t wear a mask looks like, just a normal man going about his business. </p>
<p>If I were to fly (which I will need to in the summer) I am afraid that I will be thrown into the same lot as this idiot. I know I have been called a “Trumper” and “Anti-masker” with derision because it is human nature to ascribe the behaviours of prominent individuals to the tribe they belong to. And then lump anyone with similar behaviour into said tribe. </p>
<p>Also look at his behaviour. He’s a multi multi millionaire yet is crowdsourcing this so called campaign. </p>
<p>I do like that he is loud and obnoxious sometimes when he is receiving terrible treatment from employees of airlines or cops. But I feel that there is a way better way of going about it (I know cause I’ve done it everywhere else)</p>
<p>And to be put on a no fly list only adds to his character and marketing appeal. Of course a no fly list doesn’t effect him as he can fly private. </p>
<p>He pretends to be a normal Canadian yet is a heroin loving attention seeking rich kid.</p>

        <p>Okay so I get what you're saying in a way but there's something about it that I think is a core problem with us Canadians. We see people enacting the change we want to see in the world but then criticize the methods or optics of it and dismiss the merit of the action. We vilify Americans for their loudness and excess and hubris but then fail to recognize... it works for them. Also your obsession with his wealth rubs me the wrong way.</p>
<p>I think you should reconsider how important the optics are. His reach has emboldened a lot of people. My wife and I made fun of his appearance and demeanor when we first saw him, but ultimately had to realize... he's doing a better job at this than us even if we wouldn't like ourselves if we behaved the same way. </p>
<p>Also I'm not trying to pick a fight with you, I see your points and agree with them, minus the money thing. I just think if we're gonna beat this thing we gotta unite and look past some of the noise and remember that this is just about getting freedom back, not about how it looks.</p>
