        <p>You might dismiss me as a shill for Big Monk, but depending how hardcore you want to be monasteries are still a thing.</p>

        <p>First off, that sub looks interesting and maybe not full of sheep?
Second, I have a real phobia of phones. For the last 2 years I rarely bothered turning mine on. If you're travelling, it's difficult these days because airlines want to text you and hotels ask for your number but it's not impossible. You can just show up somewhere and walk around looking for a room like I used to, just a few years ago. Someone told me that rooms are always cheaper if you do that too. I grew up in the era when nobody had a phone and it was great. We'd all say we were going to meet at a festival, then show up and couldn't find each other but we'd make new friends instead. The feeling was that you'd meet your friends when you were meant to meet them. Sometimes I wouldn't see my best friends for years. And I honestly preferred that way of life.
I haven't scanned any of those things which trace my movements and I hope I never do. My plan was to move abroad last year and throw the phone away when I got there. But I'm still stuck here.
The only thing I actually do like about my phone is the camera and the fact that it plays music. 
I'm onboard with changing your life and living healthier and also with the other comment about joining a monastery. There is very little which interests me in this throw away society we live in.</p>
