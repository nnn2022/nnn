    <strong>I manage apartments and tenants are getting sick and dying, but not from covid.</strong>
    <p><p><em>suicide trigger warning</em> I manage an apartment complex with over 100 apartments in a major city. In June we were at full capacity. Now, 25% have vacated from loss of income and have had to move in with their family or friends to avoid eviction. Mental health is obviously plummeting. There have been (that I’ve witnessed) four very serious domestic violence instances that have needed intervention on-site this year (only one in the twelve years prior). One guy, after breaking everything in his girlfriend’s unit, scratched a large word across his forehead but it was bleeding too much to make out what it read. I even found a suicide and I want to unpack some thoughts here. I’ve only had one tenant inform me that he tested positive for the virus and he recovered quickly and is thriving. Actually, I'll bet in a fight to the death among all the other tenants he would be the last man standing. I digress, but it’s the truth. I’m not saying he didn’t spread it if/when he had it but the tenant that hung himself had masks all over his apartment. And gloves. And vitamins. He had his weeks ahead planned out on his calendar. He cared enough to stay home and stay safe - it just killed him. He only made it to April. He will never get a chance to recover from the lockdowns. I’m not sure I’ll ever recover from leaving my young son’s already sad birthday celebration to find my neighbor’s body hanging from his ceiling fan by the neck with a bedsheet. His hands were black, I keep seeing that when I think of him. The real kicker is that this particular tenant was a lead scientist and vaccine developer for over a decade at least. He was a pretty brilliant dude. I can’t get over the irony that lockdown depression likely killed what could have been a human so essential to the government’s number one solution. I've wasted a thousand angry eye-rolls on this pandemic. After seeing what I’ve seen this year, It's more than valid to go against the mainstream covid-narrative. Running with it is just pissing into the wind at this point and knowing that doesn't make me a Trump supporter or a terrorist or a “Karen”. I'm just calling it like I see it and it's not pretty from where I'm standing. It’s OK to have different opinions about lockdowns and schools/businesses opening because we’ve all had different pandemic experiences. How many more tenants will be displaced? How many more will be sent to the hospital by their significant other? How many more dead neighbors will property managers and family members have to find before this bullshit is considered barbaric and blown out of proportion by the majority? My health is not the government’s responsibility. Immune systems fight viruses, not politics. Why don't we put another 300lb model on the cover of cosmo and title it “this is healthy” when it's not? It might as well be a model behind a dumpster, blissfully asleep with a heroin needle hanging out of their arm. At least it’s only cosmo and who believes that garbage anymore aside from the kids when no one is looking and all the unhealthy people to which they cater? Thanks for reading all of this. I needed to get that off my chest and this forum has been a breath of fresh air since I found it last week.</p></p>

        <p>You are missing the important point: the Government is about protecting the ruling elite. Hence the Department of Health is just a bunch of witch doctors doing the rain dance, they call it "public health". So if your disease risks to infect their people, surely, they are going to be very careful. Suicide, on the other hand, does not affect in any way the ruling class.</p>
<p>Don't mix Suicide Prevention, which is the Government's way of telling you are going to die when we tell you, and helping people out of depression.</p>

        <p>Wow, I can't imagine how scary all that must be, please don't kill yourself after witnessing all that, and probably much more to come. This is so sad, I wish I could suggest sending this exact letter to your representitive, but I doubt they will care unfortunatly. There needs to be a way to post this on a larger platform. I'm POSITIVE you are not alone, it would be great if every landlord/management etc. Posted their experiance because this is proof it doesn't help.</p>

        <p>I agree. I have no interest in killing myself. If anything, it made me want to live my life with more purpose &amp; I would guess it made me a better mother &amp; neighbor. Thank you for your kind words.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear what you've been experiencing. I'm not sure it's helpful to assume why that guy killed himself though... could have been lots of things</p>
