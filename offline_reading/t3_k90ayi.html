    <strong>I Feel Like I'm Being Held Hostage</strong>
    <p><p>As the title says, its like an ever present blanket over my head these days, that at any moment everything i care about can be stripped from me in the name of public health. It wasn't so bad a few months ago, I went through a phase in March where I thought oh jeez there might be something to this. But after we got the numbers rolling around in may-june, I kinda snapped to and realized this is a lot of action for so little threat, like setting fire to your house to kill the rats in it.</p>
<p>Lately though, with the election down south going on for literally ages, restrictions being tossed around here and there, talk of mandatory vaccines and restrictions for those who refuse them, the camps being built, and more. I dont feel right. Like a fog has descended over my brain and everything is hazy, like its a struggle to stay sane in a world thats losing its shit over God knows what.</p>
<p>Ive always been an outcast, ive always been very different from your average person and never fit in, but its a rare day im attacked for it. And now that my family has been crawling up my backside, save for my father, its been a bit harder. Especially when some of them go so far as to insinuate that I think the government will put tracking nanobots in the serums or whatever other extreme end of paranoia just to make me seem stupid.</p>
<p>I cant understand how people function like this, just, accepting what they're told. If what they are told is correct I wouldn't blame them, but skepticism is healthy especailly these days with mass media and the internet. But instead im the loon, because I ask questions. Or have doubts, or i take issue with government mandates getting into sectors they have no business in.</p>
<p>Every time a restriction comes down it always feels like a punishment. Like theyre punishing us for not obeying as quickly as they wanted. Like slapping a dog for not coming to you as quickly as you wanted. An abusive relationship with authority, a Stockholm syndrome almost. "Oh, you noticed we made it illegal to sue for health damages? 5 more weeks of covid lockdown. Keep it up mister I can keep doing this."</p>
<p>Idk, need a pressure release, reminds me when I first got into politics... not a healthy world we live in folks.</p></p>

        <p>In political jargon, a useful idiot is a derogatory term for a person perceived as propagandizing for a cause without fully comprehending the cause's goals, and who is cynically used by the cause's leaders.[1][2] The term was originally used during the Cold War to describe non-communists regarded as susceptible to communist propaganda and manipulation.</p>
<p>Read the last sentence. They aren't malicious. They are brain washed. End result is the same, however.</p>

<p>I think it's even worse, they don't care if you comply at all, they still will abuse you harder, and there is no way for you to influence this at all - short of violently resisting, but most likely, that wont happen .</p>

        <p>&rt;  that at any moment everything i care about can be stripped from me in the name of public health.</p>
<p>Yes this is exactly what gets me too. When I was being raised in an abusive home as a child, no one “protected” me. When I risked homelessness, I still had to compete with others for jobs and opportunities, others who were better off than I was and who didnt need the job as desperately, and yet, they didn’t stop competing in order to “protect” me. When I was a sickly asthmatic feverish child, no one wore masks around me or distanced from me, even though I often got violently ill after going to school or places where there were lots of people. I just struggled and lived with it. </p>
<p>My whole life has been such a lonely struggle, barely keeping my head above water, protecting self-destructive people from themselves, and now I need to make more sacrifices for people more than twice my age who have had it better than me the whole time. It’s not right.</p>

        <p>I can certainly sympathize with what what you're going through. First of all that family of yours shouldn't be treating you that way; they should be showing you some more love and understanding, and if that's not possible for them the least they could do is keep their mouths shut and not make fun of you.</p>
<p>Secondly, your description of it as feeling like a punishment is completely right. They are punishing us, punishing us for daring to be free, punishing us for having enough audacity to think we should ever have the slightest hope of leading a fulfilling life. Lockdown is a systematic attempt to murder everything we hoped, dreamed, or cared about. Never let it browbeat you into giving up, and never forget or forgive how we were wronged by these people.</p>
