        <p>Look at how this is laid out, first you see the title : ''Did Pfizer’s Former ‘Chief Scientist’ Say There Was ‘No Need for Vaccines’?" and then their conclusion which is ''mostly false''</p>
<p>But if you check the actual claim it goes like this : '' Michael Yeadon, who wrote that "there is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic," was once Pfizer's chief scientific officer. ''</p>
<p>The claim that they say is mostly false is actually that this guy was one Pfizer's chief scientific officer, but he actually did say what is in the title.</p>

        <p>The claim section describes what people believe, that being that Michael Yeadon said this statement and was the chief scientist at Pfizer. The actuality is he never had any leading role at Pfizer and did not deal with viruses, vaccines or anything in this subject matter.</p>
<p>“Yeadon's title was not "chief scientist of Pfizer," "chief scientific officer of Pfizer," or "vice president of Pfizer." The division he ran had nothing to do with vaccines or infectious disease and at the time of its closure in 2011, was focused on developing compounds that targeted asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.”</p>
