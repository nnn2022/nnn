    <strong>Grieving my hopes for the future.</strong>
    <p><p>I know this is not just me and it's worldwide but I just need to vent.</p>
<p>I feel I am grieving my dreams of travelling the world further, having a child and dealing with possibility of losing my job for refusing vaccination, my boss keeps bringing it up and I feel it will be mandated in my workplace. </p>
<p>It seems like there is nothing to hope for anymore but freedom.</p>
<p>Things are being stripped away from me beyond my control and I'm so angry. I don't want an experimental vaccine when I am in my child bearing years or just at all. I don't trust it or the motive behind it. There is no data on the long term side effects.</p>
<p>All over a virus with a crazy high survival rate. None of this makes sense and I honestly believe this is nothing to do with a virus. Australia is a horrible place to be living now. I used to love this place and now I want to move overseas to escape the dictatorship. The endless propaganda on the TV, radio is depressing. It's all about 'cases' and telling people to get vaccinated. There seems to be no other news anymore. People who go against the narrative get censored. What about mental health, suicide, diabetes, heart disease? I just want to scream. </p>
<p>The QR codes to check in everywhere you go is next level control and I don't believe it will go away. It makes me not want to go anywhere. I used to go to shopping centres and look around sometimes. Checking in to every shop you walk into is not my idea of fun and if you don't then someone give you a dirty look. I see people just willingly do this everywhere like it's a game. Children will grow up thinking this is normal!?</p>
<p>I'm just worried for the future. I don't know the point of this but this thread is great and makes me feel like I'm not alone.</p>
<p>What are you grieving?</p></p>

        <p>We all feel the same way. This is by design. Trying to isolate you and make you feel alone... you are not alone go look at videos of any of the massive protests.. and for every single one there are there are way more that cant come to protest...</p>
<p>Their game is almost up, you can see the desperation in their propaganda.. there is indeed something big coming and there seems to be a time limit.</p>
<p>Hold the line, make them accountable.</p>
<p>Your office wants you to vaccinate, ask them who will have liability if you get sick from the vax. In the states that a massive deal. Find one of the many ~docs~ pdfs online that pass liability for anythign that happens to you to your employer/the  person demanding you get vaxed.. ask them to sign it before you have to take anything.</p>
<p>Fuck em.. they going to fire you anyway, may as well make em bleed shit for a bit right?</p>

        <p>My future. I want to move abroad to study and finally get out of the country I've never felt at home in (France, it's even worse now), but I feel I may be trapped here no matter what happens.</p>

        <p>Same here, in early 2020 my bf and I were in the process of buying a boat to spend 2 years sailing around the world, then come home, settle down and have a baby. We had a very detailed plan. That's all screwed up now and will probably never happen, as neither of us is willing to get the shot. </p>
<p>Even having a kid is up in the air now because I don't trust the medical industry at all anymore and I'd be terrified to put my life in their hands. </p>
<p>I don't honestly know what we'll do. We're looking at starting a small farm now instead of buying a boat, and eventually we'll figure things out, but it really sucks.</p>

        <p>Agreed, I'm grieving for my family, split up by these bullshit restrictions. And pretty much no dreams anymore, time to find new ones and screw the system as much as possible along the way.</p>

        <p>It goose stepped so quickly didnt it. Love you brother, id rather die than take the shot, id rather be homeless than keep my job. The world will have to change, people need to grow up and realise what they are conforming to. And once freedoms are lost you only pay in blood to regain them</p>
