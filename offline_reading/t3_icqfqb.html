        <p>Doesn't this means the "asymptomatic" are probably false positives?</p>
<p>Remember.. the test is just for a few small little mRNA strains. And it may be that tens or hundreds of millions of people have these strains already floating around their body.</p>

        <p>My theory has always been that asymptomatic cases, if they never present symptoms, are most likely false positives.</p>

        <p>It can be sars-cov-2, but the quantity they are detecting are likely invalidated virus and their debris. Like bodies and limbs on the battle field after they were conquered.</p>

        <p>Not necessarily, no. Some will be, but not all will be false positives. That doesn't mean that the presence of small amounts of virus RNA is at all clinically significant though. It also doesn't mean they are actively infected. We don't consider someone without flu symptoms a clinical case.</p>
<p>Up to 50% of influenza infections can be asymptomatic. Around 95% of those infected with poliovirus have zero symptoms. Chicken pox and measles can be asymptomatic. The 200+ viruses that cause the "common cold" can be asymptomatic.</p>
<p>For respiratory viruses it appears asymptomatic transmission is rare. Studies havent actually determined if someone asymptomatic with influenza can truly effectively transmit the virus to infect others.  We know they shed such viruses in reduced numbers for shorter periods of time and this implies the potential to transmit it to close contacts, but whether they are an effective mode of transmission is another question entirely. It would at least require prolonged close contact - someone asymptomatic isn't spreading such viruses to all those around them in public. Not sure why they magically assumed that asymptomatic transmission was our biggest scary threat as if it was the major mode of transmission. Or why they thought it was appropriate to instill a belief and fear that our healthy bodies are killing everyone around us. People are convinced their symptom free bodies are now killing machines, bioweapons.</p>

        <p>While, the paper does talk about the asymptomatic infection rates being very low (which I am not surprised about), I worry this can easily be skewed by those looking for more control.  Remember, this paper was done during mask rules were in place in China and all sorts of other measures that only <em>such</em> a country can do.  I can see one simply arguing that the asymptomatic rates were so low <em>because</em> they were wearing masks and these other public measures were in place (which is not what I personally think could be logically concluded from the paper, but it is indeed something speculated about in the paper).  I quote the paper:</p>
<p><em>"However, the risk for secondary infection via household contact was still highest compared with other contact settings because people spent more time at home, which led to more frequent and longer unprotected exposure than the other contact settings. Another explanation is that mask wearing to prevent infection was mandatory in public settings but not in households during the study period. Thus, effective measures to reduce household transmission and quarantine of household contacts are extremely important. "</em></p>
<p><em>"To control the COVID-19 outbreak, China has implemented a series of measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including case surveillance and reporting, strengthening quarantine at ports of exit and entry, epidemiologic investigation and close contact management, treatment of patients with COVID-19 in designated hospitals, social distancing, mandatory mask wearing in public settings, financial support, and emergency material support (</em><a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-2671#r12-M202671"><em>12</em></a><em>). These measures were mandated during the study period. "</em></p>
<p>Don't look to this paper to be a silver bullet.  In fact, I worry one can look to it to say something very different should they have a mission.  This as much as I'd like for this paper to be as simple as that picture and apply to other scenarios.  While one looks at this and says "hey look asymptomatic spread" really isn't too bad of a rate (which might be true outside of a setting like China, or not wearing masks), another can easily look at this paper and say "hey look with all these measures in place that spread is so low, but look at all these other problems in the homes".</p>
<p>I'm adamantly opposed to mask mandates and forcing stuff on people as a scientist, and am <strong>far</strong> more worried about the faulty prescriptive human decision making than the virus itself; people have been twisting things so much throughout this whole situation (government, the moral busy-bodies, and media especially).  But people need to be careful about putting forward evidence of things like this being exactly the same situation they are in, when they might not apply.  USA, Canada, and other places aren't China (at least hopefully not yet).</p>
<p>There could be a lot of lurking things that this paper does not account for.  Regardless, thank you for sharing.  I'm at least glad more research is being done, though I really wish more institutions and officials took previous or quite current (not saying what they like, such as outlined in this table of papers just from 2020 <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=FC8E52BA636736BB!102998&amp;ithint=file%2cdocx&amp;authkey=!ADxJoWXaUV41YQM">https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=FC8E52BA636736BB!102998&amp;ithint=file%2cdocx&amp;authkey=!ADxJoWXaUV41YQM</a> , others do exist from other years) research more seriously (the kinds that could introduce much debate or discredit many of the things being done, especially if the argument is that "the science (trademark) said so" (which I find highly questionable)).  The primary arguments for removing restrictions don't need to be scientific, if you have civil liberties, they should be protected and the public should be protecting these instead of cowering in fear.  I mean, there are many policies that could be designed to say "do this or do that" but we don't accept those ones, why not here (even if one is giving the devil its due and assuming they were fully correct)?</p>
