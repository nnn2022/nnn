    <strong>OB/GYN suggests my pregnant wife should take the vaccine. WTF.</strong>
    <p><p>My wife is a bit older than the "prime" years (over 40) to give birth to our third baby.  We are vehemently against the vaccine and she doesn't even bring up the topic during her visit.  </p>
<p>The doctor then suggests that she should take it.  She says "i know there are not a lot of studies done on pregnant women but..." - first of all, I haven't found any studies on the vaccine on pregnant women and I do know for a fact that the Pfizer fact sheets explicitly say they don't know the risks to pregnant women because they were not part of the trials. It is frightening that a 'doctor' would advise to take such a risk.</p>
<p>She continues on saying "...I have seen a lot of women who had to give birth early and had complications that were infected previously".  What?!! So a virus can cause complications but an experimental vaccine cannot? Why take the risk!? </p>
<p>A couple of folks have told her to get it since 'the antibodies are passed onto the baby'...where did this come from? I have seen a few stories in MSM, but we all know how reliable MSM and some of these 'doctors' are.</p>
<p>At what point does this craziness end? The sheep are going right off the cliff one by one.</p></p>

        <p>Doctors have been this way since the computerization of medicine. They don't think or do tests themselves anymore. They look at a chart, see numbers, ask medical google what to do, and give you the drugs it tells them to try to change those numbers. </p>
<p>MDs are just glorified body technicians nowadays.</p>

        <p>Yeah you’ve got to go to a functional medicine/integrated/holistic MD to get them to spend any real time or effort making sure you’re healthy. That’s what I’ve done for autoimmune issues and it’s been a bitch paying out of pocket but he’s also spent 5+ hours with me discussing my issues and has done extensive research into issues I raised with him that he wasn’t as familiar with. </p>
<p>I think the problem lies primarily with the insurance industry. If they’re not gonna pay for the doctor to do anything more than drop in for 4.35 minutes to speak with the patient and then prescribe medication, doctors aren’t going to do any more than that. No one wants to hear this but I think going back to the system we had ~50+ years ago where you paid out of pocket for everything except catastrophic injury/disease is the way to go. If the insurance industry only has a say in what’s covered when you’re seriously injured in a car crash (for example) and does not dictate what is covered when you go in complaining of insomnia and unexplained weight gain because you’re paying for it not the insurance co, the doctor (and therefore patient) isn’t hemmed in by the insurance co and patients will stop paying $180 for a visit with a doctor to tell them after 30 seconds of looking at their chart that they’re fine but need anti anxiety medicine to sleep (i.e., those doctors will have to step up their game or charge less). Although I realize there is quite literally no chance we move in that direction, so if possible save up/contribute to an HSA/FSA and go off insurance if necessary!!</p>

        <p>To be fair - that’s pretty much the face for every other trade now. How much do you do if your “own” research in your line of work and how much people just follow orders and do what the company tells them to.
I’m not criticising or course, but this happens everywhere and pretty much every working person works in this circumstances, but somehow believe doctors (or medical field) is any different?</p>

        <p>Right but there's no cultural story about a heroic, independent insurance salesman or HR rep who solves a mystery or saves a life.</p>
<p>We have a cultural story about doctors that just isn't true anymore. Yes, everything has become computerized and thus form-centric and bureaucratic. But we have this cultural notion that doctors specifically are puzzle solvers and independent thinkers. They no longer are.</p>

        <p>&rt; I have seen a lot of women who had to give birth early and had complications that were infected previously</p>
<p>This is code for "I have no data, just anecdotes and confirmation bias."  Tons of people have had covid, most never knew it, most had no complications, and there's no causal link here.</p>
<p>Look up vaccinations and miscarriages, the rates SEEM to be up, most likely just because the vax reaction is so severe the body goes in to protect mode and cancels the pregnancy.  It's a common stress response.</p>
<p>I'd get a new obgyn.  We switched a couple times until we found one we were really happy with, and it makes the entire process more relaxed and comfortable, which is just about THE most important factor.</p>
<p>People seem to think every doctor is up to date on every disease, every medical advancement, every change in "best practices", aware of every debunked medical theory.  In reality, they do their jobs and remember some of what they learned in school.  Some are much better, some are much worse, but most will regurgitate what they think the consensus is and shouldn't be lauded as experts on all forms of medical/biology science.</p>

        <p>Ask them what happened to the Hippocratic oath they swore to uphold, and if they’ll take personal responsibility for any adverse outcome. These jabs are not even out of trials and have never been used on humans before (or so we’ve been told). How in the world can someone supposedly responsible for healthcare, ever advocate these, let alone for a pregnant mother? It’s absolute insanity and I would find a doctor who actually uses their brain instead of just following instructions from their drug suppliers. Also- a breastfeeding mother who got the jab just killed her own 5 month old after breastfeeding them. It’s on a VAERS report- dead the day after mom got the jab. But yes, let’s tell our pregnant patients to go ahead with it!</p>

        <p>Dude. I am pregnant with my first.  I’ve already had to fire two OBs. One for requiring my fiancé to have it (as he is the one coming with me to the appointments) and the second one for suggesting I get it. I am a healthy female who is in her 20s.  I can’t even get good advice on the pregnancy subs because all the women talk about is the damn vaccine. Meanwhile I’m just trying to find recommendations on baby products. Sick upside down world.</p>

        <p>Just tell her you might not be a good fit then because you don’t want to get it. However there is a solution that might work for you since she’s so sure you should get the vaccine:</p>
<p>Tell her you’ll have your lawyers draft up something for her and the hospital to sign (i) making them jointly and severally liable for any injury or adverse effects you suffer from the vaccine (note that in the agreement any symptom or physical manifestation that you experience and that has also been reported to the VAERS database will be deemed, in each case, to be an injury or adverse effect from the vaccine if suffered within 10 years of vaccination (causality would be difficult to establish and she should be amenable to stipulating to this since she’s so sure you’ll be fine anyway)) and (ii) that obligates her and the hospital to indemnify you for any costs and expenses incurred by you in connection with such an injury or adverse effect (including consequential losses like loss of future earnings etc). </p>
<p>Then, watch her squirm.</p>

        <p>I couldn't trust a Dr who said all of that. I had to see mine recently and I was worried. She asked if I had the covid vax. I said No. She said ok. Then she asked about flu vax. I said No, I don't get those. She said ok. Next subject. It was such a relief. I was expecting at least a little coercion.</p>

        <p>Big Pharma pours millions of dollars into medical schools. That’s all they know! How to produce a customer. I suggest getting a midwifery a doula. They actually care about your health and the babies health</p>

        <p>Dude probably had one of those "refresher courses" where he was told he had to give the vaccine to everyone, including pregnant people.</p>
<p>I know someone who's a doctor and had to do one of these courses, they told him that vitamin D3 is useless and does nothing. He healed his aunt with cancer with only vitamin d3, cranberry and vitamin c, when all the docs told her there was no chance to save her.</p>
