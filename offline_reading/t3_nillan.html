    <strong>Does anybody else seem to be shadowbanned from other subs?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m a major sports fan, and post/browse a lot on r/nfl, r/49ers and plenty of other subs to follow up.</p>
<p>But this morning, something is very off. I visit these subs, as well as plenty of other subs I usually browse... and they all say there’s an issue/it won’t load. They literally say “Sorry, please try again later.” This was weird. But even weirder was when I realized there were certain subs where I didn’t have that issue. These included this sub, r/conservative, and r/DeSantis. Virtually every other sub, I can’t load.</p>
<p>Am I going crazy? I’m not even an anti-vaxxer (in fact, I got my first dose of Pfizer yesterday). I just like to browse and see what skeptics are saying, provide my opinions, etc. Once in a blue moon I might share an opinion on another sub, but it’s rare and I keep it very mild/moderate because I know most of Reddit doesn’t want to hear anything remotely to the right.</p>
<p>Yet I now seem to be shadow banned from any sub that isn’t right-leaning. Can anyone else confirm if this is happening to them? This is legit scary. I’m not even sharing my quote-on-quote “garbage, dangerous opinions” on these other subs...</p>
<p>EDIT: Looks like they let me back in. That was bizarre though. I guarantee I was allowed in to the latter two subs I mentioned, but not the former two or any other subs. Checked multiple times. Seems posting this thread did the trick though.</p></p>

        <p>So I hadn’t even thought about it but I am having the same issues. I cannot load my Home feed which consists primarily of sports subs.</p>
