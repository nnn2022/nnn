        <p>Who cares? I’ve accepted my position as a second class, unvaccinated individual of this hellish planet. It’s now up to me to find the most bearable area of the nation-state where I can live my life in peace. This planet is boring as shit anyway, filled with corporate slaves.</p>

        <p>Well said. I’ve long felt exactly what you’re describing. This planet is boring and everyone sucks. </p>
<p>Well before COVID hysteria further ruined everyone’s minds, political correctness and the eagerness to embrace nanny-state legislation was already working overtime. </p>
<p>Work, eat, sleep, repeat. Resist being yourself and always walk their thin line of pre-defined acceptable behaviour. Act how they want, think how they want, talk how they want, and ostracize anyone that doesn’t get in line. </p>
<p>What a great world they’ve built for us to slowly drone away in. I love my children more than my own life but I’m sad that I’ve brought them here.</p>

        <p>Hopes fade for UK-US travel corridor this summer as fears grow that Brits jabbed with AstaZeneca vaccine will be stopped from entering the States
Delta variant and complex US political system cast doubt over the travel corridor
Sources suggested it is very unlikely to be in place this summer as talks continue
AZ vaccine also yet to be approved so could mean recipients barred from entry

Hopes are fading that a travel corridor between the UK and the US will be established this summer.</p>
<p>Doubt has been cast as fears grow that Britons vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine will be barred from entering the States.</p>
<p>It comes as EU countries continue to impose increasingly tough restrictions on Britons travelling to the continent over concerns about the Delta variant. </p>
<p>Officials involved in talks about the potential US UK travel corridor said they thought it was increasingly unlikely they would reach a conclusion by the end of July, the Financial Times reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The officials added that the rise in cases of the Delta variant in the UK and the complexities of the U.S. political system were set to extend the talks into August and even September, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The matter is further complicated by the fact that the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine has yet to be approved in the US.</p>
<p>The possibility of a travel corridor between the UK and the US looks unlikely this summer as concerns over the Delta variant and the unapproved AZ vaccine cast doubt on the matter. Pictured: Travelers wait in line at John F. Kennedy Airport last month in New York City</p>

<p>This could mean that Britons who have been jabbed with the vaccine could be barred from entering the US until it is approved - a process which could take several months.</p>
<p>One UK diplomat told the FT: 'AstraZeneca is proving a real problem. If the US doesn't recognise it, it means millions of Brits won't be eligible to travel if we agree to a new corridor.'

        <p>It would be very interesting if someday they let in unvaccinated people but still banned AZ recipients</p>

        <p>They do let unvaccinated people in. As far as I know. American citizens for sure.</p>
