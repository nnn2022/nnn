    <strong>Because Words Matter: How We Address the Last Year</strong>
    <p><p>There's a danger in referring to days as "pre-Covid" or "post-Covid".  Here's the important thing to remember:</p>
<p>- Covid didn't destroy businesses</p>
<p>- Covid didn't shutter people indoors</p>
<p>- Covid didn't sow distrust within communities</p>
<p>It was bureaucrats reaching for relevance, people with no skills other than pushing a pencil, that brought all of this hell into the world.  The old, thriving society we knew was "pre-lockdown".  The authoritarian cluster which we now inhabit isn't a product of the flu, it's a postmodern coup of our individual liberty and our public health.</p>
<p>SO, if you hear somebody blaming Covid for being unable to make rent, or not being able to see a grandchild, or missing a pleasure as simple as drinks with friends, remind them that Covid isn't to blame.  It's the fault of power-hungry desk jockeys and soulless nobodies resentful that they could never impact real, positive change in the world, so they resorted to meaningless (or worse, harmful) platitudes and decrees in order to receive any kind of attention.</p>
<p>Love y'all.  Give someone a smile today, and let them see it for all of its beauty.</p></p>

        <p>You're absolutely correct. People need to aim their just anger at these conspirators (the WEF, Gates foundation, WHO). Remember that substitute move in Pok√©mon? Well thats all Covid is. Its an intangible stand in scapegoat to take the heat that should be burning these so called elites off the face of the earth.</p>

        <p>I see the momentaneous situation as a " tip of an iceberg " thing ... like ...</p>
<p>because so many human beings have for so long times chosen to go along with hierarchies and representative governements ... so many people have for so long times chosen to empower the medical doctors with their strong connections to the pharmaceutical industry ... to be appreciated by great parts of society as ... the experts ... in all questions of health ...</p>
<p>we arrived at a moment where the dictate of an elected representative politician / governement employe together with the so called "expertise" of a medical schooled person ... corner the individual human being into a situation where freedom to choose what ones wants to eat, drink or otherwise ingest/inject into ones body is being framed as an irresponsible behaviour against ones fellows</p>
<p>the coronavirus never was and never will be the enemy of a free human being who knows how important a positive connection is to all living beings, to be in harmony with the web of life</p>
<p>so how possibly could we who live beside each other as neighbours and most probably have no wish to demand from each other to do anything what goes against our moral values ... how could we get rid of all this superficial hierarchic overhead what is trying at this moment to exercise some dictatorship / tyrant mode ... like a test run ...</p>
<p>as I see it ... what would really help is to deconstruct the empire structure ... to flatten the hierarchy... no actually ... dissolve all hierarchies by decentralising distributing all political powers to the level of the local community</p>
<p>and how could this be done ... possibly via a renewal of regional state constitutions as well as of the nation state constitution ...</p>
<p>possibly using some concepts like:</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</p>

        <p>I believe in the (full) assembly of all children, youth and adult human beings who live here and now, all permanent residents no matter the age no matter their place of birth ... each one having the same weighted political voting power ... all permanent residents being invited to participate in the decision finding of all matters what concern the local community</p>
<p>I believe in the wholesomeness, the deep sustainability of finding a consensus, of listening to everyones concerns and not giving up finding a solution until everyone who lives here and now agrees with it or at least is not objecting it and if that would be too tiresome, too demanding, I guess there could still be a worthwhile attempt in trying to reach at minimum a qualified majority of 60 percent plus for a decision what impacts everyones lives</p>
<p>I do not see anything more ethical more higher in moral value than the circle of equals ... no one dominating an other one ... no adults dominating children ... no people born here dominating people born somewhere else</p>
<p>we all who live here and now permanently, who chose to live here as permanent residents ... coming together to sort it out, to leave no stone uncovered but to search everywhere for the one tiny path what satisfies all of us</p>
<p>to infinity and beyond</p>
<p>together as one</p>
<p>all human beings as part of the one cosmic family of living beings</p>

        <p>every human being has spent 9 months inside its mothers womb ... it has spent this time listening to its mothers heartbeat, her voice and analysing all audio sources reaching it ... as well as experiencing everything what its mother experienced though the shared bloodstream on the deepest level, the biochemical cellular level</p>
<p>the newborn baby is at its peak of spiritual, mental, emotional and physical fitness</p>
<p>it possibly has all the solutions all the cures for all what ails humanity</p>
<p>but because most of human society is following the stupid " I am bigger/older/richer than you thats why I will dominate you just because I can" madness ...</p>
<p>many newborns state of existence deteriorates more or less quickly because its surrounding does not respect the newly arrived soul in a wholesome manner but seeks to vampirize its existence, suck the life out of it and turn a sovereign being into a dependant insecure willing to surrender and become a numb servant</p>
<p>what we experience since about a year now is just the latest attempt of overriding the growing renaissance ... the growing wish of more and more people to change our societal structures towards more fairness not only between us humans but also towards our fellow animals and all wild living ones</p>
<p>the coronavirus as well as all viruses and bacterias are messengers of the web of life, they come to our assistance, they want to live with us, on our skins, in our bodies to help us detect the garbage we have hidden, the stuff we did not bother to clean up, the rejected unsolved baggage we keep on lugging around in our spritual, mental, emotional and yes also physical bodies .... keep locking it into dense clusters of cells what hinder the free flow of joy carrying lifeforce trough our systems</p>
<p>the moment we declare the coronavirus our enemy ... we miss the opportunity to learn from the virus ... the more we use sharp liquids killing all the life on our skins ... the poorer our micro-fauna gets .. the less support we have detecting where all in our organs and joints and bones we have hidden the stuff we were too lazy to look at</p>
<p>seen from my viewpoint ... no human being has any authority to tell an other human being what to eat, drink or otherwise introduce into its body ...</p>
<p>wether or not I want to fear the little microbeings, the bacteria and the virus ... or I choose to see them as my allies, as my little helpers what nature has sent to me to improve my fitness level</p>
<p>my life, my choice</p>

        <p>there are scientists who work to collect informations how beneficial virus are for us</p>
<p>-------------------------------------</p>
<p><a href="https://newatlas.com/science/gut-virome-database-virus-microbiome-phage/">https://newatlas.com/science/gut-virome-database-virus-microbiome-phage/</a></p>
<p>"A general rule of thumb for ecology is that higher diversity leads to a healthier ecosystem," says Gregory. "We know that more diversity of viruses and microbes is usually associated with a healthier individual. And we saw that healthier individuals tend to have a higher diversity of viruses, indicating that these viruses may be potentially doing something positive and having a beneficial role."</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------</p>
<p>i was so happy when I discovered this article some time ago ... since the time when I was a teenager and learned about peter duesberg trying to share with the world his findings that HIV is not the cause for AIDS</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/paper-denying-hiv-aids-link-secures-publication-1.9737">https://www.nature.com/news/paper-denying-hiv-aids-link-secures-publication-1.9737</a></p>
<p>I felt that there is some gigantic corruption ongoing in our human society with the pharmaceutical industry and the medical doctors being in a most unhealty relationship making most everyone suffer from their virus scapegoating politics</p>
<p>the size of the global chemical industry is of such enormity ...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/302081/revenue-of-global-chemical-industry/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/302081/revenue-of-global-chemical-industry/</a></p>
<p>that it does not surprise when in 2020 and 2021 perhaps more than half of humanity is being handled like imbeciles ... most every human being on the planet being forced to wear an air flow limiting face mask, being forced to keep a distance to fellow human beings and most sadly ... being forbidden to move freely outside of ones home, being forbidden to meet others of ones liking</p>
<p>what we are being exercised upon is a show of might ... the centralistic political activists or elected governement representsentants working in concert with</p>
<p>the pharmaceutical industry</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/19/2160795/0/en/Pharmaceutical-Manufacturing-Market-Size-Expected-to-Reach-US-1-173-3-Bn-by-2030.html">https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/19/2160795/0/en/Pharmaceutical-Manufacturing-Market-Size-Expected-to-Reach-US-1-173-3-Bn-by-2030.html</a></p>
<p>to undermine the self-consciousness, the self-worth of most everyone</p>
<p>the goal of this evil plot of world domination by centralistic government initiatives controlling most everyones everyday lives however they wish ... sometimes giving a little more radius on the leash we are kept on ... sometimes tightening up the radius in where we are told we could move within</p>
<p>it is not the first time the chemical industry has tried to position themselves as the saviour ... as humanities only hope against wild nature</p>
<p>its just a bit frustrating for me to see how successful this all works out ...</p>
<p>like how many people seem to believe that their very own body would not be capable of learning from the coronavirus ...</p>
<p>that the coronavirus would be the enemy of humanity</p>
<p>I would not have believed it when someone would have told me in january 2020 that soon the governements all over the planet would exercise emergency laws to forbid people to move freely on the streets, to assemble ... that people would be forced to obstruct their breathing by having to wear a face mask ... that people would be forced to provide their living address when visiting a public restaurant, a dancing club or any other social gatherings, that everyone at all times could be forced by governement threat of violence to test oneself for coronavirus and then being forced into self-quarantine or supervised isolation</p>
<p>i am still having a hard time to mentally process how so quickly the western democracies have turned into dictatorships where so called epidemologists set the pace of opening and closing shops, allowing or forbidding people to move freely, assemble freely</p>
<p>wether or not there is a secret concerted effort of supporters of the chemical and pharmaceutical industry to use the coronavirus as a scapegoat to train people accepting centralistic governement emergency law being used for prolonged times ...</p>
<p>wether or not there is a secret agenda hooking most everyone up to believe in the pharmaceutical industry being the only hope for humanity to ever enjoy free movement and free unobstructed meetings again</p>
<p>wether or not there is a money making motive behind all this or just a plain global dictatorial approach seeking much more than financial profits but finally to make most everyone give up voluntarily their very own freedom to decide what the want to introduce into their bodies and what not</p>
<p>its all much too much for me</p>
<p>but I am not giving up the good cause</p>
<p>I still believe that we human beings wake up from this nightmare and call them out ...</p>
<p>that we refuse to protect ourselves against the coronavirus, <strong>that we refuse to declare the coronavirus our enemy</strong></p>
<p>imagine there is a war and no one volunteers to fight in it</p>
<p><strong>but instead acknowledge all virus and all bacteria for what they really are</strong></p>
<p><strong>messengers of the whole web of life, carriers of important informations ...</strong></p>
<p>coming to see us, coming to live on our skins, live inside our bodies to check us out, see if we have done our maintance jobs on spiritual, mental, emotional and physical cleaning ... or if they can find some deposits we might have overlooked, some trash we were for years shy to touch but have locked it away into dense blocking clusters inside our organs, our joints and bones</p>
