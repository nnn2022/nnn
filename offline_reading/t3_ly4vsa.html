    <strong>Not trying to virtue signal but...</strong>
    <p><p>There was a young homeless girl outside of my apartment tonight who had just got out of jail and needed help. I welcomed her into my home because she needed to use the bathroom. </p>
<p>I called a Lyft for her to get to the women’s shelter. And paid for all of it including the tip which was gratuitous, and I texted the driver an explanation of what was going on. The girl seemed like she might have been high on something but I didn’t care. I just wanted her to be safe and not have to walk miles to get there when it’s dark out. I even gave her a mask because Lyft requires it. BTW I’m a woman, I wasn’t being creepy.</p>
<p>Tell me more about how we are all selfish assholes who lack compassion, doomers.</p></p>
