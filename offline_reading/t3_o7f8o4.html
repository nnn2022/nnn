        <p>Proof from before the propaganda.  Here, is a pertinent quote at the end.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, neither of the two surgical masks tested may be considered sufficiently effective in removing submicrometer-sized aerosol particles. Such airborne pathogens as aerosolized blood-borne pathogens may be in this size range. Perimeter 
leakage further increases the percentage of exter-
nally present aerosols that penetrate to the wear-
er's breathing zone.</p>
<p>Right there says masks don't work for airborne pathogens, like Covid.  I'm sure the doomers will say the info is too old, even though surgical masks are still made the exact same way today.</p>

        <p>Read the study.  One mask allowed 80% of the particles to penetrate regardless of flow.  The mask with a filter allowed 25% penettration at low flow and 70% at high flow.  Sufficiently effective is 95% of particles stopped or 5% penetration.  This is the standard of N95 masks.</p>
<p>This was penetration through the mask material.  There was also particles that escaped around the edges of the mask.</p>

        <p>Sounds pretty conclusive that the masks were more effective than no masks.  Really helps demonstrate why masks are an important part of reducing the spread of COVID. And N95 masks even more so. Thanks for the clarification.</p>

        <p>Actually it shows no significant difference between no mask and masks for protection against airborne pathogens.  It conclusively says the exact opposite of what you're stating. 80% penetration is NOT protecting you.</p>
<p>No wonder you guys blindly believe what you're told by the MSM.  You can't read.</p>

        <p>20% reduction sounds statistically significant. They wouldn’t have reported it if it wasn’t.</p>

        <p>If they don't show a p value and a confidence interval, then you can't make that determination.  Assuming it's significant because they reported it, is foolhardy.  Also, if it was 20% reduction in droplet transmission, it's also meaningless.  Covid transmission is aerosol.  All the pro-mask studies I've seen only claim a reduction in droplets.  Everything on aerosols is indirect assumptions based on air turbulence.</p>

        <p>All the talk about aerosols and penetration is just distraction. Masks don't work because diseases are not caused by communicable germs. Masks have never been shown to even be effective at their original purpose.</p>
<p>&rt;It has never been shown that wearing surgical face masks decreases postoperative wound infections. On the contrary, a 50% decrease has been reported after omitting face masks. The present study was designed to reveal any 30% or greater difference in general surgery wound infection rates by using face masks or not. During 115 weeks, a total of 3,088 patients were included in the study. Weeks were denoted as "masked" or "unmasked" according to a random list. After 1,537 operations performed with face masks, 73 (4.7%) wound infections were recorded and, after 1,551 operations performed without face masks, 55 (3.5%) infections occurred. This difference was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05) and the bacterial species cultured from the wound infections did not differ in any way, which would have supported the fact tha the numerical difference was a statistically "missed" difference. These results indicated that the use of face masks might be reconsidered. Masks may be used to protect the operating team from drops of infected blood and from airborne infections, but have not been proven to protect the patient operated by a healthy operating team.</p>
