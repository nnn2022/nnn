    <strong>The great reset?</strong>
    <p><p>After watching the video in this post:  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oq5j0b/the_great_reset/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oq5j0b/the_great_reset/</a>. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I thought, "wow! That's a big gotcha!". </p>
<p>I had come across references to "the great reset" on this sub and in other places and it immediately projected in my mind the view of an even more dystopian future, fulfilling the conspiracy theories of ridding the world of the useless "bottom feeders" and leaving more of the works to the elites to enjoy for themselves.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The video above mentions a book by Klaus Schwab titled "covid 19 - the great reset". I imagined this to be a proposal for the elites to take advantage of, and exaggerate the effects of the "pandemic". We have definitely seen this exaggeration happening, with inflated covid death numbers, downplayed vaccine adverse reaction numbers, censoring of anyone questioning the narrative, pushing vaccinations for younger and younger people, irrespective of their risk, ever increasing infringements of civil liberties and increasing tyrranical policies, etc...". I don't need to convince you guys, I'm leaving to the choir.   </p>
<p>All the above fits in to the conspiracy theory that the elites want to take more of the world for themselves than they already have and this Schwab guy is one of the members of Carlin's "it's a big club and you're not in it!"</p>
<p>I decided to look into Schwab's message and found this page: <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/">https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/</a> and this </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stakeholder-capitalism-new-metrics-by-klaus-schwab-2019-11">https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stakeholder-capitalism-new-metrics-by-klaus-schwab-2019-11</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is a quote from the second page:   </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"We suld seize this moment to ensure that stakeholder capitalism remains the new dominant model. To that end, the World Economic Forum is releasing a new “Davos Manifesto,” which states that companies should pay their fair share of taxes, show zero tolerance for corruption, uphold human rights throughout their global supply chains, and advocate for a competitive level playing field – particularly in the “platform economy."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Unless this is yet another bait and switch political narrative, I can't honestly fault Schwab's views. At least not the tiny part that I've read of them.  </p>
<p>Wouldn't stakeholder capitalism reverse and solve many of the problems that late stage capitalism and corporatism and wealth concentration have created?  </p>
<p>Edit:
I didn't pay enough attention to this paragraph in my second link:</p>
<p>&rt;But, compared to these two options, the third has the most to recommend it. “Stakeholder capitalism,” a model I first proposed a half-century ago, positions private corporations as trustees of society, and is clearly the best response to today’s social and environmental challenges. </p>
<p>Positioning private corporations as trustees of society. This makes me rethink my original interpretation of Schwab's message.</p></p>

        <p>It depends who the 'stakeholders' are.</p>
<p>Sadly I don't think it includes us.</p>
<p>Stakeholder capitalism is basically a proposal to remove democracy and have decisions made by a small group of state and big business stakeholders instead.</p>

        <p>As I understood it, the stakeholders are all the people and systems (environment) that will be effected by the activity.<br>
In contrast to shareholder capitalism in which the people making the profits are not impacted by the policies of the companies activities.</p>

        <p>It is literally a fancy term for Command Economy.  </p>
<p>The stakeholders are the innumerable associations,  governments, agencies and extraterritorial organizations ( like WHO, UN, Wold Bank etc) that are actually run by by the same corporations </p>
<p>Not a conspiracy. </p>
<p>The recycling companies and Regulators for producer responsibility are owned by Coke and Pepsi  as 1 example.</p>
<p>This is highly centralized Command Economy</p>

        <p>But in reality, the stakeholders will be TPTB and their placemen. Usually in the guise of unaccountable NGOs / quangos etc.
It won't be democratically accountable.</p>

        <p>The fact of the matter is the overwhelming majority of people do not know anything about economics and like to blame their problems on "capitalism" because they're told that's what we have. Capitalism in its truest sense implies a free market economy which we do not have. At best we have a mixed economy,  while some less fortunate countries have a command economy. </p>
<p>In the US we have "crony capitalism" or, as you mentioned, "corporatism", where government intervenes to grant special privileges to the politically connected. "Stakeholder capitalism" is the same thing just with a nicer spin to it. We also have disastrous socialized programs (welfare) running up trillions of debt and trillions in unfunded liabilities with an aggressive military industrial complex running up the bill even more with pointless wars. </p>
<p>What I'm getting at is that none of these economic problems we face are the result of capitalism because capitalism seeks to better society through voluntary exchange of goods and services on the free and open market. Our problems are caused by government intervention in the free market. If this "great reset" needs government intervention to happen we're just going to see more of the same problems we already have while more of the same people continue to benefit.</p>

        <p>Good point.  Can't depend on govt to fix problems created by govt. However,  if more businesses and consumers make an effort to follow stakeholder capitalism wouldn't we start fixing the problem from the outside in?</p>
<p>Another characteristic is add to a description of the current system is privatised profits and socialized losses</p>

<p>The issue with that is "who are the stakeholders?".  Say you have a corner store in a small country community,  with the next closest store a decent distance away. Growing up in the country this was a real thing for me. This store was a fixture in the community, we loved it. We, as members of this community and patrons of the store, can make the argument that we have a stake in this store. Now, what happens when this store for whatever reason starts to go under and shut down?  As stakeholders we don't want this. What happens?  Maybe the community comes together to bail them out...but what if it's not enough?  </p>
<p>Stakeholders is a very broad term and can be applied to anyone in any situation. That means it's up to interpretation,  and who will be doing that interpretation?  Furthermore as in the scenario I laid out what happens when stakeholders are negatively affected and outside  intervention is the only "fix"?  Who does the intervening?  Or should the business be allowed to close, in which case the stakeholders are worse off?</p>

        <p>Lol,wow! Might be controversial and a long-shot in this case but shouldn't we try to avoid letting a person's personal choices cloud our judgement of their professional aphilosophies? I agree that ait might be difficult in this case it the same could have been said about a person's sexual preferences a few years ago.</p>

        <p>I hear you, but I feel that sometimes there is a million mile divide between the sexual preferences of a youthful person and a man well into his 60s. One is healthy, no matter what persuasion and the other appears to be the product of a psyche twisted by power and authority.</p>
