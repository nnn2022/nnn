        <p>I wish more of this stuff got out to the general public, I've seen reports of at least three people that are actors and they've appeared in interviews talking about how they have nearly died from covid and everybody needs to take the vaccine. It was all propaganda. People saw their profiles online and they are all professional actors. They're not being presented as actors though. This is all bullshit. So many people are unaware of this manipulation.</p>

        <p>It surprises me that no one has made the connection between the way the public is addressed and the way an abusive partner speaks to their spouse. They don’t take responsibility for their actions, that they are entirely free to not do, such as locking down. Instead they essentially say, “look what you made me do”. It makes me feel sick.</p>

        <p>Frontline heroes my fucking arse, I have friends in NHS and was working there myself before this shitshow. Majority of nurses and doctors don't give a fuck, or healthcare workers, especially you fucking green ignorant student doctors don't even know how to say good morning to you.</p>
<p>"Alright darling here is paracetamol for you" that's how they care about, chatting and laughing not taking things seriously at all. </p>
<p>There are far more severe things than covid, the other day my friend told me guy was on the floor in the puddle of own blood, they weren't in rush to do anything at all, patients are not better anyway they treat you like a servant and demand everything, they treat hospital like a free fucking hotel service or care home.</p>
<p>PS. Ohhh and praise NHS cult is even worse</p>

        <p>Ask young people in public if they want to be locked down </p>
<p>80% that I speak to are massively against it. </p>
<p>Older people aren't for it but don't seem to find as much.</p>
<p>Very few people are for it. </p>
<p>I speak to hundreds of people every day for my job and that's what I'm basing this off. </p>
<p>All this noise about more restrictions is the far left wing laptop class that is very loud on the internet and is somehow the entire target audience of these yougov polls.</p>
