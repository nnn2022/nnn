    <strong>NoNewNormal for Newcomers</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone. This sub has been getting a lot of attention lately and there has been a LOT of misinformation about it outside of it. Many people come here having already formed their opinion of what we are all like before reading any posts. What I ask is that if you can read at least one post before forming a judgment, make it this one.</p>
<p>NoNewNormal is not an echo chamber. We welcome discussion and while you might be downvoted, you will never be banned for "misinformation". You will only be banned if you call for someone's death or celebrate it. This sub has differing and not unified opinions on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Masks: useful and only a minor inconvenience? Useless? Actively harmful? Useful but a sign of compliance?</li>
<li>Vaccines: safe and our only ticket out of this hell? Rushed and dangerous? Should or shouldn't be mandatory?</li>
<li>Politics: Certainly there are a lot of rightists here, but they by no means are the only ones. Lockdowns hurt minorities disproportionately. Lockdowns have led to a massive increase in inequality. Lockdowns are especially deadly in the third world. There are a lot of reasons for leftists to be anti-lockdown </li>
<li>Covid itself: Deadly and dangerous? A minor threat that is overblown? How trust-worthy are the official numbers?</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that "when you cut out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you are only proving that you fear what he has to say". This and similar subs are the only places on reddit where discussion about the above topics is even allowed. We believe that a fair and open discussion will always lead to the truth better than a censored narrative. For this discussion to happen, we need people from both sides. We need you as well. As long as joy are respectful, I have found this sub extremely open to well-intentioned debate.</p>
<p>So if we are not specifically in agreement about any of the above points, what is it exactly that unites us? What is our driving purpose? The only belief we all share is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lockdowns do massively more harm than good.</li>
</ul>
<p>No, we're not talking about "oh we want haircuts" or "oh we want to go on a ski vacation". We are talking about record numbers of unemployment, drug addiction, suicides, domestic violence, delayed cancer screenings, in some cases famine. </p>
<p>For a wealthy, happy family where at least some members work remotely, lockdown might mean a missed vacation or two. If you're in that situation, of course it's no big deal.</p>
<p>For some people I know (poorer background) who used to live on one meal a day, lockdown has robbed them of even that.</p>
<p>For people who live alone and suffer from mental illness, lockdown has isolated them from their entire support system. (Suicides in many places have more than doubled)</p>
<p>People have been trapped at home with domestic abusers. Healthy 20 year olds have died of cancer due to delayed screenings. Children have lost access to education which directly correlates with a decrease of life expectancy. And everyone has been encouraged to live a less healthy, sedentary lifestyle.</p>
<p>It's very easy to see the immediate effects of covid now. The numbers are constantly thrown in your face. But how do you see the effects of lockdown? How do you quantify such effects, some of which will still be with us decades from now? No one reports on it, or if they do, they blame it on covid. I've heard so many people say things like "covid ruined my senior year of university". No, covid didn't. Lockdowns did. Until we separate the actors and consequences, how can we have an open discussion about which is worse, the cure or the disease?</p>
<p>Ultimately we believe that we have no right to throw other people under the bus and sacrifice their lives just to protect us or our families. If you want to wear a mask, if you want to get the vaccine, if you want to find a remote working job, no one here will blame you. But to order 7 billion people to do the same you better have scientific backing that your stance decreases death and suffering. I have not seen even one study compare the effects of lockdown to covid to decide which is there. The evidence is simply not there.</p>
<p>Edit: oh by the way, let me give you a quick tour of anti-lockdown subs. While all are somewhat united in our main beliefs, some places are better for discussion than others.</p>
<p>r/LockdownSkepticism - in my opinion the best place for discussion and open questions. Very level-headed, very rational discussions, sources are always required for extraordinary claims. Highly recommend.</p>
<p>r/NoNewNormal - that's us! A bit more extreme, more of a ranty nature. You can still discuss here as explained in the post. But don't be surprised if people are more frustrated </p>
<p>r/CoronavirusCirclejerk and r/ChurchOfCovid - go there for a laugh. They exist for memes, not really to discuss. Imo church is way funnier, but you do you</p></p>

        <p>I agree with your sentiment... but, to say that people shouldn't call names, and then call them names (shills) doesn't really start the conversation off on the right foot, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I mean, you could argue that by definition that's what they are... but it could still be seen as name calling. Just like how calling someone an asshole is, even if they <em>are</em> being an asshole. At least that's my opinion on name calling.</p>

        <p>I mean, there is "continuously" before namecalling for a reason. So I didn't say that people should not call names at all, but rather namecalling everyone at first chance for whatever different opinion they may have.</p>
<p>While true that shill may be namecalling, I thought it was the most informative and respectful word I could come up with to define a group of people that follow a set of actions. However, I didn't directly involve any user with this group of people.</p>
<p>I myself have done it sometimes, but only after being insulted and namecalled several times while trying to have a civil dialogue.</p>

<p>In my home country last week after they renewed the lockdown a man burned himself rather than face a reality where he can't feed his children. He literally set himself on fire. It was all over the news.</p>
<p>Tell me again how lockdown skepticism is a first world problem.</p>
<p>And we ARE working on hunger. By demanding to open the world back up. Once people can work to feed their families, deaths will go down. It would take being a massively privileged first world citizen to be sheltered from that fact</p>

        <p>We've been having a lot of political posts since some of the conservative subs were banned.  I think we should try to avoid watering down the focus of this forum by keeping politics out of it unless a specific politician is under examination for something they're doing to promote New Normal behavior.</p>

        <p>I have to agree.  Besides, I get the sense that there is no Red v. Blue as far as the politicians go - they're all on the same team to enrich themselves by helping corporations and the elite plunder America.  They try to keep us fighting amongst ourselves instead of directing our energy towards stopping them.</p>

        <p>I'll say this. I personally disagree that the lockdowns clearly do more harm than Covid is doing, or would do without a lockdown, but of course there's no denying that the lockdown  has it's bad consequences as well, and for some people, of course the lockdown consequences are worse than the virus.</p>
<p>So if this subreddit is open for different viewpoints, then that's of course good, although not every post seems to reflect that. As long as people don't deny the virus or other facts, I do at least understand why people argue against the lockdown, even if I disagree.</p>

        <p>Too many people where I live are losing everything they own and have worked for.  Can I take everything you own, all the $$ in your bank, and give it to them, since you're so in favor of forcing this on them?  It's only fair.</p>
<p>These lockdowns are a form of legal plunder.  They're ethically abominable.  Let people accept whatever risk they're comfortable with.  If covid is as horrible as you think, people will self-regulate on the individual level.  Otherwise you're just engaging in false philanthropy and greed.</p>

        <p>See, the difference between your reply and the other one I got is that the other person can actually respond to me in a respectful way despite not agreeing with me. Meanwhile you are getting offensive immediately. </p>
<p>And I am not in favor of taking everything that some people own away. That's a beyond ridiculous accusation. It's about picking the lesser evil. And I completely understand that some people think the lockdown and it's consequences are not the lesser evil. But I personally feel like no lockdown would be even worse. That doesn't mean I am fine with forcing people to lose everything. If anything, I do believe the government is not taking these people into consideration enough, leaving them behind with the consequences of the lockdown that the government, even though in my opinion rightfully, forced on to them. I feel like there are wrong priorities in some cases. </p>
<p>I do not agree that these lockdowns are a form of legal plunder and ethically abominable. But I certainly understand the concerns of people like you. Some people are not getting the attention they should by the government, as far as I can tell, suffering from the lockdown much more than from the virus. </p>
<p>But the idea of the lockdown is to try and reduce the spread of the virus as much as possible, that's not ethically abominable in the slightest. And I do believe that the lockdown has saved many, many lifes. So its an assesment of options one has. The lockdown is indeed very harsh, but no lockdowns and other measures would mean many, many more dead people. So I personally think the lockdown was the right decision. That is of course if there really wouldn't have been other ways to prevent the spread of the virus just as well. </p>
<p>I do think the lockdown can't go on for much longer though. At some point, the lockdown will indeed most likely cause just as much or even more harm than the virus in my eyes. There have been many hygiene concepts created as far as I know, these need to be used now and the lockdown needs to be lessened more and more.</p>

<p>Voluntary measures as in Sweden would have worked just as well. There are plenty of publications on the topic. When 0.15% of the population dies from a disease with mortality of 0.30%, you can't claim that the measures taken have worked.</p>

        <p>I would say that is a fair argument. Though it still doesn't convince me that most countries without a lockdown would have not had more deaths than now with the lockdown. Because the mortality rate is also affected by the lockdowns, or am I missing something? Isn't the mortality rate the percentage of deaths from corona world wide? </p>
<p>Admittedily, Sweden is definitely an interesting example of how to handle the virus without a lockdown. But I feel like there might be other reasons as to why the virus isn't as bad in sweden, for example it's also possible that the virus was never as bad in sweden to begin with. </p>
<p>At the very least though I hope such points are heavily dealt with before any country even considers to force another lockdown after this one ends. But I have high hopes that with more and more vaccines, we won't need to even consider another lockdown during the next winter.</p>

        <p>First of all I really appreciate the thought out posts and respectful responses. We need more of this kind of debate. I'm sorry that (some) others here are giving you a hard time. I imagine it's the frustration of 99% of arguments about this ending with someone saying they wish our entire families die in front of us. Doesn't justify taking it out on others, of course, extremely counter-productive.</p>
<p>Anyway, one point that is that I don't think "more deaths with or without lockdowns" should be the criteria. Here are some points that can make lockdowns unethical even if they lead to less total deaths in the short term:</p>
<ul>
<li>years of life lost: you <em>can not</em> argue that the death of a 20 year old is the same as the death of an 82 year old(average age of covid deaths). I'm not saying the deaths of 82 year olds aren't sad or tragic, but if "dying at 82" and "dying at 20" were equivalent then some people would choose to die at 20. Yet no one who is not in extreme misery does</li>
<li>Quality of life lost: a much more iffy and gray area argument I agree, but I think a lot of people will agree that for example the year of your life 20-21 is way more important and meaningful and memorable than 80-81, making it even less ethical to rob people of that year </li>
<li>Long term effects: The virus makes a lot of people who are 82 now (average age of death for the virus) die now instead of in 5 years (average life expectancy for an 82 year old). How many people who are currently 20, will die at 82 instead of 85, in 60 years, because of the negative mental health and physical effects of the virus?</li>
<li>Authoritarianism: no, I'm not arguing "wearing a mask is against my freedom". But I <em>am</em> arguing that we don't usually force people to sacrifice for others' well being. If someone needs an organ donor, we don't force you to give a kidney because you can still live with the other. After disasters that lead to a shortage of blood, we make blood donation drives, we don't force everyone in the city to donate theirs. If your neighbor needs 80,000$ for a heart operation but can't afford it, and you happen to have 80,000$ total savings, it is your own personal choice whether to save his life or not. In general we do not force people to sacrifice for the sake of others, even when it is the moral thing to do. And whether it is the moral thing to do depends on the severity of the sacrifice and the potential consequences if you don't. Millions of people have already had covid. They are immune. Their sacrifice protects no one, and saves no one. Why are we not allowing them to live yet?</li>
<li>the way the lockdown has been executed: even if you support lockdowns in general, you can see that many current ones are nonsensical. Shopping at a family run store is dangerous, but Walmart is safe? Going to the beach is dangerous, but filming movies is safe? Etc etc</li>
</ul>

        <p>Yeah immature responses like that will always be a problem, since people can't keep their emotions in tact when participating in a discussion. It's the idea that people which argue against the lockdown or even just the severity of the lockdown don't care about all the people that have died to the virus or are in risk of dying to the virus. </p>
<p>This idea that the consequence and intent are always the same is something very problematic, especially in politics, and that's only when you believe that the consequence of people arguing against the lockdown is more deaths, which of course is not a fair assesment either. </p>
<p>I'm not the most educated on the topic of corona, so I am sure there would be people that could make much better cases for my viewpoints, but I do think it's understandable when people have doubts towards the lockdown. </p>
<p>Regarding your points:</p>
<p>I of course agree that the death of 20 year old is even worse than that of an 82 year old. That's certainly something to keep in mind when comparing corona deaths to suicides due to lockdowns. </p>
<p>The argument of having a year robbed I do understand. I agree partially, but at the same time I find that to not hold a lot of weight when compared to actual deaths, and if people have to live with lots of restrictions for one year in order to save lifes, I personally think those are fair sacrifices to make. And whether you can really say that someone has got a year of their life robbed by the lockdowns is also something that is different from person to person. It's not like they are not living at all during this year.</p>
<p>The third point is a good point. I have little knowledge on such topics, but if there are correlations that can be made between the mental health of people when they are young and their life expectency, then those are factors that do need to be considered now, and especially if and when there is a new pandemic. </p>
<p>I have to disagree with the fourth point. I think such comparisons can't be made that easily. This Corona pandemic affects everyone, or at least potentially does. It's something different then when certain people have certain problems that others could help out with. The Corona pandemic is a danger that concerns every person on this planet more or less, and can only be fought with joint efforts. Because as long as we keep actively spreading the virus, we are further maintaining the higher risk of people dying. </p>
<p>Also, there have been reports of people that have been infected with the virus multiple times, which means immunity only lasts for a certain time period, which seems to vary between people as well. Which is probably why they aren't excluded from the lockdown. Also, if you exclude immune people from the lockdown, how would you want to oversee such a thing? Suddenly you would have to check every person that doesn't follow the rules set by the lockdown whether they are actually immune or not. </p>
<p>I can't argue against the last point. I honestly find it hard to believe any one would actually argue that the lockdowns we see in all the countries have been executed perfectly. In particular the governments often seem to have false priorities, not taking the problems that arise with the lockdown and the people that suffer from those problems serious enough. It's my biggest gripe I have with lockdowns right now. But I do have to acknowledge that the people working in such governments are also just people and aren't perfect. That aspect just gets forgotten often because of the corruption that can also be found in governments, which causes people to think any mistake or bad decision of people in the government is due to those people being corrupt or just stupid. </p>
<p>I've wrote this example in another comment already, but I read somewhere that here in germany the government supported Lufthansa, an airplain company, with 6 billion dollars or something like that, and afterwards they reported they were able to increase the pay of some pilots to up to 15k euros per month or something like that. Meanwhile the money to support many people that are suffering from the lockdowns measures was way, way less. Now granted this was something I only read in the comment section of some article, so I am not sure if this is true, but if it is, that's a very good example of bad priorities in my opinion.</p>

        <p>Thank you. </p>
<p>These are certainly statistics that need to be considered, I agree. I personally still believe the lockdowns helped, but who knows how much, and of course it's possible that the lockdowns ended up doing more harm than good. But I at least understand why lockdowns have happened, and I don't believe in the theories that these are just measures to keep people oppressed and that the panic is just all created by media and higher ups to keep people in check. </p>
<p>One potential problem I see is that even in areas where lockdowns occured, not everyone sticks to the rules, and I could imagine people in particular didn't always follow the rules within the first days, which might have caused the delay in corona numbers going down. But that's admittediley just pure speculation. I'm sure there are reasons to be found to question the conclusions in this article, but certainly it would be beyond stupid to ignore these types of researches as well. Especially for future decisions, if the new Corona variants do prove to be problematic despite vaccines. </p>
<p>I do pray that after this lockdown, we will never have to deal with another lockdown. And I pray that governments will try to think of any forms of alternatives before even considering another lockdown in the future. Even if I believe the lockdowns have done more good than harm until now, I do also believe there will be a point at which this doesn't hold true anymore.</p>

        <p>ad19970, thanks again for the well-reasoned reply. I actually believe your point of view agrees with r/NoNewNormal if we take another look! Let me deconstruct your reply to show you this.</p>
<p>&rt;it's possible that the lockdowns ended up doing more harm than good</p>
<p>I agree with you! The government mandates might have done more harm than good. You also agree that many people have died as the result of lockdowns (in addition to other, hard to quantify losses). It follows that the government is acting unethically; see this quote from Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine at Standford University:</p>
<p>&rt;Lockdowns represent widespread experimentation on a global scale. The  costs to human health and well-being of them are so high, that it is no  wonder that we have avoided using them in past epidemic.</p>
<p>I think you'll find that widespread experimentation on a large population, especially when it is not certain if it is effective, is highly unethical.</p>
<p>&rt;One potential problem I see is that even in areas where lockdowns occured, not everyone sticks to the rules,</p>
<p>Agreed! Even when (almost) everyone follows lockdown rules, the small population of dissenters prevent lockdowns from being effective anyways.</p>
<p>&rt;I pray that governments will try to think of any forms of alternatives before even considering another lockdown in the future</p>
<p>Agreed! Lockdowns can be more harmful than good, at the very least in particular instances.</p>
<p>&rt;I don't believe in the theories that these are just measures to keep  people oppressed and that the panic is just all created by media and  higher ups to keep people in check</p>
<p>This view is completely compatible with this sub.</p>
<p>&rt;...I believe the lockdowns have done more good than harm until now...</p>
<p>I think this statement somewhat contradicts your first point. It seems that you agree that lockdowns are experimental. I think we also would agree that the government should not force experimental measures on its population when lives (and other factors) are at stake; people should have the right to choose.</p>

        <p>&rt; Isn't the mortality rate the percentage of deaths from corona world wide? </p>
<p>I was comparing the actual recorded mortality to the theoretical infection fatality rate, which is basically the worst case scenario in case everyone got infected. What many people don't realize is that despite all measures, in most countries more than 30% of all people eventually got infected. NY and NJ in the USA are two places where more than half of the population got the virus. Which is effectively the same as letting the virus run through the population unhindered.</p>
<p>&rt;for example it's also possible that the virus was never as bad in sweden to begin with.</p>
<p>No, it is very well documented that Sweden had a very high number of carriers in the very beginning. The end of February is the skiing vacation, when tens of thousands of Swedes travel to Italy and France on skiing trips. Exactly one year ago, Italy was the first European country to be hit hard by the pandemic, so many of the Swedish skiers came back infected.</p>

        <p>Ok thanks for the clearification. Though isn't the case fatality rate, which is the death rate among the actual infected people, 2%? The mortality rate of the entire population is 0.3%. Sorry if I am still misunderstanding something, english isn't my native language. </p>
<p>That's interesting and should be considered. I'm not going to argue I am 100% sure that the lockdown was the right thing to do. Just because I believe it was, doesn't mean I am convinced people like you are wrong. And it's good to see some people here are able to have convincing arguments against the lockdown. I think we will never completely be able to tell whether the lockdown was good or not, but certainly scientists in particular will be able to evaluate the outcomes of the lockdowns and none lockdowns to hopefully have better estimations for what to do when we ever have to suffer through another pandemic. </p>
<p>If the lockdowns indeed did more harm than good, than that needs to be considered so that for the next pandemic, we will have different measures in place to try and keep the virus in tact as much as possible without causing nearly as much trouble as the lockdowns did.</p>

        <p>&rt;the case fatality rate, which is the death rate among the actual infected people, 2%?</p>
<p>Case fatality rate is dependent on how many cases have been identified, and with many people never getting tested and many others completely asymptomatic, CFR is misleadingly high.</p>
<p>What I have cited as 0.3% is an estimate of the IFR, the fatality rate for all infections. Different estimates exist between 0.23% and 0.7%, it is very dependent on demographics.</p>
<p>Basically IFR is the mortality you can expect if 100% of the population gets infected. Obviously even without a lockdown this is not very likely to happen. If only the most vulnerable people (those above 65) would take steps to avoid infection, the death rate would decrease 10 fold from the IFR. What we see with lockdowns instead is death numbers near 50% of the theoretical maximum.</p>

        <p>Ok yes that makes sense, the assumed amount of people that were infected is way higher than the official number. </p>
<p>I think this is a fair argument, even if it doesn't fully convince me that the lockdown wasn't helpful to keep people alive. It's something that needs to be considered when trying to evaluate the outcome of the lockdowns and other measures to keep the virus at bay. </p>
<p>I think the death rate would still be definitely higher if we didnn't have a lockdown, much closer to the given mortality rate, like maybe 90%.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is the treatment of the virus. Many people have been saved from the virus thanks to hospitals. Now let's say we didn't have a lockdown, and many more people would get infected. That means more people would have had bad symptomps and would have needed medical treatement, the hospitals could have easily become overloaded, leading to some people not getting the medical treatment they would need. I am positive this would also lead to the IFR increasing noticeable as well, since people would die due to the virus that they would have survived if they would have received proper medical treatement, and therefore the mortality rate of the population of any country would have increased as well, perhaps to more than just the estimated IFR we have now. </p>
<p>That was a serious problem in italy for example when the virus started to spread around the world. </p>
<p>The problem with only isolating older people and those that have a much higher risk of dying to the virus is that the rest of the people would be actively speading the virus continuously. Which means the people at risk and anyone who would want to try to be safe from the virus would be even more isolated from the rest of the world than they are now already, especially the older people. Because if the virus is being spread constantly by the rest of the people, any form of interaction would become even more dangerous for old people and other people of higher risk of dying to the virus. Not to mention that the people at risk would also be isolated for longer periods of time because the virus is being spread constantly. </p>
<p>The idea here is that society works together to try and reduce the spread of the virus as much as possible in order for as many people as possible to get back to a more normal life as fast as possible. </p>
<p>And I do think it's important to note that it's still possible for young people to die to the virus as well, and beyond that, the virus has also proven to have lasting consequences to some people's health long after they had the virus.</p>

        <p>You're right in principle that overwhelmed hospitals could have been a problem, but you are mislead as to what the actual situation was. Hospitals are always operating near capacity, every winter, and covid did not change that. Lockdowns didn't change it either, because for most of the time with lockdowns the hospitals were under capacity and nurses were filming tictock dance routines instead of working. </p>
<p>Now granted if infection had spread more some isolated places could have limited capacity issues for some isolated weeks, but guess what, people living in these places would then voluntarily self isolate. </p>
<p>Your guess that we could ever come so near the maximum IFR is also wrong, because when more people have had the virus and recovered they serve as a natural barrier, so infections could not get much above 75%. Which they will eventually come close to even with lockdowns in many places.</p>
<p>Young people dying and long term consequences are extremely rare, it's well documented, and I don't need to hear anecdotes about it.</p>

        <p>I think you make fair points, though I am not sure if I understand your argument against the idea of overwhelmed hospitals without a lockdown. It might be the case that hospitals work near capacity every winter, without covid. But this not being really different this year could also be because of the lockdown. Because if hospitals do work at near capacity every winter, than it's fair to assume that at some point, too many people with serious corona symptomps that would need medical treatment would overwhelm the hospitals because they need to be treated additionally to all the other sick people.</p>
<p>Of course there is an overlap of covid patients and patients that would need to be treated at hospitals for different reasons as well, so that's something one needs to keep in mind.</p>
<p>But I doubt people in areas where the hospitals would be overwhelmed would all automatically self isolate voluntarily. Because that presupposes that all people are reasonable, and they aren't. Not only that, but in that case, people in many of such places would most likely react when it's too late and many more people had to die because of the virus. </p>
<p>And yes, young people dying and long term consequences due to Corona are rarities and should be evaluated as such. But they also can't be ignored either.</p>

        <p>As I pointed out already, for most of the year hospitals were not strained, yet the limitations and lockdowns were in place. </p>
<p>&rt;Because that presupposes that all people are reasonable, and they aren't.</p>
<p>That's authoritarianism. People are the ones who decide what is reasonable, not you or the government. If they are not scared and the hospitals do go over capacity, then that is what people want. However there is no proof that that is actually happening anywhere, because once the information is out, people will behave more carefully out of fear, if not anything else.</p>
<p>Voluntary measures ensure that the response from the population is proportional to the real threat, and not to some incompetent gross overestimate of the threat, nor to some fabrication by the government made for political gain.</p>
<p>&rt;And yes, young people dying and long term consequences due to Corona are rarities and should be evaluated as such. But they also can't be ignored either.</p>
<p>Neither can the loss of jobs, destruction of businesses, suicides and overdoses, depression and domestic violence be ignored. But they are.</p>

        <p>I understand your point of view.
However, you may wanna make some research on suicides, for example, in Japan. More people dead from suicide in october only than in the whole year of covid.</p>

        <p>I'm guessing you are referring to this article?: <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/28/asia/japan-suicide-women-covid-dst-intl-hnk/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/28/asia/japan-suicide-women-covid-dst-intl-hnk/index.html</a></p>
<p>I'll admit it's terrible, but one does have to keep in mind that the amount of suicides in October of 2019 was about 1600. Keeping that in mind and comparing that to the 2100+ suicides in October 2020, one could make the argument that only about 500 to 600 people have commited suicide because of the lockdowns, if at all. I wouldn't have a hard time believing some suicides in October were also commited because they may have lost loved ones to the virus, which would further decrease the amount of people that commited suicide because of the lockdowns. </p>
<p>Of course it's still not good, but because of that, I would argue that more people died from Corona than people died from commiting suicide because of the consequences of the lockdown. Of course it's hard to make the deicision then, which people can die and which not, those that are so harshly hit by the lockdown or those people that get killed by the virus. But because of the estimation of experts that many more people would die if there was no lockdown, I do find this lockdown to be understandable and I personally think it's the right decision that was made. But I do believe that the lockdown can't go on for much longer anymore. </p>
<p>I do get the concerns though. And surely I have wondered for myself if a much bigger spread of the virus could have also been prevented with different measures, especially hygiene measures in all areas that would need those. Maybe the virus wouldn't have been prevented quite as well but still good enough to not have another lockdown in the winter. I don't know, I have my doubts, but one can't say for sure. But the biggest problem I see with no lockdown is with people that meet privately. That's probably where the virus spreads the most, especially if bigger groups of people come together. </p>
<p>It's hard though, I understand it. Many people have lost their job, and other people are suffering from mental illnesses because of the lockdowns. And I do feel like those people sometimes aren't considered enough. In particular those that need some financial help.</p>
<p>One report that made me quite upset here in germany was that, at least according to those news, the government gave Lufthansa, an airplain company, 6 billion euros or something like that. After that Lufthansa then reported that they were able to raise the pay of pilots to I believe 15k euros a month, meanwhile many people are fighting for their existance. Those to me are very false priorities of the government.</p>

        <p>Well, it is true that in plain sight it would seem that the numbers are not that alarming. But the title of the article states that women are the most affected by an increase of 80%.</p>
<p>In Japan, women are not like women in the west. Usually they work at restaurants or cafes or hotels or jobs like those. The sectors mostly affected by lockdowns. A lot of them even considered killing their own kids because they cannot feed them.</p>
<p>While these problems have as many layers as an onion, like Japan's issues on mental health that have been going on for a long time, lockdowns undoubtly worsened them.</p>
<p>With that premise in mind, I don't think universal lockdowns make sense. Because first, you are treating every society as if they are the same when it is not. And second, you can't make the cure worse than the disease (the economic impact of this is going to throw a lot of generations into shit). I would gladly accept lockdowns if it was for the risk groups exclusively or if the goverment supported people properly to get by. In Spain the goverment has handed a total of 0€ to help the struggling population. Instead elderly people are left for dead totally unatended while the media claims 24/7 that you should protect your grandma.</p>

<p>I think you're scratching at something important here, and this is where we can find common ground. I completely agree with you, this would be a difficult decision to make, but I would even take it a step further. I would say it is actually <em>unethical</em> to make this decision for a population, without a very strong, well reasoned case in favor of lockdowns.</p>
<p>I think we would both agree that (1) there are factors that at the very least call into doubt the effectiveness of lockdowns. We might also agree that (2) the government should never take action which endangers its population unnecessarily, this would be acting unethically.</p>
<p>If you agree with premises (1) and (2), you'll find that you also agree with the conclusion: government lockdowns are unethical.</p>

<p>The lockdown worsens comorbidities and creates fragilities in healthy people. Once lockdowns are lifted, these problems become exposed and then we lockdown again because pathogen X is killing the people with comorbidities. It's a very vicious cycle. We should not forget the principles of salutogenesis.</p>

        <p>Another thing I would point out, which I consider to be the chief difference between /r/NoNewNormal and /r/LockdownSkepticism is that this sub is much more lightly moderated.  I believe there isn't review of submissions by default here, whereas /r/LockdownSkepticism manually reviews everything that gets in for quality.  Also, there are fairly strict guidelines against discussing masks at /r/LockdownSkepticism; you can do so to some extent in the comments, but you can't make a post about them.</p>
<p>Whatever your feelings on masks, I feel we should all agree that Reddit's policy on banning any sub that opposes masks is an outrage.  If you are a huge fan of masks, you should absolutely hate this policy because it makes it look as if your viewpoint is so fragile that all discussion must be silenced to preserve it.  I don't blame LDS for their censorship on this topic because the mods want to keep their subreddit from being deleted; it's just very depressing that this is where we are though.  I don't know how anyone isn't terrified of how much censorship there is nowadays, even if you are in complete and total agreement with the censors and think their actions are directly saving oodles of lives.  The fact is, those unaccountable people in charge of the censorship have got a terrifying amount of control over public discourse, and that weapon can be turned on anyone.</p>
<p>One other subreddit worth mentioning is /r/LockdownCriticalLeft if you don't like the generally rightward skew of this community.</p>

        <p>Great post. I would recommend this video <a href="https://tomwoods.com/the-covid-cult/">https://tomwoods.com/the-covid-cult/</a> to anyone who wants to start thinking critically about lockdowns but doesn't know where to start.</p>

        <p>This sub is an echo chamber, there is no "open discussion" here. Prove me wrong, please. Also people do get banned for not agreeing.
This post is you justifying in participating in an echo chamber by saying it is not one (into the echo chamber).</p>

        <p>Well crap, i’m already disagreeing with what everyone agrees on. I’ll be fair and say that there is alert fatigue. As in, if there had only been 3 week of quarantine, people would have stayed obedient. Now that it keeps stretching, it’s bullcrap and I agree with the fact that it harms people. Its not something bad when it was used in the beginning, but it became bad by extending and choking businesses. Now, people are not complying and I can see why. There is no ending in sight, even with the vaccine. </p>
<p>However, it’s weird seeing people feel pride in defying safety measures. It’s not a sin for nothing. It doesn’t make you more masculine, or cooler or smart. Hopefully, this sub doesn’t make people give in to hubris or radicalize people. That said, I’m interested in looking at posts here.</p>
