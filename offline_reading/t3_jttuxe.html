        <p>they aren't freaking out over the virus, they're freaking out over the idea that their cushy lives will be disrupted by idiots with no plan.</p>
<p>honestly, people aren't scared that they'll get sick or die, they're worried they'll be stuck in their homes for months without two-ply toilet paper, or Kraft mac 'n cheese, or Tresseme shampoo. people are worried the internet will go out, and then they won't be able to stream video games and TV on demands. they're worried they'll get bored because they don't know how to read a book, or listen to music on tape/CD/record. these people don't even have mp3s anymore.</p>
<p>the West has grown soft and weak and flabby and spoiled. we deserve everything we are about to get.</p>
<p>we're so stupid that instead of stocking up on tissues and cold medicine (It'S nOt ThE fLu!) and Gatorade and chicken stock like we would for a normal cold/flu season, these assholes think it's like KILLER DIARRHEA and they'll die on the toilet. which i guess is fine by them as long as they can stream Netflix while they shit themselves to death, right? lol. morons.</p>

        <p>Thing is, they're again preparing for this like it's a natural disaster where they'll be snowed in or supply chains will be disrupted or something, but it's already been demonstrated that this is not that. People really did not learn.</p>

        <p>honestly, this really grinds my gears, since i come from a family of planners and i work in operations. i always restock the basics in the winter in the event of a bad snowstorm. i make sure we have some kitty litter/salt for the ice, i make sure we have a stocked medicine cabinet, i make sure we have bottled water and paper goods, i make sure we have two weeks of canned food to get by. i listen to the weather, i shop in advance: milk, eggs, bread cheese, bacon, booze. i help pick up stuff for my friends and family. i keep a go-bag. i keep copies of personal documents for me and my husband and family at work locked in a drawer. my husband thinks i'm a complete nut until he talks to my father or mother or brother, and then he just shuts up, lol.</p>
<p>in college i went to school with kids who just strapped on snow chains in the winter from the back of their truck, and i was so jealous of their preparedness.</p>
<p>but honest-to-god, these people are morons, and they deserve to be cancelled by natural selection. this isn't some terrible stomach bug that will kill by making you poop, it's a sort of boring respiratory virus that could turn into nasty pneumonia or bronchitis. have you ever had a bad sinus infection? they're awful! but you need Kleenex and sudafed, not TP. i mean, you can use TP when you run out of tissues, but i mean... common sense, it's lacking.</p>
<p>i stocked up on boxed wine, paper products, and cleaning supplies over the summer when i saw lockdown 2: electric boogaloo coming at us right around election time.</p>
<p>sure, i might have ten gallons of Dawn and 8 jugs of white vinegar and several gallons of bleach, and i now own stock in Mrs Meyers/Tide/Comet/Scrubbing Bubbles/Windex/Murphys/Wet Jet/Downey. but i won't need to buy cleaning supplies for like two years! and if people ask what's wrong with me, i just tell them i might need to get rid of a body, and that shuts folks right up!</p>
<p>i also have 18+ boxes of red wine - one in every flavor! - and Pop Tarts.  and a chest freezer full of meat - best anniversary gift ever! </p>
<p>but look, i wouldn't have all these cleaning supplies if i didn't expect the supply chain to fail and people to lose their minds over the flu.</p>
<p>the wine? yes. of course. my god! the snows in Virginia are quick and cold and deep. yikes. what if i couldn't walk to Target?! #preparedness</p>
<p>people have gotten dumber since March and i don't feel bad for them at all. enjoy, assholes.</p>

        <p>Panic is an irrational reaction to a threat, real or imagined. Confronted with the total loss of their freedom and rights as citizens (real threat), they prepare for the total breakdown of society and a deadly gastrointestinal disease (imagined threat). This is because of both the natural fight or flight reaction that all animals have, and the propaganda and rhetoric coming out of governments / news media / social media / pop culture etc. Doomerism inspires panic, and panic is rarely rational or measured.</p>

        <p>But he said, he was stocking up over a long period of time, the problem with panic buying is buying a whole lot ar one time. Buying one extra case of toilet paper to save over a period of 6 months, is not as disruptive as buying 40 cases in one day,</p>

        <p>I know what he said. The fact remains that he is still hoarding toilet paper. Hoarding is simply buying more of something than you need. I don’t care if that is over a week or over several months. The end result is the same.</p>
<p>His “justification” is also literally exactly the same as all the nut jobs you see pictures of. He is afraid that TP is going to run out in the future (perceived scarcity) so he is buying more than he needs. If enough people do the same thing, you will have another supply shock. </p>
<p>The person doing the morally correct thing is simply not purchasing large amounts of toilet paper right now. Again the timing of this hoarding behavior doesn’t change anything. It is still adding to the problem. </p>
<p>As long as you have running water and soap, you will be fine. </p>
<p>If you don’t have running water and soap, you have bigger problems to worry about than TP.</p>

        <p>There is nothing wrong with stocking up on any particular item and having a bit of reserve in case of emergency. The problem arises when everyone stocks up on a particular item suddenly at the same time.</p>

        <p>It's just a simple fact that by buying more than you ordinarily would you are contributing to the problem you are complaining about. Perhaps not as much as someone else, but some nonetheless.  I didn't say there was anything wrong with it by the way, just that it is so.  I am sorry if that hurts your feelings.</p>

        <p>It doesn't hurt my feelings, I just think you are looking at it the wrong way. I'm not emptying the shelves every time I go, or if there is only a little bit left of what I want, I don't buy it because I have it at home already and can get some at another time. I have a family of five, and last time this happened, we were fucked. We had to ask for TP, papertowels, food and other things from neighbors. It was infuriating and embarrassing. </p>
<p>Ever since then I didn't want to be a complete asshole but I also didn't want to be royally fucked like last time. So I buy little bits here and there.   </p>
<p>Sorry if you think that's contributing to the problem but I certainly don't think so. It's not like I have a full shipping container of TP lol. relax bud</p>

        <p>All right then, I wasn't trying to start a fight or anything. In fact, I mentioned this conversation to my wife on our walk today..... at first she didn't see my point, at all, but then I expounded a bit and then I think she did.  And I want to reiterate that I don't think you did anything wrong, no matter how much or how many of anything you bought.  But it is what it is.  It's like when we are stuck in traffic, we complain about it, but we don't often think about how we are contributing to it ourselves.  I used to do a food service thing, and as a courtesy I provided a bag of disposable forks.  Well, someone in the office took those forks, stating that he did it before someone else came along and took them all.  It never occurred to him that he was doing the exact thing he didn't want to happen.</p>
<p>Glad you're not emptying the shelves, or taking more than you need.  My wife also mentioned that we try to keep ahead of things in order to keep 'stocked up'.  I agree with her, and said yeah but that's no different than we always do. But I guess the main reason I replied to you is because you called the people who also bought essential supplies "morons".  And you bought yours before they "would spaz out again".  Perhaps those people also have a family of five, and the last time this happened they were also fucked.  And perhaps they too had to ask for things from neighbors, and were embarrassed.  \</p>
<p>All I'm saying, and I stand by it, is that if you are buying more than you ordinarily would, for whatever reason, you are contributing to the problem you complain about.</p>

        <p>I only called them morons because they’re spazzing out over literally nothing. The government already stated that normal supply chains wouldn’t be stopped during the “pandemic” and literally the only thing that would change (at that time anyway) is you can’t eat inside a restaurant. That was literally the only difference I noticed during the last “lockdown” was we couldn’t eat inside lol.</p>

        <p>You didn't witness that.  Why would you say that?</p>
<p>Besides, if everyone bought one or two "extra" of anything, shortages would be the outcome.  We've gone full circle; I said if you buy more than you normally would, you are contributing to the problem you complain about.  And you have been buying "extra" as you admit.  When everyone buys "extra", shortages happen.</p>
<p>What are you not seeing here?  No one is buying 400 rolls of TP etc.  You know that.  It's people buying "one or two extra.... twice a month" ..... when enough people (like you) do that, it leads to shortages.</p>

        <p>Yeah, back in the Spring, before the first round of panic buying, people <em>were</em> doing that.  Since then, there 1.) hasn't been panic buying until a few days ago and 2.) stores have put limits on what amount people can buy.  But <strong>you</strong>, have been buying extra for the last 6 months because people have been "spazzing out" by buying "400 rolls of TP".  That hasn't been happening in the last 6 months, so yeah, I know what you <strong>didn't see</strong>, over these last 6 months.  Get outta here.</p>
<p>And by the way, again, I wasn't criticizing you at all..... I merely pointed out your hypocrisy because I objected to you calling people disparaging names (I really hate that).  In fact, I commend you for doing what it takes to provide for your family of five.  But that's what <em>everyone</em> is doing, including yourself.  Yes, I see the empty shelves.  That is a result of people buying more than they ordinarily would, just as you have been doing.  Somehow, you seem to think that when <em>you</em> buy more it is perfectly fine, but when <em>they</em> buy more, it is not.  It's probably time to rethink that one.  And again, I don't believe you have seen people who "bought 400 rolls of TP, 32 things of hand sanitizer, 200 rolls of paper towels etc" within the last 6 months, and if you stand by that claim then yes, I am calling you a liar.</p>

        <p>I will admit I am concerned about another massive supply chain disruption akin to what impacted the nyc metro area march-may. Shelves of everything were 50-100% bare including basic food staples and necessary hygiene products (including feminine products). I personally am not panic or hoard buying, just making an observation.</p>

        <p>“I do my time on company dime”</p>
<p>And that’s a big part of the whole TP mess—the shortage earlier in the year was a combination of packaging issues (i.e. giant commercial rolls vs normal sized retail rolls), and a minor panic.</p>
<p>Now the packaging issue is probably less of an issue (given that we’ve been in this situation for 6+ months), but the panic issue is completely different.</p>
<p>I think the big factor here is that most of the people who were desperate for TP when it was short 6 months ago hadn’t really stocked up for a long term disruption in the interim. As a result, now that they’re seeing the politicians talking about locking down again they want to make sure that they don’t run out again.</p>

        <p>All this talk of new lockdowns is sending people into panic again. And I completely understand why. Lockdowns are the greatest assault on freedom we’ve seen since World War 2. It’s an instinct of all animals (including humans) to store food and supplies ahead of an upcoming disaster.</p>

        <p>I’m starting to need to go to two grocery stores to complete my order. Last week my primary store was almost cleaned out of chicken, which sent me to store #2. Disinfectant wipes are still non-existent here unless it’s an off brand. Hand sanitizer and soap are more plentiful though. I think people are really buying into the “Wolf’s going to shut down again” rumor that’s been circulating since August. </p>
<p>I just signed up to be an Instacart shopper and did my first batch yesterday. Had to make six replacements for the customer. Luckily he was very relaxed about it. But the store was also packed and lines were backed up into the aisles.</p>
