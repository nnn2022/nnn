    <strong>Personal anecdotes are unreliable!</strong>
    <p><p>A big reason why people are stuck in this online hivemind prison is because they are taught to not trust their own guts or personal experiences to form their own opinions. </p>
<p>I got in an argument online because “vaccine misinformation” is rampant on Facebook, which includes the thousands of negative personal anecdotes people have had with the vaccine. </p>
<p>“People are inherently biased, you can’t trust someone that says their negative reaction is coming from the vaccine because you don’t know their previous thoughts on them”, something along the lines of that...</p>
<p>Well this becomes a lot more abstract with real conversations and experiences in real life. They are terrified of other people’s ability to take in information and form a different opinion, they want to make sure all the information is curated and packaged directly from the source. You can filter information you see online but you can’t filter peoples real life experiences. Needless to say most people don’t have their fear of covid driven by personal experience. </p>
<p>I don’t care what you say, when a hivemind is collectively agreeing that you shouldn’t trust your instinct, only accept what we all accept...I am not interested in being anywhere near that hivemind. To me life is all about your personal experience interacting with the world around you. Fuck off with telling me my personal experience doesn’t matter.</p></p>

        <p>This.</p>
<p>When my husband got covid a year ago, I was absolutely blown away at how different his experience was from what I'd been trained to expect by the media. The media told me that you could get "mild" covid, but that even "mild" covid was some crazy shit you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy. Or, you could get "severe" covid. Or you could be "asymptomatic". There were no stories whatsoever about having a case SO mild that it wouldn't even be memorable.</p>
<p>Well, not only did he have a case that wasn't memorable, so did eight of the nine co-workers who had it. One lady was like, "Yeah, I coughed for a day."</p>
<p>It was then that I realized that the media's job is to carefully curate the information that reaches the public. And until you DO have personal experience, that carefully curated information is all you'll ever have to go by. Why, after having seen what I've now seen, would I ever discard it and go back to what I was told (which was obviously a huge exaggeration).</p>

        <p>It took a personal experience with it for me to realize the BS surrounding it too. Covid went around my friend group in December. My friends sister had symptoms, none of my friends had symptoms but many tested positive. After masking, quarantining and fearing the outside for months I started to wonder why my entire life was put on hold by people out of my control. </p>
<p>At the end of the day the only thing you can truly 100% believe in is the way you feel. This entire covid operation wouldn’t even be possible in the 90s without social media. Back then your individuality and personal experience was praised.</p>

        <p>This why i just read from reddit. I used to asnswer technical question from other subs inorder to help. Most of my answers are based on my experiences. Some people argue with me for not saying the proper terminology (english is not my first language). One time they showed me a link from wikipedia about the difference in drywalls. I told them i used to build my own drywalls for years. </p>
<p>This is why theres a generational gap. Old people often teach the young ones how to do things based on their experiences and countless mistakes. Young people would rather read from articles from people who dont know them nor care for them. In the end they have full of theoretical knowledge but nothing gets done.</p>

        <p>Haha yes younger people are definitely trigger happy with the google searches. There is no substance to this constant inflow of information if they aren’t applying it to real life. And the golden standard for any statement on this site is to frantically google a source for your claim. I was once asked for a source of my claims that big pharma is a for-profit cooperation and I was baffled, that isn’t even a scientific statement. It wasn’t even controversial two years ago!</p>

        <p>Thats why theres so much problem that dont get sorted out. People google and ask reddit for solutions instead of asking their relatives or neighbors that can actually see the problem. People dont talk anymore in real life. Why not ask your handy  neighbors for your plumbing/car etc issues. Maybe they can help and build personal relationship with them instead of asking google or reddit.</p>

        <p>Many people (mostly younger, teens and 20s) are suffering from derealization and base the foundations of their personal relationships around social media. Even if you know someone in real life, chances are your relationship with them is impacted by some behavior online (didn’t text me back? Not interested! She didn’t like my instagram? She must think I’m ugly!) I’m in my mid 20s, I’m definitely part of the problem, but I’m glad I made it out of middle school without an iPhone. If social media had been as prevalent during my key development years I would be much worse off. People are terminally online now and wonder why they feel hopeless with no connection to the “real world” when they have to put their airpods in anytime they go in public.</p>

        <p>I know my personal experience includes bias and is limited in scope. I trust the data. The data where pfizer themselves state they don't know what the long term effects are. The data that says 20 years of experimentation has not led to a viable vaccine application of mRNA. The data that says that cpvid is a non issue to healthy people.</p>
<p>I don't understand how anyone can see this data and not come to the same conclusions. I mean I understand. It's a bunch of indoctrinated people who have never had an original thought which made it to the surface. But I don't get it. I have no empathy (or sympathy?) for these people. It's so obvious.</p>

        <p>it really doesn't matter what you'll say. feelings don't care about facts. you can cite them virulence in highly vaccinated nations like gibraltar or great britain, or bring up that cdc admits vagginated being super spreaders and most of them won't bat an eye.</p>
