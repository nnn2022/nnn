    <strong>ostracized by family, they wont even talk to me anymore</strong>
    <p><p>its been 2 days since my argument with my grandparents. They wont even talk to me anymore. They told my mom about it to. She screamed at me to “LOOK AT THE FACTS” while saying that “there will be lifelong damage for healthy people” at the same time as saying “we dont know what this virus does yet!”. She also told me that my grandparents have been in a state of depression since they heard my opinion. Im SO FUCKING SICK of this! I cant believe that they are having a MENTAL BREAKDOWN over hearing a different opinion. My mom tried to manipulate me by saying its people like mes fault that we couldnt meet our great grandma in her last moments before she died. Shes guilt tripping me and went into MULTIPLE SOBBING FITS.I dont even know if my family loves me anymore. I dont even know if I love them anymore. I always have this sinking feeling in my gut now, I cant even look them in the eyes. These are the people you lock yourself in for. Fat, guilt tripping retards that that try to manipulate children not old enough to drive into believing they are the reason for thousands of deaths. I dont even know what to do anymore.</p></p>

<p>Triangulation. My mom used to do the same thing. Chances are your grandparents did not say anything like that. (And if they did, it’s fucking ridiculous; who blames a mental disorder on a disagreement with a distant relative?) She would often tell me that I am “hurting” people I did not speak to directly, in order to guilt me into agreeing with her. Yeah, sounds totally irrational, I know. </p>
<p>Your mother has some deep-seated issues that probably won’t get diagnosed for the sake of her pride. Think of this event as her showing you her true colors. The pandemic only accelerated this process for you.</p>
<p>And if no one in the family is talking to you over this, it’s probably a smear campaign. Look up the terms I used here (triangulation, smear campaign) and see if you can talk with a therapist about it.</p>
<p>This might be an unpopular opinion, but you don’t HAVE to keep in touch with your family if they treat you this way.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. It’s not fair, and it’s absolutely not your fault. </p>
<p>When people become fanatical over an issue, they simply stop thinking and run on pure emotions. It’s devastating to deal with when it is your family, and infuriating in all cases because people who are driven by emotion instead of reason generally make objectively shitty decisions. </p>
<p>The thing that enrages me the most is when someone who hasn’t looked (and refuses to look at) at the available evidence tells <em>me</em> to “look at the facts.” </p>
<p>That’s a clear sign that you are talking to a wall, and should immediately stop. When that happens, I come here and talk to sane people to help me realize that yes, it really, truly is the rest of the world that’s gone bonkers.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the club; I showed them the hard science back in early April and they <strong>still haven't looked at it</strong>. </p>
<p>The excuses are sad "I can't watch a 2 hour presentation!" may have worked for a couple weeks, but it has been 6 months now... fuckin' depressing. I have just written off those family members as "already dead". I should have my own funeral for their brains/attention spans.</p>
<p>I went through 2 straight weeks of no-sleep and constant research before it even "hit the USA" and found a 2 hour presentation that summed up all my findings, they wouldn't read any of the papers I sent, and they won't watch a 2 hour presentation.</p>
<p>If you can't find 2 hours in 6 months to completely obliterate the false narrative being pushed, I guess you just love your enslavement.</p>

        <p>When you don't agree with someone close to you it's okay to smile and nod at them while holding steadfast in your own beliefs. You can try and tip toe through a minefield but eventually you're going to step on something that blows up in your face. The art of keeping shit copacetic is a good skill to have in today's day and age since we're surrounded by tribalism and anger regardless of which side it's coming from. The time it takes for a persons attention span to drift off topic is wayyyy faster than trying to change their mind while devolving into a shouting match in a mud pit. Especially with people like that who have the emotional fortitude of a popsicle stick.</p>

        <p>It's really hard to be awake when the rest of your family isn't. Cognitive dissonance is a very real and very powerful thing, and the human ego will do pretty much anything to protect itself. Also remember, it's easier to convince a person of a lie than it is to convince someone they've been lied to.</p>
<p>If you can, maybe distance yourself from the members of your family that are being toxic to you right now. Take care of yourself, including your own mental well-being. Your mother sounds a lot like mine, mine did the same kind of narcissistic guilt-tripping when anything did not go her way. I ended up distancing myself from her, both physically and emotionally, over the last four years, and though it's been really hard (especially at first, since she kept telling me how I was "breaking the family apart"), it not only helped cure me of being a doormat to people, but it was also the wake-up call my mom needed to finally seek help for her own mental health issues.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to make any assumptions about your family or anything. I just noticed a parallel to my own family. I wish you luck. Hang in there, and try not to let this make you bitter and resentful like it has done to me.</p>

        <p>Ok first it was wrong of your mother to do that but second if you're speaking of opinions I'm assuming your opinion falls somewhere along the lines of no masks if we go without masks it won't kill anyone and if that is your thought process how much does it really hurt you to wear a goddamn mask man even if the virus isn't as bad as everyone says it's so much simpler and safer to just wear a mask and be careful I mean really if you watched your family die from it knowing it was your fault the guilt you would feel would be enough to get you to need therapy and if it wasn't then you didn't think of them as your family</p>

        <p>Kids are being kept from their friends, their extracurricular activities, even from the classroom and you’re telling OP that wearing a mask when out of the house is the answer - and also trying to lay a guilt trip. Talk about a tone deaf response. Kids should not “go along to get along.” They are getting the short end of this and adults should be willing to take on the COVID “risk” to avoid damaging their future even more. We flattened the curve. The virus is going to run its course regardless of what we do. OP, I’m glad that you spoke out on this to your family. You will be proven right. Give them time to calm down, avoid the subject for now, but don’t buy into the emotional manipulation.</p>

        <p>I am a 17 year old I've watched people close to me die from this. I've watched my little cousin die from this. I watched my grandfather die from this. I'm not telling OP that it's the cure all just by wearing a mask I'm simply asking how much does it hurt  to wear a mask and be careful around your grandparents and people who could Interact with them. Kids being "kept from their friends" shouldn't even compare to lives of children and the elderly. As I've already said it was very wrong for the mother to react this way afterall she became very hostile and immediately begun blaming OP for something out of their control. That was wrong all that does is create more conflict and unnecessary drama. Personally I believe the way your grandparents acted was fair and reasonable I mean they lived so long now imagine if they were killed by a disease without getting to see your full potential OP. You have to wonder if the enjoyment of children is worth killing a good chunk of america's population.</p>

        <p>As I just said one of them was my grandfather who was 68. My little cousin was turning 9. You guys are acting as if they are immune and it can't hurt them. They are not immune that's just how it is people who were asymptomatic gets a new mutated version of the virus which has proven to be more dangerous to children. Kids don't have immune systems that are just godlike and make it so every lethal disease disappears and the elderly are in risk because they likely experienced respiratory issues at one point whether it be from whenever smoking was thought to be healthy or another reason. The chances of 2 people from the same family to die from this are higher than your making it sound afterall y'know they live in the same house one has it they all have it. Listen all that is needed is to be careful I'm not saying that cures it I'm just saying why risk others lives for no reason or at least no reason worth taking another person's life</p>

        <p>Your cousin was one of only 28 kids between age 5 and 14 who died of coronavirus in the United States. </p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#AgeAndSex</p>
<p>To put it in context, 211 kids between 5 and 17 died of the flu last year.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html</p>
<p>Was your cousin overweight? That seems to be the greatest risk factor for children dying of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Honestly, because your cousin was one of only 28 kids in the US who died of this, it would be fairly easy to figure out who you are over the web, so it really might not be a good idea to go around mentioning such specific  identifying information on the internet.</p>

        <p>I think the real point though, is that as awful as it is to have your cousin pass, kids are essentially immune to Corona via the stats.</p>
<p>I get that statistical data doesn't mean much when you or a loved one are part of the stats, but that really does matter when you try to make and implement policy on a larger scale. If we always tried to change things everyime a single person died from anything, it would not be realistic and would probably even be harmful or counter productive.</p>
<p>I'm sorry about your loss, but its not reflective of the virus as a whole and we can't make policies based on how it affected you.</p>

        <p>Every mortal is responsible for his own destiny. Other people's health is not my responsibility. It is not my job to protect every other person from this virus, nor any other virus. Humans will always get sick, that is nature. If not this virus, then a different one. This is why we have immune systems. If I get sick, it is because my immune system failed to stop the virus from spreading before I became symptomatic. I am not afraid of getting sick, as that is a part of life and I have accepted that. If I get sick and it ends up killing me, so be it; I'm mortal and will die someday from something anyway. But I will not live my life in fear of death.</p>

        <p>&rt; how much does it really hurt you to wear a goddamn mask man even if the virus isn't as bad as everyone says it's so much simpler and safer to just wear a mask and be careful I mean really if you watched your family die from it knowing it was your fault the guilt you would feel would be enough to get you to need therapy and if it wasn't then you didn't think of them as your family</p>
<p>For people with rosacea, ptsd, claustrophobia, sensory disorders, cystic acne, nasal drip, and many other conditions wearing a mask <em>really</em> is difficult. Just because it’s not difficult for <em>you</em> and the people in your little bubble, doesn’t mean that’s the case for <em>everybody</em>.</p>

        <p>I can kind of understand ptsd and claustrophobia but how would nasal drip and cystic acne and sensory disorders hurt? Cystic acne and nasal drip would be annoying sure maybe sting a bit sometimes but that's it sensory disorders or at least spd only causes information to seem off and weird I mean it wouldn't make much sense for any of this to become a major changing point ptsd is another where I can understand because I don't know what event caused their ptsd</p>

        <p>Cystic acne would be irritated and become infected may never heal for those who have to wear a mask in 100+ degree weather for 8 hrs a day. The mask creates moisture so people with nasal drip’s noses will be constantly dripping, causing a constant irritating damp spot in the middle of the mask which could spread nasal bacteria to and around the mouth causing sores and breakouts. This is especially bad for people prone to cold sores and herpes of the nose, which is highly contagious, so everytime they touch their mask to adjust it and then touch a surface, they risk spreading it. Sensory disorders may cause what feels like a gentle touch to the average person to feel likes hammer or a searing pain to hyper-sensitive people. Nikola Tesla had it for sound, sometimes the slightest noise like the breeze through leaves would sound overwhelming like trains and horns and sirens. Many people perceive things differently, so what’s not bothersome to you, might be like water drip torture or a personal hell to someone else.</p>
