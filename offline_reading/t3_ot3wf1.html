    <strong>Things to ask your employer if they ask you (or demand from you) to get the jab. If they aren't willing to sign any of these, you are not obligated to take the jab, then.</strong>
    <p><p>NOTE TO EMPLOYER: As your employee, I am requesting that you review this document, provide the requisite information, and sign the form, in regards to your requirement that employees get a Covid-
19 emergency use authorization (EUA) investigational vaccine.</p>
<p>1) If I agree to receive an EUA Covid-19 injection, does my employee health insurance plan provide 
complete coverage should I experience an adverse event, or even death? </p>
<p>2) As an employee, does my life insurance policy provide any coverage in the event that I die from 
receiving an EUA Covid-19 injection? </p>
<p>3) As an employee, will you be providing Workersâ€™ Compensation, disability insurance, or other 
resources if I have an adverse event to an EUA Covid-19 injection and am unable to come to work for 
days, weeks, or months, or if I am disabled for life? </p>
<p>4) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that EUA vaccine recipients be provided with 
certain vaccine-specific information to help them make an informed decision about vaccination.</p>
<p>The EUA fact sheets that must be provided are specific to each authorized Covid-19 injection and are developed by the manufacturers of the injections (Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford/AstraZeneca, 
and the Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary Janssen).</p>
<p>The fact sheets must provide the most current and 
up-to-date information on the injections, and vaccine recipients must also receive information about 
adverse events. Have you read, understood, and provided me (and all other employees) with these 
fact sheets and with current information on adverse events so that I/we can make an educated 
decision?</p>

        <p>At least the French are showing some teeth. I'm amazed of how the US citizens are so passive about this. Americans rn are literally so divided by race, sexual orientation, religion, etc, they can't join together to organize like this. </p>
<p>The few times I've been in Paris I was always warned about strikes and how these could affect travel, accomodation, etc. This needs to explode exponentially.</p>
<p>Massive media will surely frame them as the baddies (much like the unvaccinated or the Conspiracy theorists) but this is actually one of the few times I've seen the health sector raising their voice. It already happened in Spain, here and there and in Germany. If this continues, they won't be able to hide it. We need this to happen in the US.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure the policies of this insurance will be altered if the vaccine in question is becoming mandatory. Since the pharmaceutical companies are not to be held accountable for any injury you may suffer, then you can actually skip the vax legally without even having to consider this insurance. </p>

        <p>Most of the vaccines being applied are made in the US. This institution is an hegemonic governing entity which has a significant leverage in a lot of countries even though it is only supposed to govern and regulate in the US. In other words, they are the ones who approve certain goods and/or services being exported from the US to the world, so they should be held accountable if big pharma isn't.</p>

        <p>What you're saying is nonsense. Every countries have their own way of approving vaccines and medicines. They aren't relying on the FDA.<br>
Beside, many countries do have a program for giving indemnity to vaccine injured people. For exemple, we got <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2020/12/government-of-canada-announces-pan-canadian-vaccine-injury-support-program.html">a brand new program for that in Canada</a> and we already got <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/sante/conseils-et-prevention/vaccination/indemnisation-des-victimes-vaccination">one in Quebec for over 30 years already</a>. In fact, all countries from the G7 got an indemnity program for vaccine injuries. Canada was the last country from the G7 to implement such program.<br>
Where do you live to have no such program available?</p>

        <p>Even though every country has an FDA equivalent, it is not sovereign from their mandates. And yes, they do, in very specific cases, like the scamdemic, rely on the FDA. Not officially, but it is implicit. 
Where do they over reach their mandate?, well, so called "third world countries".
I don't really get why you're trying to discredit me by stating that what I'm replying to you is nonsensical. </p>
<p>You're just not aware, that is it. That doesn't make me nonsensical. It just makes you ignorant about something you're "sure" of. </p>
<p>You asked why I'm bringing the FDA into a document that anyone can demand to be signed from their employers in the case of a mandatory vaccination, well it's bc this is the department that is responsible (in second place) for dealing genetic therapy in the form of a vaccine now that the main brands producing this gene therapy are being immunized from lawsuits.</p>

<p>Well, yes you are. Telling people they are entitled to bully their employer into signing a responsibility contract when you live in a country where an indemnisation program already exist is disinformation.</p>

        <p>Hum. Turns out that I didn't look for <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/faq">the right program</a> :</p>
<p>&rt;COVID-19 vaccines are covered countermeasures under the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), not the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.</p>
<p>So, it is covered, but by another program.</p>

        <p>While I agree with the spirit, as a corporate officer I would never acknowledge or sign such a thing.  In particular</p>
<p>&rt; and do hereby agree to assume 100% ,nancial responsibility for 
covering any and all expenses from adverse events, including death, through insurance coverage or 
directly. In addion, I aNrm that the employee will not be subjected to the loss of their job should 
they decline to receive a Covid-19 injecon</p>
<p>Why would anyone sign such a thing? </p>
<p>It's a great questionaire, but has no teeth. </p>
<p>I think a better legal approach is the  " you are asking for medical information from employees.  I therefor request information on all existing conditions of all employees as they may affect me personally. "  there are a couple of form letters around.</p>

        <p>In the legal vernacular "teeth"  means simply if you don't, I am going to do this.  There's nothing of that in this document. It's simply "I'm requesting all of this" but no "or else". </p>
<p>That's why I like the other approach.  If you claim to be protecting us from medical problems, I request a list of medical problems that I might be exposed to (including flu
STDs,Hepatitis, on and on , and request that you take proper measures to protect me from those as well.  You can include the common cold. </p>
<p>If you search this sub you can find a couple of examples.</p>
