    <strong>It's stupid how we keep being called anti-vaxxers instead of anti-RUSHED-vaxxers...</strong>
    <p><p>In February/March 2021: "The best option is whatever vaccine is available to you! Get your shots"</p>
<p><strong>Johnson and Johnson temporarily suspended (then later allowed again)... but still this happened after the statement above.. which could've been avoided with more time instead of rushing... oops?</strong></p>
<p>March/April 2021: "Barely any side effects, and even if there is, still better than catching Covid-18"</p>
<p><strong>Now in May/June 2021, the reports about Myocarditis has risen more, unlike in previous months where most reports were only about body pain (for both genders) or period problems for women, so this statement 100% aged like milk. If we didn't know about a previous side effect as early as last month... how many more possible side effects could emerge in the next 3, 5, or 7 months?</strong></p>
<p>"Anti-vaxxers are trump supporters/It's trump's fault!!!"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nc9k8w/trump_himself_was_boasting_about_the_vaccine_so/">Fact check: Trump himself has supported getting the vaccine</a></p>
<p>And even if there were anti-vaxxers in this sub, the mods of this sub don't go around banning everyone for simply having a different view point compared to your other echo chambers with power hungry mods</p>
<p>Along with the officials even saying that covid-19 cases for the vaccinated will be counted differently in the statistics compared to the unvaccinated, to make things even more suspicious...</p>
<p>Like... for christ's sakes, look at the damn data as 2021 is progressing! How are people not making the distinction between anti-vaxxers (who are against all vaccines in general) and the ones who are simply waiting to see the full term effects? I had the flu vaccine in October 15, 2020, which is one vaccine that's been used for years so I trust that one, unlike this BRAND NEW one! In a rational world, saying stuff like this would NEVER be frowned upon, and even supported, I mean, its a goddamn new vaccine and you're distributing this thing worldwide to put in people's bodies!! <strong>There is no goddamn undo button if this turns out to be a bad decision!</strong> I swear this world gets dumber than it did the previous day and thats saying something!!</p></p>

        <p>Fuck them, I was not an anti-vaxxer until 2020 when the corruption revealed itself, along with all the bribes + humiliating others who have a different opinion + threats + bullying + censorship, and then to top it all off, Pfizer and Moderna are free from any liability if something goes wrong. </p>
<p>Your post is perfectly reasonable, OP, and it sucks that this even has to be emphasized, but goes to show how far the majority have fallen.</p>
<p>I fucking hate them all and everything they stand for, and hope their system crashes and burns.</p>
<p>Any doomer lurking here gonna call me selfish? Go for it you sheeple.</p>

        <p>Whats funny is that "AntiVaxxers" are the ones calling others Anti Vaxxers. Theyre literally the same people who decried vaccines for kids because it causes Autism and other maladies. Yet are now perfectly comfortable, insistent even, with this brand new, made in a year vaccine with no history. 40yo and older vaccines, used forever, bad. Brand new, only tested on humans, great!</p>
<p>The irony is critical.</p>

        <p>I'm a proud anti vaxxer, have been for years. How can you see how the pharmaceutical industry is with this but think somehow they weren't lying and fudging data with all the other vaccines? Also most anti-vaxxers used to be Pro vax before they had a loved one get vaccine injured</p>

        <p>Agreed. Many people have had all their vaccines... except this one, a completely new technology that's emergency use authorized. I'm astounded that colleges and other places are moving ahead with mandating it, and no one is blinking. And speaking against it gets you shunned. Wrongthink is censored just about everywhere and it's scary to think that there is no true scientific discourse allowed.</p>
<p>That said, do you think the mainstream will eventually have to acknowledge the adverse effects? What do you think the time line is for the vaccine narrative to change for the better?</p>
