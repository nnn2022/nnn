    <strong>I am so tired of all of these lies. How much more are we gonna take? Something has to be done.</strong>
    <p><p>I am so fucking sick of living this way, I feel this non stop gut feeling that I need to do something, not anything violent but just something to help stop all this shit.</p>
<p>I work my fucking ass off in a dangerous job, for no recognition in a hot zone for this God damn "pandemic" and because of all of these restrictions I can't get ahead. Housing has become absolutely insane, food is going up, gas is rising at an alarming rate, the mental health crisis is spiraling out of control, indoctrination in schools.</p>
<p>Everytime I see a "new variant" my fucking blood boils, everytime I see a new restriction my fucking blood boils. We've all been lied to and generations to come are going to absolutely suffer in the worst ways because of it. My hard work, my fiances hard work will mean fucking nothing for my daughter in the future, the long term economic effects of this is going to fucking ruin everyone.</p>
<p>The fruits of all of labors has been fucking poisoned and the powers to be are laughing at us. They're fucking with us at this point. "Herd immunity can't be reached in the u.s", they literally changed the fucking definition of herd immunity to continue stepping on our backs. </p>
<p>I'm just... I don't know anymore, even if we are right and I honestly hope to god we arent.. life is gonna be fucked up in the coming years. </p>
<p>Just prepare guys, maybe if we hold out long enough and we make it through this then we will be the ones who can really make a better world for our kids and even a better one for those who stand so strongly against us.</p></p>

        <p>"maybe if we hold out long enough", if you do that, they'll quickly change the narrative like they switched the narrative a hundred times since last April when the stimmy began in US, when they all posed (both left and right) on a photo-op for a 900+ pages junk, no one remembers now or aware of. US was fortunate of this event, other countries never had the chance to be made aware of the changes to their constitution, bills passed, etc..</p>
<p>If there is anything a commoner could do, is to watch-out for this junk-shit amendments to the law and hard-won constitutions, and don't let them say "read it after you've signed it".</p>

        <p>If millions of people haven't done a damn thing by now, millions of people aren't going to a damn thing.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it's fear, laziness, demoralization or a combination of all three but, the last year has made it abundantly clear that most people are only willing to talk shit in various forums and comment sections. </p>
<p>The younger generations haven't really had to experience what it means to get off the couch, to get outside and to fight  the kinds of things we are facing right now. We have had it easy for a long time. Yes, freedoms have been eroded and radical ideologies have made their way into everything our lives touch but, we still had our sports to watch, our money to make and our parties to attend. Now, we are being told what to wear and not to wear. Where we can go and can't go. How we're supposed to talk. Who we're allowed to like and who we are supposed to dislike. And, we don't have the things that used to distract us from the control mechanism. People don't know what to do. They don't know how to fight the machine. We fear retribution if we do. So, we are confined to demanding change, here on reddit and Twitter and in all the other forums where we feel safe. </p>
<p>We've crossed that point of no return. It's going to take a drastic, big, violent, bloody conflict to change what we have created with our acceptance without public question. And, I'm fairly certain there is only a handful willing to fight that kind of find.</p>
