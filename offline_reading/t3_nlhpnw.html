    <strong>Just another vaccine rant</strong>
    <p><p>I just recently found this sub but am super glad I did because I never knew there were so many people in one place who believed the same thing about the vaccine that I do. </p>
<p>It just feels like this thing somehow continues to get worse. First it was quarantining for a virus that gave people under 78 y/o a little more than the flu. Then it was mask wearing and still is, even though masks don't even really help to protect you. Especially those clear face shields like what are people thinking?? And now it's the vaccine. My great aunt literally died 48 hours after she got it, and she was in perfectly good health before that. One of my friends got it and then was super sick for 4-5 days after. I don't get why anyone would want to take a vaccine that literally <em>makes</em> you sick sometimes. And now how they're saying that if you didn't get the vaccine you have to wear a mask? That makes no sense! If the vaccinated people are "safe" from me, and I don't care about getting COVID, why should I need to wear a mask? It's my health, not yours. It'll most likely just get worse from here.</p></p>

        <p>Do you think surgeons wear masks because they're fashionable? Vaccines protect everyone, including people that are unable to get them. Ive never had chicken pox, mumps, measles, polio, or a buttload of other shit because of vaccines. Yeah its got side effects but whats the point in bitching about being sick for a week to protect yourself and everyone around you from a virus killing millions</p>

        <p>Still regurgitating the shitty points you heard last year, uh? Can you have a single independent thought? I was never breathing down your neck or touching your stuff or spitting in your food. My fucking breathing when I feel perfectly fine is not a threat to humanity.  But the real point now is that anybody who wants the fucking vax can get it, so please leave me out of your psychosis and cruelty (yes lockdown have catastrophic effects duh) By your own account you re a fucking murderer yourself,  surely you ve been out with the sniffles before 2020.  God damn hypocrite pretending to care and be better than everyone while you force everybody to give up life as we know it. Wake up (wo)man, history won't look kindly on the covidian movement</p>

        <p>Yeah your fucking breathing when you feel fine can be a risk, thats the point of the mask. Is it really that hard to wear a little piece of cloth when you're outside your house? </p>
<p>Maybe if people like you followed the rules a year ago and washed your fuckin hands every now and then, we wouldn't still need a lockdown. New Zealand listened, and they're just having a blast over there.</p>

        <p>Bro, miss me with your subjective morality bullshit. Your beliefs are not law, your beliefs are not adopted by every person in this country. Grow up and recognize that people live different lives and make different decisions. I conduct myself as a law abiding citizen and to be respectful of others decisions and lifestyles. If I don’t want the vaccine, conversation should stop right there. How’s that affect you? You’re vaccinated right? Don’t they work?</p>

        <p>I dont get the vaccine for me, I would probably survive the virus. I get the vaccine for all the people I would put at risk, that cant get the vaccine, because they may not survive it. I never implied anyone change their lifestyle or suggested my beliefs were law. Trying to not put peers at risk of a pandemic isnt subjective morality, its a general care for others' life.

Brother, I’m glad you got the vaccine since you felt compelled to “protect” others, that’s cool and ethical on your part.

        <p>You dont need to spit on someone to have a risk of transmitting the virus. I cant make you get the vaccine, and you can't make a business choose to allow you in. You're a risk, and it's their business, their building or whatever. They've got the freedom to bar you from entering. Private businesses dont even need a goos reason to disallow you, its their right.

        <p>So you are comparing going outdoors to an operating room? Cute.</p>
<p>Never had chicken pox, measles, nor mumps? You might want to ask your mother about that one. It is likely you had one of them...</p>
<p>Bringing up other vaccines is problematic. Most folks on here don't have a problem with other vaccines. Some of us actually know how other vaccines are created. This vaccine however... How is it created? We know they haven't actually used COVID cells to create it, but not much else beyond that.</p>
<p>As for "killing millions." Why are the numbers being shuffled since last year? Why are they now mentioning that a lot of those deaths had "other factors" and COVID as well? Why are PCR test now being recalibrated to lower cycles (after the WHO mentioned that the high number of cycles was creating too many false positives), but no one has gone back to look over past results?</p>
<p>Nothing lines up nor adds up.</p>
<p>And for me, I've spent my life seeing patterns in things (I'll admit, even when there aren't any), and right now everything I don't trust is trying to direct my attention in one direction so I'm trying to keep my head on a swivel and watch all directions at once.</p>

        <p>The numbers change because as the the definitions of what cases count and what cases dont has changed. The flu vaccine isnt developed with the flu you'll catch. They can be developed with other viruses that are close enough to teach your immune system to protect itself from the bad one.</p>
<p>Talked about it with my mom. Never had any of those, but a case doesnt prove statements like this. Vaccines work and if you dont believe the data on it, you should make an appointment with your local optometrist</p>

        <p>"The numbers change because as the the definitions of what cases count and what cases dont has changed."</p>
<p>So the data is faulty since the data is mutable based on definition. In other words, everything needs to be recalculated.</p>
<p>Never had any childhood illness. Cool, and lucky you (not sarcasm). I had chicken pox, and one or both of the other two. I was vaccinated as a child, and again when I was in the US Army.</p>
<p>Why did you write "Vaccines work"? Yes they do. Do I trust the COVID vaccine, and that it works? No I do not. You wrote it yourself "The definitions of what cases count and what cases don't has changed" so how the heck can you write that, but then tell me that the data on the COVID vaccine is "good"?</p>
<p>I have the same skepticism about the flu vaccine so I won't repeat myself. All I've ever noticed is that those who get it feel like shit afterwards, and those that don't do not.</p>

        <p>Those who get it can feel like shit, Im not denying that. Many feel nauseous or really tired. They also die way less from this virus, and if they cant carry the virus they wont transmit it to everyonearound them. The benefits far outweigh the side effects. </p>
<p>And don't get all picky with the data and definitions. The data exists, the only thing that changes are the parameters used to study it. This is the same predicament as categorizing foods, there are always conditions that could place a data point in more than one category. Watermelons are berries, strawberries are not. Theres plenty more but I dont feel like bringing them all to you</p>

<p>Nope. </p>

        <p>Im pointing out a similar situation where categories were established but the rules on them were changed and that made things kinda fucky. No I'm not going to do your research for you, this shit isnt hard to find. But cases change because doctors have learned that this virus causes other issues that can be lethal. So all those old cases need to be reevaluated to determine where they belong now. Pneumonia or diabetes or heart disease were all things that the virus caused to be lethal. These things werent initially known, so many cases that should have been counted as covid victims were not</p>

        <p>I never asked you to do research for me. I do that on my own. Hell, that is why we are having this discussion in the first place.</p>
<p>But your last response has clarified something for me, or the way you wrote isn't correct.</p>
<p>"Pneumonia or diabetes or heart disease were all things that the virus caused to be lethal. These things werent initially known, so many cases that should have been counted as covid victims were not." </p>
<p>Pneumonia, diabetes (type 1 &amp; 2), and heart disease are lethal. This isn't new and has been known for a very long time.</p>
<p>Now if you meant to write that COVID exacerbated those illnesses, and caused them to be lethal "faster" then I can agree with you. But in that case COVID isn't the cause of death, and last time I checked no one can say that they wouldn't have died from those illnesses.</p>
<p>So then the question becomes did they die of COVID, or did they die of an illness and had active COVID in their bodies? I know you'll respond with "You're splitting hairs", but I'm not. One is a deadly virus, the other is just another bug and last time I checked we didn't get a vaccine for all the previous bugs.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Stepping away from the above conversation and the discussion.</strong></p>
<p>I just wanted to say thank you. I know I won't change your mind, nor you mine. But this discussion helps me process. I looked at some of the other posts in response to your original one, and that isn't helping anything or anyone.</p>

        <p>All those things the virus instigates can be lethat if untreated, but they werent lethal. Because those people were living with all those conditions before.if something is tolerable or treatable, its not lethal. If an outside thing makes previously existing issues more serious, the aggressive one is the issue. I don't understand how this logic is hard to understand</p>

        <p>And you just confirmed it.</p>
<p>I'll leave diabetes to the side because that is a different problem, but pneumonia and heart disease is lethal. Period.</p>
<p>Is it treatable? Yes. Will the treatment guarantee you will live? No.</p>
<p>Please understand, I am not talking about COVID at all in this case.</p>
<p>Pneumonia is a inflammation in the lungs, and prevents the transfer of oxygen into the bloodstream. This isn't in the "tolerable" category, this is "you get better (with or without treatment), or you die" category. </p>
<p>Heart disease... I don't understand why you even think this one isn't lethal. The heart stops pumping blood. Another name for it is "Heart Attack". Will treatment prevent it from happening? No, might delay it but it won't prevent it.</p>
