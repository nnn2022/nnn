    <strong>Read this article about Fauci admitting he has lied, consistently, about her immunity thresholds</strong>
    <p><p>Here’s the article (original interview was actually in the NYT, but screw those guys): https://nypost.com/2020/12/24/fauci-covid-herd-immunity-requires-90-to-be-infected-or-vaccinated/</p>
<p>One of his quotes: “When polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine, I was saying herd immunity would take 70 to 75 percent,” he said.</p>
<p>“Then, when newer surveys said 60 percent or more would take it, I thought, ‘I can nudge this up a bit,’ so I went to 80, 85.”</p>
<p>There is no intention for this to end, only for never ending mandates and tyranny.</p></p>
