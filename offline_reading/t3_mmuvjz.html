    <strong>To the men saying "women are more easy to brainwash and follow states orders"</strong>
    <p><p>I work in an entire female employed business and we are all against masks, barely wear them, and its the only reason I have stayed sane during this. The franchise owner, a middle aged man, will watch the cameras and call and scream at people to put their masks on and get away from each other. And no, its not because he is scared of getting his business shut down. Everything is pretty normal and up and running where I am, so this is just him being a controlling maniac. </p>
<p>I understand its easy to point fingers at an entire group, we all want someone to blame or bring fault to something so we feel more in control over our own lack of control. But do not forget who the common enemy is. The elite, the people pulling the strings, the government, who are predominantly men if we wanna go there. </p>
<p>You are literally doing exactly what they want you to do. Blame anyone else BUT THE REAL PERSON CAUSING THE PROBLEM. You blaming women for "being easy to brainwash" is the same rhetoric as "its covid that shut down our business, not the government".</p>
<p>Put the blame where it really needs to be placed. Do you really want to create more division, in the group left that is fighting for our freedoms? Male, woman, black, white, Asian, gay, straight, WHATEVER. We are all in this fight for a reason. When I hear men blame women for the brainwashing, you sound just like the covid cult calling you a racist for not wanting to wear a mask. If men are so exempt from brainwashing, why isn't your entire gender fighting in the streets for our rights instead of being keyboard warriors?</p>
<p>Stop making dictatorship about genitalia and melanin. You are making us look even more like fools. We are against TYRANNY. Do you not see that? Do you not see how serious this is and you still want to blame the hens and not the fox guarding the pen? We need to band together. They want division and you are just helping create more of it. If this group crumbles over GENETALIA, then we deserve to have our right stripped and freedoms taken. Cuz then we are just as stupid as them.</p>
<p>And yes, I read 1984, the author purposely made Winston sexist to represent what withholding biological functions creates in someone's mentality. Like damn, at least read the authors testimony if you wanna act like you know the book cover to cover.</p>
<p>Edit: Not one person who wants to keep touting that "women are more compliant" have mentioned why this information is USEFUL to our cause. If you don't understand why they put headlines out like "men vs women" and "black vs white" to keep you distracted on meaningless things, good luck making any change because they already won inside your head.</p>
<p>Its like the virtue signaling version of our cause; "hyuck I am a man so it is less likely for me to be compliant, im God status y'all" like great job, you're helping us so much.</p></p>

<p>You can say it's counterproductive and I largely agree, but there is good evidence for the claim women are "more easily brainwashed and follow states orders." Denying that reality makes solutions harder to craft.</p>

<p>Because they want to turn this movement into an exclusive club for people who share their values and sentiments, and who toe their line. Political and social tribalism. It's really not different from what the opposition does, it's just done by a different group.</p>

        <p>I totally agree. Tbh it is really popular to hate on women now. It's popular to hate men too. It's terrible really because we need and compliment one another and each side compensates for the others weaknesses when society is functioning well, which it ain't. </p>
<p>I fit into so many demonised categories - female, introverted, desk job... sometimes I'll make a comment about how people who have physical jobs must be suffering and you get responses like "people who sit on their arses all day would never understand". I guess I'll head on out then lol. There's no need for us to divide ourselves further</p>
<p>I totally get that statistically women are probably more likely to follow rules and be risk adverse. Part of that is probably because people who are pro masks love attacking women. If other men were going to leap to our defence, we'd probably feel safer disobeying. It's just a huge mess, and anyone against this is cool with me.</p>

        <p>I agree. I feel like as a woman myself, I’m not as likely to boldly face violent mask nazis because my nature is not to fight with grown men mostly. It’s scary for a reason. Women by nature weren’t the fighters of a tribe thousands of years ago. Women, being biologically less physically strong than men, would not be designed to be really confrontational, or at least AS confrontational as men. That’s my opinion, I know others will pick it apart, but I see the nature of women this way when it comes to mask compliance.</p>

        <p>The statistics consistently show that men are much less likely than women to wear masks and be worried in general about COVID, and men are less risk-adverse than women. That doesn't mean that women are to blame for COVID hysteria, especially since men are mostly the ones in charge of manufacturing this farce, but there is a reason people have this perception, it doesn't spring solely from sexism.</p>

        <p>I'm not concerned about who is or isn't compliant, I'm just pointing out that there is a reason for a phenomenon that you claim is completely baseless. Now obviously half of men are going along with this crap also, but the men who aren't are looking around and seeing a greater percentage of women than men are obeying the new normal, and that is where this incorrect perception comes from.</p>

        <p>I agree women are more risk adverse than men. It makes complete sense given that women have historically been the ones protecting the children and men were the ones doing more risky things to ensure the survival of the group. </p>
<p>I do think both genders are equally susceptible to changing their minds on a topic when presented with evidence to the contrary though.</p>

        <p>&rt; The statistics consistently show that men are much less likely than women to wear masks and be worried in general about COVID, and men are less risk-adverse than women.</p>

        <p>It's hardly a bias, it's a biological fact. It's extremely weird to try and pretend that men and women have the same psychological makeup, and if they don't have the same psyche as each other, then one sex essentially has to be more risk averse while the other sex has to be more willing to take risks. This is where the statistics confirm the obvious, that women are more susceptible to control and manipulation via fear porn.</p>
<p>If you don't believe the statistics and studies that confirm our "biases", then go look at voting patterns. Women will consistently vote for more government control while men and especially white men will vote for more freedom oriented policies and candidates. Whether you like it or not it's an objective fact.</p>
<p>Now I'm not saying all women or that there is no individual, but I think it's also counterproductive to pretend biological differences like sex and race don't matter. Women are more likely to be coerced into the covid narrative, it's up to women like OP to open more and more of their friend's eyes to the scam that is taking place.</p>

        <p>I agree you cant ignore facts and statistics (although we must be critical of those as well and not just blindly trust them). The question is what to do with the knowledge. Don't assume just because someone is of a certain group, that they are a certain way. Don't be an ass to anyone based on their sex, race, disabilities... anything outside their control. These are pretty obvious golden rules most people can agree on.</p>

        <p>You're 100% correct, but the sad fact is that this will fall upon deaf ears. I've posted here on this before, and people would just downvote me then call me a "cuck" and whatever. </p>
<p>There's a lot of hatred here that many of the regulars sweep under the rug or participate in directly. I've seen fingers pointed at women, minorities, LGBT, liberals, Democrats, the obese, the elderly, introverts, teenagers, people who work at home even if they don't want to, and way more. This a huge part of why our community is fragmented, and can't get their shit together to fight back meaningfully. Humanity is full of petty, stupid tribalism. Not much can be done, they're too stubborn and arrogant to admit they are wrong, and change their minds.</p>

        <p>I’m a woman, and I’m proudly NNN and have been from the very very very beginning. </p>
<p>But yes, women are at the helm of this hysteria. Yes they are. There are many strong women out there saying “fuck this,” but the people losing their shit the loudest about masks and vaccines are women.</p>
<p>The reasons are manyfold, including good old fashion sexism where women are expected to, or socialized to (not necessarily born to) do what is “best for the community” and are shamed for doing otherwise. Same goes for fear of standing out, fear of confidently saying NO. </p>
<p>There’s no reason to sweep this under the rug. It’s disingenuous. Women: talk to other women about why you are NNN. Including why this is BAD for society and bad for families and HELLACIOUS for feminism.</p>
<p>Pretending something isn’t the way it is, is how we got in this god forsaken mess. It doesn’t help. It hurts.</p>

        <p>Tell me how that information is useful. You say we need to educate these women, I thought we were educating everyone who doesn't understand what is going on? The pickme energy radiating off this is sad. There are also children more brainwashed then men and women combined, what are we doing about them? </p>
<p>Its the virtue signaling version of our cause. The measly percentage difference isn't big enough to matter, and statistics say men hold more positions of authority then women so it is still more on them than us. You still have failed to identify why we should focus on that rather than making change and fighting against  tyranny. </p>
<p>Just because you're a woman doesn't mean you speak for all women. I have just had plenty of men and women agree with me, you're not above anyone because you have a vagina.</p>

        <p>I didn’t say I was above all women because I have a vagina. I didn’t say I speak for all women, either.</p>
<p>Your comment is hateful and ragey and maybe you are the problem. I don’t want to be “picked.” I also don’t go around blaming women and posting about how this is women’s fault. Look at my post history.</p>
<p>But your weird need for us not to talk about this - not to mention it at all costs - is odd and, again, really ragey. It’s a simple fact. I’ve been yelled and berated many times for not wearing a masks and it’s always been by a woman. I don’t hate women. I’m a feminist. But we can’t run from facts every time they don’t align with how we wish things were. Women who “get it” need support from the larger NNN community because they ARE in the minority. And they also need to evangelize to women who are on the fence, are too scared to speak up, or are being fucking hysterical. </p>
<p>If you didn’t want to dwell on and publicize this documented difference, why did you make a whole post about and then call out each commenter who felt differently? I don’t think you understand how PR works.</p>

        <p>I see so many hateful comments and posts aimed at various groups on here. It's very difficult to stomach. (And I love that there's not as many posts blaming the government aside from the likes of alarming_tension and arctic_gold.) I left this sub a while back due to this. It seems like it's only gotten <em>worse</em>, not better.</p>

<p>Dude, it's fine. Most of us are capable of having more thoughts in their heads than one. We can notice the people at the top doing the manipulating while at the same time noticing that women are particularly easy to manipulate.</p>

        <p>The type of business it is, it has to be all female. And even if I was an angry feminist, it doesn't take away from everything I just said. You sound like someone who just got hurt and triggered by what I wrote so you need to defend yourself and need to justify the insecurity you feel by calling me angry. If you're that sensitive to someone's anger maybe you shouldn't be on the internet.</p>
