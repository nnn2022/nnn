    <strong>Mayo Clinic research confirms critical role of masks in preventing COVID-19 infection</strong>
    <p><p>https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-research-confirms-critical-role-of-masks-in-preventing-covid-19-infection/</p>
<p>New data from researchers at Mayo Clinic found that physical separation reduces the exposure of respiratory droplets and that three feet is helpful but 6 feet separation reduces particle counts to near baseline levels. The findings strongly support the protective value and effectiveness of widespread mask use and maintaining physical distance in helping to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>Researchers measured how effectively masks blocked the number of aerosol particles from a masked source, simulating an individual with a COVID-19 infection, and they simulated the risk of an individual contracting COVID-19, when they were masked.</p>
<p>"We found the most important measure for reducing the risk of exposure to COVID-19 is to wear a mask," says Matthew Callstrom, M.D., Ph.D., chair of the department of radiology at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. "We found that both disposable paper medical masks and two-layer cloth masks were effective in reducing droplet transmission and we did not find a difference between mask types in terms of how well they blocked aerosol particles emitted by the wearer."</p>
<p>"The most common mechanism for COVID-19 transmission is through respiratory droplets which are larger than aerosols and are more easily blocked with masks," says Dr. Callstrom.</p>
<p>"I think we had some knowledge about the importance of masks and there's been a number of studies that have showed masks are effective in blocking viruses, but what's really important here is just how effective masking is when done by both parties," says Dr. Berbari.</p>
<p>He says additional measures to reduce the risk of transmission include frequent hand washing and use hand sanitizer before and after meals, and after removing masks, and honoring posted room capacities in busy areas.</p>
<p>"We found objectively that masks are critically important for protecting yourself and the people around you," says Dr. Callstrom. "If you're wearing a mask, you're protecting others. If they're wearing masks, they're protecting you."</p></p>

        <p>Obviously, to test, you simulate. That's just common sense. It'd be weird not to.</p>
<p>And for observational data, the number of Covid cases are rising in areas of the country who are unvaccinated, don't wear masks as much and don't socially distance. So, that's evidence as well.</p>

        <p>If you are jot willing to watch the summary in the video, nor read the document itself. You are going to miss the point I am making.</p>
<p>for example, in the planning document they are listing the side effects and casualty numbers from the untested vaccine, amoung many other things.</p>

        <p>I love that you're quoting a hypothetical case study as some sort of proof of conspiracy. Stuff like this really makes me laugh.</p>
<p>I was doing a math test once. Two trains left the station, one at 150kph, one at 100kph. Wow, I've just uncovered a conspiracy to slow certain trains down so the rich can get on the faster one. This is proof! Someone wrote it down. Its obviously not just an example, it must be fact!</p>

        <p>Too bad they didn't take into account that non-N95 masks have pore sizes greater than 60 microns. Thats why your breath fogs glass if you hold it up close to the mask.  That aersol is what Covid travels in.  Maybe they could simulate actual reality next time.</p>
<p>&rt;the number of Covid cases are rising in areas of the country who are unvaccinated, don't wear masks as much and don't socially distance.</p>
<p>I'm sure that has nothing to do with PCR testing.  The number of cases doesn't mean squat.  It's the number of severe cases and hospitalizations that matter, and those going down.  Georgia is a prime example.  Only about 40% have gotten one vax dose, only 33% fully vaxed.  No masks, no distancing and our cases and hospitalizations continue to decline.</p>
<p>Go away with your propaganda masquerading as science.</p>

        <p>Seems they a) did emulation and not real public experiment, and b) assume asymptomatic spreading to begin with. Also, I did not find any analysis of concerns involved.
All similar studies I have seen always implicitly assume there is asymptomatic spreading and this kills the trust in any generalizations in real-life settings.</p>
