    <strong>Mask experiences</strong>
    <p><p>What the hell is wrong with people? Just went for a nice hike in the fucking wilderness and people are still masked up. Do these people not understand you have to be in a poorly ventilated area for 10+ minutes with someone who is sick in order to get it? </p>
<p>I feel like a lot of these sheep honestly think you can catch corona from just walking past someone. The most annoying shit for me is when someone has the chin diaper and then they pull it up for the two seconds they walk past me...that doesn’t make you a good person buddy I’m sorry but you’re just an idiot. </p>
<p>The fact that healthy people are being treated as freakin lepers is the saddest part of all of this. I also saw a group of schoolchildren going for a field trip or something and they were all masked in the woods, so sad. The psychological trauma these kids are going to have to deal with the rest of their lives is going to lead to some super weird anti social behaviors and downright hostile social behaviors as well. </p>
<p>If you’re still reading then I’ll also tell you another diaper story. I was at a bookstore with the diaper under my nose, in a section of the store completely by myself there were maybe a couple people there. Out of nowhere I hear “asshole” and turn around to see-I shit you not a replica of the guy from the world of Warcraft episode of South Park, this extremely overweight sweaty dirty and disgusting man called me an asshole. “What did you say buddy?” I said. Right away he retreats a little and says “I...I said your mask is under your nose.” And I go “fuck off dude mind your own business.” “Y-you need to leave the store.” He says to me, I tell him to call the cops but he won’t cause he’s a little biyatch and then he waddles away muttering to himself. How entitled are these people? You’ve spent 40 years of your life gorging on fast food and candy and now you expect me to be responsible for you’re health? This shit has driven people crazy and I don’t know if there is an end in sight</p></p>

        <p>In Ontario last week they put a new stay at home order which recommended you wear masks outside. That very day in went into effect I went for a run and I saw people walking by themselves down the street with masks on. Not even pulled down and then pull it up as I walk by but walking the whole time with it on. One lady crossed the street to get away from me because I didn’t have one. They looked at me like I’m the devil. Meanwhile I’m just trying to keep myself healthy. I don’t need a mask on to prove to you I am healthy.</p>

        <p>I see most wearing them inside, but the occasional person's not, or is wearing a face shield. I actually wear a bandanna almost always (which, according to some people on Reddit, means I'm a potential bioterrorist).</p>

        <p>Don't you get it this is the most traumatic and trying thing they've ever been through lol. They wear masks as a badge of honor for being a survivor, a fighter, it's how they carry the cross. </p>
<p>They resent you because you poke a hole in the artifice of the "danger" they've traversed and somehow survived. It's a welcomed marker of a desirable victim status. They got nothing going lol. I'll be on the train looking at em like where do you think the air you're breathing is coming from...there's no filtering of particulate matter before you inhale you're just breathing harder from whats coming through the sides of the mask... and c02 is also concentrated in front of your lips at dangerous %... that's why OSHA says you cant wear an n95 for more than a few hours at a time.</p>
<p>There's also evidence to indicate that when one coughs or sneezes(major vectors) with a mask on, the viral clusters are actually split up from the pressure of the bottleneck and become more numerous and spread smaller and more contagious droplets further, basically what was a large single droplet can aerosolize after being forced through the bottleneck of the top and sides of mask...</p>

        <p>It took me many attempts over years to get through the beginning of that movie. It felt way too real and just made me really uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Glad I finally sat through it, though. Great watch. Everyone needs to see it.</p>

        <p>I went for a hike last weekend and saw my fair share of people either hiking with masks and pulling them up when we passed them. To no one's surprise they were all millennials.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what to make of these people. Are they actually afraid or have they been so severely brainwashed they think this is normal behavior?</p>

        <p>On the trails in my area, it's usually citiots coming up for a day trip who wear their masks.  Locals don't give a fuck.  Then when they get bored with them, they toss them on the ground like fucking animals.  I have seen so many more discarded masks in the woods this year than any other form of litter, it's gross.</p>

        <p>Haha "citiots"--that's a great word for them.  Never before COVID have I seen such a large influx of people ignoring trail etiquette, littering and defacing nature, and trampling undergrowth with their 15-person groups.  In my local trails, people are freaking <em>painting the trees</em> and nailing decorative shit to them, because apparently they can't entertain their children in nature without graffiti.  Stupid ugly cairns built everywhere, and these ugly "rock gardens" full of rocks kids painted that are slowly taking over the sides of the trails.  And in the creeks they build freaking dams so their kids have a "pool" except they leave the dams up when they go home and the water collects garbage and debris and gets all gross.</p>
<p>And don't even get me started on the "citiots" taking their families up to the mountains for "snow play"...  Let's just say the litter is the worst I've ever seen and the overcrowding is so bad that a few weeks ago there was a <em>ten hour</em> traffic jam on a 15mi mountain road heading up to Mt Baldy.</p>

        <p>re: the 2-second people in the park. Some people will pull it up because they don't want <em>you</em> to be angry that they didn't do it. (They don't really know your opinions on the subject). But it is stupid "af", as they say.</p>

        <p>Hiking is so creepy now. I live in Colorado and hike all the time. Usually when you pass someone you smile and say "hi" or have a short conversation. Since covid, people won't even make eye contact with you as you walk past. And a lot of people will get off the trail and turn their back to you.</p>

        <p>Kind of the same thing, but with “directions” in the store. Went to grab a case of beer today, they have it all blocked off and each aisle a one way etc. Well I wanted a case of corona which is in a separate cooler by the tills. So I walk down the “out” takes me 5 steps from door to cooler to till. “Excuse me miss you have to walk along the arrows” I looked at her and said “so you want me to walk down 3 aisles coming into contact with 4 other people in here opposed to walking 5 feet and coming in close contact with no one?” She responded by saying “well sense your already here I’ll ring you up” 
like most stores the arrows etc just make it so you are spending more time in a place and coming into contact with way more people.</p>

        <p>YES! I feel the same way. I've spent the better half of my life eating well, sleeping well, exercising, taking care of my body and now MY life has to be on pause because people with 2.6 commodities make up 94% of ALL Covid deaths in the USA?! What the fuck? The people "dying from Covid" are not "dying from Covid" they're dying because they're seriously ill from years of abuse to their bodies. It's such fucking bullshit and the lack of personal accountability is astounding. </p>
<p>Why didn't the government invest in campaigns encouraging people to become healthier? Public awareness on vitamin D3? Public awareness on sugar and carbs and processed foods? </p>
<p>I don't wear a mask in public anymore. Ever. Fuck that. I'm done. You could not imagine how many people I see driving around in their cars ALONE wearing masks. I've begun to hate those people.  Ok, rant over. 😎</p>

        <p>Masked hikers in the woods are the only people that give me the death glare for not wearing a mask. I go to grocery stores, cafes, all sorts of places without a mask and no one says or does a thing.

        <p>It's evolved from 6 feet or a mask inside only, those were the "rules" the experts spouted off, to a mask all the time no matter where you are or who you're with.</p>

        <p>I've never stopped to ask someone why they wear it outside 50+ yards from another human but I'd assume it's something like "I plan to be within 6 feet of a human at some point" . The messaging is you don't care if you don't wear it so it's just like the bat signal.</p>
<p>It only bothers me when someone has the nerve to confront me about either not wearing it correctly or not wearing it at all. Which seems to be happening more frequently lately.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I was running and I saw someone 100 yards ahead of me fish their mask out, put it on, and then cross the street to avoid me. </p>
<p>Sometimes I run on an indoor track and the slow-walkers (who are breaking the facility rules already) will scatter like a flock of birds when I come through. One lady will scurry off the side of the track when she hears me coming and bury herself in the corner with her hands by the sides of her face like she's trying to block out the bad air. For all this apparent fear and hysteria, though, they...keep going to the gym where the track is. </p>
<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The fact is that the average citizen is about as smart as a given poodle. It's kind of interesting to actually be able to see how much of the population is legitimately dumb.</p>

        <p>I WILL say this:  the ONLY time I actually voluntarily put on a mask, was last week when we were experiencing high winds, and I was taking my walk in the park.  Experience has taught me that I typically come down with a cold/sore throat when I'm exposed to a constant draft or windy weather.  </p>
<p>Around here, about 20% of shoppers don't wear masks, and the next town over, about 60% don't wear them.</p>
