    <strong>Now everyone is pretending they knew all along</strong>
    <p><p>Unfuckingbelievable.</p>
<p>Now that the truth is being dropped one email at a time, hammer blows to the credibility of every single institution and individual who supported this nonsense for a year and a half, do you think we'll get a moment of self-reflection and humility?</p>
<p>Nah!  Of course not!  </p>
<p>Now I've started seeing other people pretending they've known about the corruption the whole time!  </p>
<p>Ha!  Hahahahaha!  Hahahahahahahahahaha!!  Guys, they knew about this <em>the whole time</em>!  </p>
<p>Now, I'm "crazy" once again for believing people supported these lockdowns!  My goodness!!  Imagine the audacity it would take for these assholes to now pretend as if they didn't just scream and yell and lecture everyone for an entire year.  </p>
<p>It's unfuckingbelievable.  It is pathetic.  It is infuriating.  I am fucking disgusted with these people.  </p>
<p>I for one will never forget what they put us through.  Shame on these people.</p></p>

        <p>Gaslighting to protect the fragile ego. I don’t say anything at work when I encounter someone like this. I’m sure my silence confirms their reality. But here’s the thing. In order to gaslight someone else, you often end up gaslighting yourself, which has detrimental effects on your mental health in the long term. In essence, it’s like pouring gasoline on both yourself and anyone in proximity. They are executing a form of self-harm. They just don’t know it yet.</p>

<p>Phase 1: it's crazy, crackpot, Alex Jones stuff, wear your tinfoil hat.</p>

        <p>Not at my workplace. I work from home most days but I do go in every couple of weeks to meet with my team.  I went in today and after we met, we were chatting with a guy from another team.  Nice guy generally but he's been all up in this thing from the start, today he was one of the few still wearing a mask at the office, even though he's proud of being fully fauxinated.    "It's still company policy."</p>
<p>One person remarked that it's nice that things are opening up, and mentioned that our county hadn't reached the 70% vaccination goal. This guy said "I can't understand why our county is worse than others!  Idiots! Who knew we had so many idiots living here!  Once we get to 70% we should just spray covid everywhere, kill off the morons."  </p>
<p>Of course I should have said something. But I just stared at him in confusion and a little bit of horror.  Someone else brushed it off with "oh that wouldn't be very nice" and that was the end of it.</p>
<p>I should note that it's a pretty affluent area and there are many educated professionals living here. We're on the east coast. Someone I know who's been a Branch Covidian since the first minute told me that in Marin County there is a higher than average number of "vaccine hesitant" people, which boggled his mind because there are many affluent educated people living there. He couldn't believe they were so "stupid". To him, they were superstitious and paranoid, but to me it was as plain as the nose on my face - they were educated, they looked at the evidence, and decided to err on the side of caution. Just what education is supposed to help you do.</p>
