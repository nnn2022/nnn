    <strong>Struggling in school</strong>
    <p><p>Iâ€™m not that academically focused but I usually do try hard in school and last year (2019-20) school year I actually ended up on the honour list. It was so rewarding and I was so proud of myself for getting those grades. I studied often and I was so excited to go to college or university. </p>
<p>However this year my work ethic has slipped. I am so tired from wearing the mask all day. Our classes have doubled in time so it is 2 1/2 hours at a desk. Online kids cheat easily so my honest efforts do not stack up against theirs because they can literally google during the test. I spend most of my time reteaching myself and at this point I would not be surprised if I didnâ€™t make it into university or failed out if I did get in because I have not learned anything since March.</p>
<p>IDK why we have to go on lockdown if itâ€™s hurting young people so much. School is so depressing now and most kids barely talk anymore. I am usually very outgoing but this year Iâ€™ve made like maybe two friends. The teachers treat us like disgusting covid factories and everything is so cutthroat because of the pressure to get into university.</p>
<p>It is so frustrating to try hard and still not do well because I am learning a weeks worth of material in a day and coming home to study for it. Meanwhile online kids cheat. Weâ€™re being forced into online next month and the only positive is that my grades will go up. If we go back to normal next year they will definitely drop due to the lack of any actual learning.</p></p>

        <p>The world is a mess right now, please just try to hang in there.  Things have to get better.  I can't imagine being a kid right now. Things are not normal right now.  Hold onto your heart and empathy because you are the ones who are going to be the ones running things years from now.  You aren't covid factories.  Just keep talking to your friends you do have and keep having hope things will get better.</p>

        <p>Thanks. We do have a lot of fun and I still get to have a pretty good childhood. Even though Iâ€™m in high school we still go to playgrounds/sledding and malls are still open. So sometimes we can pretend the lockdowns donâ€™t exist. I think the future will be better too! I have a lot of likeminded friends so that helps. ThanksðŸ˜ƒ</p>

        <p>College student. Despite trying hard to pass physics, I flunked the Midterm and other tests. I know what it's like to "try hard and still not do well because I am learning a weeks worth of material in a day ". And the worst part is, nobody seems to understand that <em>it's the system that's failing me, not the other way around</em>.</p>

        <p>Dude Iâ€™m so sorry! I donâ€™t think the human brain can actually retain that much info. Itâ€™s ridiculous that they expect us to</p>

        <p>I feel like I CAN learn Physics, though- Iâ€™m just a slow learner who needs more time than others. But the education system is not built to take individuality into account- it is a collectivist system taking a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>

        <p>My younger brother was was supposed to graduate HS this coming May but he chose to dropped out and he got his GED instead. He is already done now and doesnâ€™t have to worry about HS anymore, and it really holds the same weight as a HS diploma.</p>
