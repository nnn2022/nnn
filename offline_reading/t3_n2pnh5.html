    <strong>Have Vaccines every eradicated any disease?</strong>
    <p><p>Article excerpt, Makes you really think!</p>
<p>So what has happened? Where did they all go if their complications still remain (and in some cases are more common than ever)? They were renamed.</p>
<p>Measles has been renamed roseola, fifth disease, etc;
Polio has been renamed Guillain Barre, transverse myelitis, coxsackie, MS, cerebral palsy</p>
<p>(we actually use more respirators today than we ever did iron lungs by the way it is just that iron lungs
were too expensive and dangerous to keep using);</p>
<p>Diphtheria/pertussis were renamed respiratory syncytial virus, croup, strep, bronchiolitis etc;</p>
<p>Hepatitis just keeps on running through the alphabet;
Meningitis/pneumonia/sepsis blamed on Hib was renamed meningitis/</p>
<p>pneumonia/sepsis blamed on
some other bacteria;
Smallpox was renamed monkey pox/severe chicken pox.</p>

        <p>Even the original vaccine, giving people cowpox so they had a better reaction to smallpox, didn't eradicate the disease.   </p>
<p>Vaccines have always been about protecting the vaccinated person.   They maybe lessen the chance of transmission, but I doubt anything ever gets eradicated.</p>
<p>We just adapt to them.</p>

        <p>Smallpox was eradicated naturally by vaccines. However, being as it was eliminated it now only exists in bio weapon labs and we are no longer regularly vaccinating for it. Let that sink in.</p>

        <p>It wasn't vaccination that did it.  It was better water and hygiene.</p>
<p>Humans were vaccinating against it since the 1500s.</p>

        <p>Yes, something called Small Pox was eliminated in 1980, it took DECADES to achieve. We are on the verge of eliminating Polio, it's only left in small pockets in very poor war torn nations like Afghanistan, Syria, and the DRC</p>

        <p>Smallpox has been eradicated.  monkeypox and chicken pox are different viruses.</p>
<p>From demon in the freezer by Richard Preston:</p>
<p>In 1991, the WHO had two hundred million doses of frozen smallpox vaccine in storage in the Gare Frigorifique in downtown Geneva. This was the worldâ€™s primary stockpile of smallpox vaccine. The vaccine stockpile was costing the WHO twenty-five thousand dollars a year in storage costs, largely for the electricity to run the freezers. In 1991, an advisory panel of experts known as the Ad Hoc Committee on Orthopoxvirus Infections recommended that 99.75 percent of the vaccine stockpile be destroyed, in part to save on electricity costs. Since the disease had been eradicated, there was no need for the vaccine. The vaccine was taken out of the freezers, sterilized in an oven, and thrown into Dumpsters.</p>

        <p>By renamed the article is referring to the diseases being all put into ome group, for instance during the polio epidemic, ( a time where there was no internet and no way to connect with doctors internationally) med Guillain Barre, transverse myelitis, coxsackie, MS, cerebral palsy were all classified as polio, they resembled each other, so if you remove all of these different illnesses from under the category of polio ofc it makes it seem as if polio was eradicated when in fact there were many factors that led to its demise.</p>
