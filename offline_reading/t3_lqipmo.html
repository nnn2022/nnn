    <strong>Those who travel by air, especially to foreign countries, see the farce of this “pandemic” more clearly.</strong>
    <p><p>So this is a bit of a rant. My wife and I live in ND. It was sub-zero for the better part of two weeks, so we decided to take a trip down to Cancún with a couple of friends from CO and a group from Miami. Cancún and QROO is under a strict mask mandate. Shops outside of the resort are required and strictly enforced. Once on the resort grounds the mask is optional except for the staff. We made friends with a couple there, one was an airline stewardess and her girlfriend is an attorney from a large city. Neither of them believe in the efficacy of masks. </p>
<p>To my point of this rant, within three days of returning to the states, you must take an antigen test with a negative result. The resort does them for free. Due to our scheduled dive one day, a computer issue the next, and the time of our flight on the third, my wife and I had to take the test at the airport. </p>
<p>We had one of the curbside baggage handlers watching our bags as we waited in line. A quick count had about 90 people in front of us. There was one person performing the test and two people completing the paperwork. Here is where it gets shady. My wife and I each completed a form. The lady filling out the lab paperwork swapped our papers and wrote the wrong names on them. When I pointed this out she put it in the stack and said it didn’t matter. We paid our $17 each and moved to the testing line. While waiting, we watched the tester who was dressed in full lab gown with hood, double mask, and face shield, talk with friends who strolled in and high fived each other while laughing. </p>
<p>When it was my turn she took my temp with a hand scanner on the wall. I sat in a cubicle. She asked if it was my first time and I said it was and that I would like it to be negative. She said don’t worry, people aren’t sick here. She swabbed my left nostril and then the right with the same swab and that was it. </p>
<p>While waiting for the results I asked my bag man how many people he has seen test positive. He smiled and said there are no sick people in the airport. From start to finish we were done in 45 minutes. </p>
<p>Out of our group of 18 people from across the country, there were zero positives.  It is a farce and a scam. The documents you show customs on re-entry is not verify in any way. The fake ones you find online for $25 look exactly the same and serve the same purpose. Watching people in the airports, on the plane, prove how pointless these measures are. Constantly touching their masks, chairs, counters, food, and then their faces and eyes. </p>
<p>The most disturbing sight was in Minneapolis. Waiting to get through customs we noticed a nice new CDC office next to the TSA. They now have real estate at the airports and they won’t be going anywhere.</p></p>

        <p>Some people are, but also a lot of people are just pussies who fall to the pressure to conform.</p>
<p>Nearly everyone I’ve spoken with thinks masks are a joke but they still wear them because of social pressure.</p>
<p>I’m sorry but I can’t respect anyone who doesn’t have the nutsack to call out what they know to be bullshit.</p>
<p>It makes me remember a motivational poster they had in my elementary school classroom. It said “Stand up for what’s right, even if you stand alone”</p>
<p>Apparently it takes a special breed to stand alone these days, but it gives me hope knowing that there are still a handful of people with gray matter between their ears.</p>

        <p>I went to Cozumel in October. The lady at LAX check in was way more of a covid nazi than anyone else at any point in my journey. No one in Mexico ever looked at my “form” that I filled out online. This was before (and after) there were any test requirements. Thanks for the updates on testing because I really want to go back. It was amazing, even with a hurricane. We went instead of Hawaii and Hawaii is going to have to go a long way to earn back my tourist dollars.</p>

        <p>Couldn’t agree more about Hawaii. We have gone to Cancun multiple times over the years and it was the busiest I had ever seen customs. We stood in line and barely moved for about 30 minutes and then we were at a walking pace. They stamped our passports and entry docs without a question and had us all bypass the inspection station. According to our driver they do that so the tourists aren’t discouraged to come visit. It was great!</p>

        <p>They do the nasal swabs.  It made my eyes water a bit like I had to sneeze, but she only went half way up on the other nostril. All very scientific to be sure.</p>

        <p>I just got back from Mexico too and i really didn’t want to come back.</p>
<p>Walking around with no mask and not getting weird looks, most employees of places didn’t care if you walked in without one, and just a lack of doom and gloom....it was amazing. Couple morons masked up on the beaches but mostly everyone was mask free.</p>
<p>Was required to take a test before coming back and It really does seem that 100% of people test negative. I was curious how many money these testing labs make</p>

        <p>I’m confused, are you saying that masks and tests are usesless? That the pandemic is all a hoax? Both? I definitely understand frustration (and more) at the patchwork nature of the US response, not to mention international inconsistencies...but want to understand what the rant is about.</p>

        <p>Yes. It’s a damn joke. From the international response, to the local. Kids play football and wrestle but can’t shake hands at sporting events. You must maintain six feet while in line, but sit shoulder to shoulder for hours on the plane. It is a joke.</p>
