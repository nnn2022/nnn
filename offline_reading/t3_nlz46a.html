    <strong>Common Sense and Logic in Today's World, Has Gotten Sacred to Being Almost Extinct. I'll Tell You Why.</strong>
    <p><p>Have you guys ever wondered, whether it's these PhDs, people with Masters or whatever, how easily they have fallen into this trap and to the bs narrative of the media? While, these people are boasting they have "this" and "that" qualifications, these people are lacking the most basic of things, which is plain common sense and logic. </p>
<p>These people do not have the ability to even comprehend the truth and reality of what's really happening behind the scenes. Their knowledge on health, economy, finances, and the global state of the world is so low that, no wonder they really are idiots. You guys know what's really happening? </p>
<p>While these people are "quad" masking, that Fauci and his crew are laughing their asses off. And they are like, "we got these clowns!" It's very crazy times we live in. It intrigues Me, that how the elite can push their agenda, on top of censoring free speech to advance their NWO in anyway possible. They really never cared about Us in the first place. Remember, since the beginning of time, it has always been the most powerful that have took advantage of the weak, to gain their superiority over us all in anyway possible and main thing they have forgotten morals and humanity. </p>
<p>I'm very grateful for this sub. While, I may not know all of you, we must take a stand and fight together in whatever way possible. We have already been fked, so why not fight together till the end, and no matter what the consequences maybe. This life is too short to bow down to jokers like Fauci and those idiots. If you believe in God, then only you must bow down to him. That's it. </p>
<p>The biggest of the sheeps is the people with more degrees than a thermometer. It's truly a shame. Schools/universities are nothing but an indoctrination camp to brainwash you and submit to their agenda and narrative. And like the clowns they are, while they're flaunting their degrees they are bending over the most to take whatever society and the elite throws at them. And while these universities give them many degrees, it makes them lose the simplest things which is the ability to think rational and use common sense.</p></p>
