<title>Dear covidiots. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic did you wear a mask? Did you locked yourself in the house? Did you stopped going to parties and concerts? Has anything changed in your life even the slightest?</title>

    <p><p>No. You know why? Because the media did not give so much attention to that "pandemic". People died then too. And they actually died BECAUSE of it, not with the swine flu.</p></p>

        <p>Yep. The only reason they focused so hard on it was because we had a President who threw their shit back in their faces and couldn't be bought by either side.</p>

        <p>Nope I wouldn't have been aware. I only knew because I had to take him to the docs. He was 24 at the time so after a week or so he was fine. He got enough rest and vitamins and treated it like the flu. 
My sister said her only issue is she still can't breathe out of one nostril after covid but otherwise she thought it was a joke. She's 35 and had asthma all her life. Most of my family had it as well and they treated it as if it were the flu and my parents are early 60s. They were fine within the week as well. They too thought it was over hyped.</p>

        <p>To me it just looks like two different strains of some sort of flu. My family has the same symptoms you would with the flu. I work in healthcare any patient we saw with covid was labeled covid pneumonia because that's generally how it manifests. Fluid in the lungs. Every person has it differently depending on age, co morbidities, immune response. So like any other disease I don't see the big deal. It's the price we pay to live on earth. Were all susceptible to disease and death.</p>

        <p>If it wasn't a run of the mill virus you'd see people dropping like flies. I've been out since it happened both work and living normally and I saw the same grocery store workers. Same restaurant employees etc. If it were like some virus from that movie contagion you wouldn't need a marketing campaign because people would be terrified enough to stay home. You wouldn't need to tell me twice I'd lock myself up. That wasn't the case here. My hospitals here were empty. I work in healthcare and landed in the hospital myself in July. I was the only person in the ER. Anyway you believe what you want but I'll go off what my eyes are actually seeing and it's not the same picture as you're getting from the media.</p>

        <p>I don't think so but it's because I've actually opened charts of covid patients. Every single one of them were labeled covid pneumonia. We essentially shut down the world for pneumonia. I'll never forgive them for what they did. How many scientists and doctors were silenced. How many people lost jobs and homes. How many people lost treatments to life threatening cancers and diseases. Like I said you can care about your 500k that the media spits even though they came and said they were labeling everyone a covid death to hike their numbers but I know the truth. We didn't lose more people than any other year and instead of fighting me you should be fighting your government officials.</p>

<p>Have you figures to back that up?</p>
<p>I'm confused though. On one hand you say many died because they couldn't get treated yet at thr same time we had no increase in deaths.</p>

        <p>I'm not here to provide you with research. If you troll this sub you can search it and find out yourself but it looks like you just want to argue with people. That should never be the cost of a "virus". It never has been in history and you won't be remembered as a person that saved lives. You did literally nothing. Until you take in those who have been left with nothing you will just sit in the ivory tower and judge. My dad lost his business of almost 20 years to the government and medias response. Not the virus. Hell he had covid and said it was a flu he even got vaccinated because he thought that's what older folks do. I'll never forgive people like you for saying that's the price to pay. Tuberculosis is 100x worse than covid and we've never shut society down. Ebola is 100x more deadly still nothing shut down. I'm done talking to you. You disgust me.</p>

<p>&rt;Tuberculosis is 100x worse than covid and we've never shut society down.</p>
<p>How contagious is it? </p>
<p>&rt;Ebola is 100x more deadly still nothing shut down</p>
<p>A virus that has had next to no traction in the US has never shut down the US. And you act surprised? </p>
<p>Again, how contagious is it? </p>

<p>You're putting words in my mouth.</p>
<p>And you seem to be having a hard time understanding the point I am making.</p>
<p>Once more. You said there was no increase in deaths last year.</p>
<p>You also told me that many people died because they couldn't operated on.</p>
<p>So did more people die or not?</p>
<p>You won't produce the figures so I guess we'll never know.</p>

        <p>Also after I believe it was around 800 people having adverse effects after the “vaccines” (that doesn’t include the long term effects causing narcolepsy and cataplexy) they stopped the vaccine rollout... how many adverse reactions and deaths are we up to now with Covid “vaccines”? 4,000? 5,000?</p>

        <p>Thing is, they can’t post it anywhere public even if they wanted to, since posts which question the “pandemic”just get removed. I mean, I got permanently banned from a sub simply for suggesting that people with health issues which prevent them from getting the vaccine should be exempt from the Covid 19 injection. Madness</p>
