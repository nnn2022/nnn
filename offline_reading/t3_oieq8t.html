    <strong>Ageism is the next manufactured 'divide and conquer' strategy by the ruling class</strong>
    <p><p>In the same way that they used race and gender to pit groups against each other, it's easy to see that they're doing the same thing now with <em>age</em>.</p>
<p>I've noticed even in my own small town a growing 'tension' between the older and younger demographics - older populations are being trained to view young people as a threat (their mere existence is a threat to their survival). Young people are being conditioned to view older people as destroying their lives and freedoms.</p>
<p>And since most of the politicians/ruling class are older, they have the means to clamp down and restrict the younger population to 'protect' themselves.</p></p>
