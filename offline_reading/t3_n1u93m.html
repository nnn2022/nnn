    <strong>Should we question vaccines? The answer is obvious, isn’t it?</strong>
    <p><p>The brain dead think questioning vaccines is simply something no one should ever do. Many Westerners take this stance because they were jabbed without their conscious consent as a child, read and hear carefully crafted - and oft-repeated - propaganda about how vaccines <em>cured</em> diseases (they didn’t), or didn’t have an obvious directly related side effect from having one of the “safer” vaccines. </p>
<p>As a result, most people don’t question vaccines no matter what, often ironically invoking “The Science™️”, when in fact the entire premise of science itself is <em>interrogation.</em></p>
<p>We should all question - quite vigorously - the “science” behind vaccines and whether injecting big pharma (with very sullied and shameful on-the-record past malfeasance) mystery direct-hit-to-bloodstream brews, potions, tonics, and pills.</p>
<p>We should question them <em>unrelentingly.</em></p></p>

        <p>Funny you should bring that up. I asked a Doctor and public health educator who visited reddit on r/vaccinediscussion to discuss the safety of covid vaccines and pregnancy as she had welcomed any questions on the evidence, the vaccines and has great credentials. My question was regarding the limitations of the VSAFE measure used in preliminary pregnancy research that didn't mitigate for the potential of corrupting participant enrollment unbeknownst to researchers by parties of interest, (seemed an odd oversight given the volatile political climate and loss of public trust in leadership and regulation). I also asked how the researchers utilized code string to pull data from VAERS, citing another research article that discussed how lumping data can improve the validity of data pulled from VAERS (so I wanted to learn about lumping/code string word technique that was used in the study). I also asked if she had information on the additional research designs that backed the CDC recommendations for pregnancy safety, and discussed my worries in regards to a lack of federal injury compensation (just CICP that doesn't compensate legal fees) should a frontline mother providing bedside care miscarry in the first trimester, and how I felt the CDC at a minimum should error on the side of caution where data is lacking (first trimester) since risk of miscarriage in general is already higher.</p>
<p>The public health educator and DOCTOR completely ignored my questions... Twice. First time I commented under her chastisement of someone who wanted more longitudinal studies, then the next day I just replied to her main post with my question. I am stunned.</p>
<p>I actually took screenshots, and sent them to the University in SA where she gained her post doctorate and still publishes research. I felt she did more harm than good by offering to provide public education, then refusing to provide it... I was not the only person she ignored who requested the additional designs that backed pregnancy safety. There has been a lack of transparency regarding specifics with methodology, in that a few design articles are shared. Specifics are difficult to locate on the CDC website. I don't want to read a journalistic reinterpretation... I loved research design in college, so I want to look at the actual design. To me transparency regarding limitations is essential to informed consent. There should never be "education hesitancy" on the part of healthcare professionals, especially NOT public health educators! If they don't have the time or willingness to educate they should not make the offer.

<p>Edit: The Doctor has since responded, although I am shocked that as a credentialed educator she recommended I reach out to the researchers in the preliminary pregnancy study regarding the limitations of the VSAFE measure, and VAERS to ask about the MedDRA code string limitations/strengths... She admitted that this appears to be the only published human pregnancy design that launched the ongoing nationwide CDC recommendation for pregnant women to "consent" to participating in running studies (albeit for many women this "consent" is complicated by employer mandation)... I had assumed that any public health educator ready and willing to discuss pregnancy vaccine safety... would have at the very least... rigorously and thoroughly examined the measures and would be able to speak to the measures' strengths and limitations. It's not like there was an incredible amount of competing design publications on the topic! Any woman before providing informed consent, should be able to get informed answers from any Doctor who claims to be a vaccine safety educator... Do we all need to write the researchers then? How is that feasible? https://www.reddit.com/r/VaccineDiscussion/comments/mx3qag/are_vaccines_safe/gwlrejv?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3</p>

        <p>spot on, and well done.</p>
<p>if we are literally being propagandized to inject ourselves with mystery fluid, we should at the very least have every single reasonable question answered with care by the “experts” who are the face of the “outreach” effort.</p>
<p>otherwise, we should be met with understanding should we opt not to take any jab.</p>

<p>This is the only thing that matters in the whole scheme of it all.  Either respect this principle, foremost. . . . or inject me at gunpoint against my will and admit what murderous tyrants you are.  There is no in between, and no amount of pro-vax propaganda can make it right by claiming that the intact envelope of my skin needs to be breached for the greater good.</p>

        <p>The use of vaccines to control the population levels is nothing new. This is from 1995:</p>
<p>"In addition to the World Health Organization (WHO), other organizations involved in the development of an anti-fertility vaccine using hCG include the UN Population Fund, the UN Development Programme, the World Bank, the Population Council, the Rockefeller Foundation, the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and Uppsala, Helsinki, and Ohio State universities."</p>

        <p>Thanks for the post. I always find it ironic that people feel the need to throw in an obligatory “I’m not anti-vax, I’m anti-COVID-vax.” Then they list off reasons like “I’m more likely to be harmed by the vaccine than having any problems with getting Covid naturally.” Little do they know, they just discredited pretty much the entire vaccine program. </p>
<p>The word “anti-vaxxer” has been weaponized against people who do ask critical questions. The (2019?) WHO health summit (which I imagine nobody really watched) talked about how to combat “anti-vax” information, and the part I thought was most ironic is that they <em>admitted</em> that “anti-vaxxers” <em>weren’t</em> misrepresenting the science, and that if they didn’t do something to address their concerns, they would convert more people over to the vaccine-hesitant side. This sub seems to be a really good example of that happening.</p>
<p>Now to apply questions to everything we’ve been told about health. Like why does the USA vaccinate all newborns (whose immune systems haven’t even really developed yet) for a disease that’s primarily sexually transmitted/transmitted through dirty drug needles? </p>
<p>The argument that you’d rather deal with a mild virus than vaccine side effects also applies very well in regards to chickenpox and MMR vaccines. Maybe at the very least, people here will be more in favor of medical freedom for all vaccines in the future, because they finally realize that if they don’t, people who don’t care at all about their health absolutely will try and push things that (eventually) they aren’t comfortable with.</p>

        <p>I think it is very reasonable to be skeptic about these coronavirus vaccines as they have been rushed trough without, it seems, proper studying but trying to discredit what vaccines in general have done for public health is just childish and should only be discussed on anti vaxx sites in the outskirts of the internet. This kind of talk has no business in a civil discussion about the lunacy of the Covid world.
At least I have not considered NoNeNOrmal as an anti-vaxx sub. Maybe I am mistaking.</p>
