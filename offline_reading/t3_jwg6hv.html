        <p>This issue is really turning into a similar matter as things like abortion rights and Obamacare: something that one side or the other has no intention of ever resolving in their favor because it's too valuable of an issue to use as a campaign talking point.  It's why I've told people that the GOP will <em>never</em> ban abortion or repeal Obamacare, because those matters are too valuable as unresolved issues to campaign on, and to resolve them would be to kill their golden goose.</p>

        <p>well, i was in the same place as you, until the lies started piling up .
so where did truth stop and fabrication start?
the way i see it, you don't get to have it both ways just like in a criminal trial, if the evidence is not good it can't be used and these "witnesses" are not credible.
therefore - ALL A LIE - in my opinion .
if you lie to me, you are a liar and i do not believe ANYTHING you say 1+1=2</p>

<p>Not saying you're wrong in what you believe (so please don't take it that way)...</p>
<p>Just curious what you think about the symptom of losing sense of smell/taste?</p>
<p>Everyone that we know who has had it has had that symptom. Someone at my husband's work had no other symptoms except for that, so they got tested for it.</p>
<p>A friend that had it said that that was the symptom of his that lasted the longest. Said it lasted a couple of weeks (his other mild symptoms only lasted about a week).</p>

        <p>certainly didn't take it in any way, in this sub we can have different opinions and not treat each other like garbage.  :)</p>
<p>what i think about the symptom of losing sense of smell/taste - well, when i was a kid you were told to hold your nose so you wouldn't taste the medicine - right, so a stuffy nose or / nasal drip or other sinus activity can impede sense of taste AS ALWAYS. - or- psychosomatic , not saying these folks you know were lying but if you are pounded with the same propaganda non-stop i can see people start to hum along .</p>

        <p>My kids and I got what I just thought were bad chest colds in January. Our coughing was horrendous. Not bad enough to need medical attention, but bad enough that it kept me up all night long for quite a few nights, I lost my voice for a little while and had a couple of instances of gasping for breath bc I couldn't stop coughing. I guess some folks would go in to see a doctor if that all happened though lol.</p>
<p>We usually pass around colds all winter to one another but this time the coughing was a lot worse for all of us. They never got bad fevers, 99 at the highest and I don't remember getting a fever either. I do remember losing my sense of taste/smell for a short time though (just a couple of days), BUT that's happened w/ regular old colds before.</p>
<p>Been wondering for a couple of months if we possibly had it. We'll never know though b/c I'm not going to get tested for anything.</p>

        <p>It’s pointless to get the antibody test be anyway. I got it in June (we both did), and it was negative. The nurses said at the time that was typical because they fade after 3-4 months ago, can’t guarantee immunity, blah blah blah</p>

        <p>There was stuff like this at the end of the first lockdown: "it doesn't mean the virus is over it means there's space for you in ICU".</p>
<p>Except, I never went to ICU and neither did most people. Who is still scared of this after so long?</p>

        <p>So here’s the crazy thing. My extended family and I have been having in home gatherings since Easter. Every holiday and three birthdays have happened. Spread out over this period. One person did get covid and it was a teenager that had eventually admitted to having shared joints with his friends. No one else has gotten sick even after having been around him. </p>
<p>I’m absolutely sick of hearing each gathering is going to kill my family when the last 8 or so haven’t yet even when one person did have a confirmed case.</p>

        <p>My older brother posted that today on FB. I called him out on his bullshit - we’re all flying down to SC to see my dad for early Christmas - me and my older brother from NY and my younger brother and his fiancée from CA. The only reason we’re not doing Thanksgiving is because of ME - it’s my busy season at work and I can’t handle traveling right now. And his in-laws are in a different country, so a Zoom Thanksgiving has nothing to do with COVID.</p>
<p>I hope his friends see his hypocrisy. Negative internet points for you today Phil...</p>
