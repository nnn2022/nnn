    <strong>I'm seeing a few more people starting to use masks again in public places and it's bothering me because sooner or later I'm going to stick out like a sore thumb again.</strong>
    <p><p>I know that there are plenty of people who have more audacity than me. I still have it, but I'm getting worried. You see, I don't have the vaccine, but I complied with the mask mandate (now I wish I hadn't) until it had been lifted in late June, in my state. Now that the CDC has issued its edict (that's what I'm calling it) of wearing masks once again regardless of vaccination status, I'm seeing the mask-wearing creep up again. I saw it today even in the parking lot. I saw it in the grocery store, shopping mall, etc. A week ago almost no one had it on, and now maybe 20% have it on now, and I'm worried that number will grow. So far, the non-mask wearers, as I am at the moment, do not stick out like a sore thumb because there's still plenty of us, but I'm worried about more and more people caving again and me getting venomous looks. I want to be strong about this, even though I wish I were strong before. I don't want to bring up faith here, because it's a secular forum, but as a person of faith, pleasing my Creator takes priority over pleasing people. I feel like this whole thing is a foundation for the Mark of the Beast and if I don't start resisting now, I won't get the necessary "training" to do it later. If the Mark never happens, good, but who knows what society could throw at us. Things are already creepy enough as they are. Is it better to wear a mask so people don't know if I'm vaccinated or not? Most people here would say no, but I'm just wondering.</p></p>

        <p>No. Capitulating and donning the mask now is just screaming that you submit. Symbols rule the world. Seize the power the reprieve from official mask mandates has given you. No going back.</p>

        <p>It takes work to build courage. Next time you are out and around ppl just lift you're voice and say it's wrong to force ppl to wear masks. Just watch their reaction and see some will agree and others will be in fear. Very few may have negative toward you. Just ignore those and quietly encourage the ones you percieve are afraid. Say no really take it off you should. Just do this once and you're courage will grow.</p>

        <p>I’m not trying to sound flippant, but…just stop caring. Who cares if you stand out? Some people already think you’re simple for being religious. I know because I am religious and people think I pray to a sky fairy. Oh well, that’s not for me to concern myself with. I stopped wearing masks before we were “allowed” to and eventually I just got used to being the only one in the store without one. I had several confrontations. Two in Starbucks, one on the grocery store. Starbucks was the employees, and the grocery store was another shopper. I did get mad and flustered, but then I moved on. Those Starbucks no longer get my business. Not like they care, but at least I know I’m not contributing to their bottom line.</p>
<p>If you bend to please others, you’ll eventually break your back. Again, who CARES what people think of you? I KNOW that people around me thought, and still think, I’m a selfish rude conspiracy theorist pig who wants others to suffer and die. I know that’s not true and it’s not my duty to convince strangers. I never posted the black square either because I’m not racist and have done a lifetime of work in under served minority communities . I don’t need to prove my morals or my beliefs or character to anyone. </p>
<p>If you feel like you must wear a mask, wear a mesh or see through one. That’s what I did before I ditched them altogether. I actually got a TON of compliments on it, with many people saying they liked how they could see my face. And anywhere that required a mask didn’t say shit because I was technically following the rules.</p>
<p>I stopped going to places that policed masks heavily. Left my church over it (found a new one) and stopped associating with certain friends. I don’t miss them. I’m moving on with my life. I’m getting married in January come hell or high water and I don’t give one fraction of a fuck about what variant we’re on then. </p>
<p>People were called crazy for following Jesus, he was executed by his own people. Jesus told us that the world would hate us for believing in him. Do I think masks are equivalent to Jesus? Of course not. But sometimes what everyone else is doing isn’t wise.</p>
