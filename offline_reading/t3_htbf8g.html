    <strong>I'm sick of how it's suddenly ok for employees to be nasty to customers</strong>
    <p><p>This is more of a rant, but this is one of the few subs where I can talk to like-minded people (also using a throwaway). So far almost every time I go to checkout at my local supermarket, I have to deal with a nasty cashier yelling at me for breaking one of their myriad, nonsensical rules for checking out. (I'm in a state with a high level of "social distancing" rules.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The two that I remember best was one time where I was standing on the stupid "stop" sticker at the end of the belt waiting for the other customer to finish loading their cart. The cashier barks at me to stand back. I say sorry, I didn't know this was too close, I'm standing on the sticker... She glares and tells me that I just need to wait.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then a few weeks ago the woman directing customers to the checkouts brings me to one of the open checkouts. I'm just standing there waiting again for the other customer to finish loading their cart, but for no reason I get barked at for coming to his aisle. Luckily the woman who was directing me heard this and loudly says to him, "Excuse me? What did you just say to him?" He seems a little shocked (maybe the woman is a manager?) and points out that the other customer wasn't finished yet. She tells him "*I* told him to stand here. It's fine," and gives me a look as if she wanted to say "I'm sorry about that," which I appreciated.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of course most of reddit would cheer for cashiers telling off a horrible, awful person like me who dares to break one of the unspoken rules of "social distancing", putting the lives of everyone around me in danger because I just want to buy some fucking groceries. I get that being a cashier is a shitty job, but a return to basic decency and politeness is all I want.</p></p>

        <p>I worked in retail for about 4 years and I can't imagine mask enforcement being the hill anyone would want to die on. When I got my first job at a big box store it only took me about three months to realize that very few rules were worth enforcing. Management were a-holes when customers were mad and customers were mad when I wouldn't accept their expired coupon. Few months in I'd take any coupon you handed me, and adjust the price as much as I could whenever I was asked. Customers were happy and managment was AWOL. Everyone was happier.</p>

        <p>I've seen it though. As the other guy said, it mainly seems to be those who've made Walmart their actual career who enforce masks and social distancing. No, I don't just mean the elderly workers who might truly be more at risk, there are many young people who seem to be on that "Walmart Associate 4 Life!" path already. Contrary to comments I make about what I would like to do or say, I honestly don't blame them; corporate bootlicking is a helluva trap. When asked to wear a mask, I usually just politely comply until out of the employee's field of vision.</p>

        <p>It came from experience, I‚Äôve worked plenty of retail. There were people who felt like I do, and people who yell at customers for not standing on the covid circle. Maybe they just genuinely really love the big box store, and believe it cares about them. Could be.</p>

        <p>I have to at work, I even had to enforce the mask policy at the opening to our office building as a part of being a manager within the company. </p>
<p>But I was never a complete power tripping asshole about it like my experience has been at other places.</p>
<p>If someone didn't have it on right, I did say something politely. If they didn't have it on and complained, I simply stated something along the lines of "I don't agree with it either, but I did not make the policy, if you disagree with it I highly recommend writing to Human Resources and making your displeasure known." </p>
<p>I literally had to in order to keep my job and continue to put food on the table for my family.</p>
<p>Now, there definitely are some managers that were serious asshats about enforcing the policy, one continuously gets into fights with employees in regards to the mask policy that the police were called. Of course the manager that was dealing with the employees was not disciplined, it was the employee that was. </p>
<p>The complete lack of customer service and deescalation skills in the world is a serious problem, not just in regards to the pandemic but everywhere. A lot of issues could be avoided just by your tone, body language, and wording.</p>

        <p>Spoiler: we never did . When I worked retail, I‚Äôd hope someone killed me a virus before having the energy to give A fuck about their policies. You want me to sell store credit cards to people who can‚Äôt afford it, now you want me to manage a ‚Äúdeadly unprecedented pandemic‚Äù with NO training, no extra pay, fuck yourself.</p>
<p>The people who are acting like this is their moment to finally be in control.. have been working at that register for long enough to know they‚Äôll die there. They sold their soul, and bitching at you makes their shitty life seem important.</p>
<p>Just walk out remembering that that‚Äôs their life. That line you waited  in. They CARE about that. Say a prayer for em and move on.</p>

<p>That's what I keep telling myself when "citizen policing" is all the rage.</p>
<p>You get people who never got to be in charge their whole lives finally being "in the right" and having their "that happened" moment where everyone claps for them.  </p>
<p>This kind of environment is monstrous and sick and I'm half-jokingly considering packing up and leaving the US to find a country with "real problems".  Sure, it might be more dangerous, but there's a part of me that feels that <em>if</em> I really need to be around people who are gung-ho about a cause, it had better be for a cause that isn't supported by every little petty dictator with a chip on their shoulder because they got a sense of power for the first time in their lives.</p>

        <p>Agreed. It's at the point that I will avoid certain stores. I seems to be a reflection of the management and how paranoid they are. </p>
<p>There's one grocery store near me where the staff are still friendly and helpful. They take all the mandated precautions but don't assume customers are malicious and still treat us with respect.</p>
<p>The other grocery store near me treats us like we're criminals the minute we walk in the door. The staff are completely paranoid and take it out on the customers. It seems to infect even the customers who are rude to each other now - the staff just puts everyone in a bad mood. I won't shop there any longer.</p>
<p>I tried so hard to support my local businesses, but there are just some that I won't go to anymore because they're so unpleasant. Luckily for my hobbies, etc. there are plenty of small businesses online with great customer service that I can shop from, so I don't have to necessarily just shop Amazon (which I have a love/hate relationship with).</p>

        <p>I'm working out a scold that basically sums up how I feel about scolders in general.  It's of the bent of "who made you the police?"</p>
<p>I think someone should have stickers made up that say "Mask Brigade" to look like badges, and then hand them out to scolders.</p>
<p>With little inscriptions that say: "Glad you're enjoying the one bit of authority you have in your pathetic little life.  Here's your reward!"</p>
<p>Also: don't be afraid to reach out for a hug and a kiss.  That'll get 'em good.</p>

        <p>Could handing out such stickers count as something like harassment or assault though? The stickers would say mean words, and would require being within 6 feet of the scolders to hand them out.</p>

Customers are not in the store for not that long, I wear that crap for 8 hours a day I dont enjoy it lol.

        <p>They have been nice to me for the most part, I just had one negative experience with a security guard at a shopping centre telling me I'm going the wrong way because you were only allowed to walk in one direction lol. The way she looked at me was as if I was the crazy one, which pissed me off and almost had me cursing her out, but I know she didn't personally come up with this rule and is only enforcing it because it's her job so... </p>
<p>Honestly if an employee is being rude to you do contact the place and complain and also do not shop there again. I'm sure there are other businesses with nice employees that would love to have you.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately the only other supermarket that isn't completely out of the way for me is an "upscale" one. I occasionally go there, and while the employees there are very nice and make pleasant conversation, they charge like twice as much for the exact same pre-packaged goods compared to a normal store. And they have those silly "one way" signs like you encountered lol. Luckily I never had anyone care when I ignore them.</p>

        <p>One of the worst things about this is how it has made people so angry and hateful toward each other. I know that businesses are forced by the government to have and enforce many of these silly rules, but it is all about how they do it. I was screamed at last week because I dared peek my head into a snack bar type place to see if there were chips or crackers at the counter - I didn't want to wait in line, standing on dots with masks on, if they didn't have anything my son wanted. So we left. The next day we wanted to go in a candy store and the woman at the door was very nice: "Hey, we need to limit the number of people in here, that group should be done in a couple minutes, if you could please wait outside and when they leave you can come in." Refreshing to have someone act politely and not just bark orders.</p>

<p>And this is good.  I don't mind businesses running things the way they want to.  If they want masks and social distancing, fine.  I don't object.</p>

        <p>This business is making money, the employee is not. From their POV their getting paid under $10 to deal with peoples shit. It wasn‚Äôt worth the money before all this, now when they see people making more money on unemployment and furlough to sit home, it extremely frustrating. </p>
<p>The other element to this is they are having to work so much, many with multiple jobs just to keep their head above water in this imbalanced economy, they don‚Äôt have time to seek good info. They have time to watch the news, maybe, and they trust that info is good. With that info and making less than $10/hr, I wouldn‚Äôt take anyone‚Äôs shit either. To them, they are only one step above a slave. In many ways, they are correct.</p>
<p>The problems we need to fix is the message and front line workers pay. Minimum wage is a joke and not worth it under normal circumstances</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs not. I know it‚Äôs not worth it. Minimum wage is a joke and not fulfilling its intended purpose. Minimum wage was intended to guarantee that each person would be able to afford a roof over their head and food for their entire family from one wage. To say it doesn‚Äôt fulfill that is the understatement of a century. Corporate greed and lobbying to prevent the raise of minimum wage is a travesty. I completely sympathise.</p>
<p>You got dragged into a fight you never asked for. Businesses didn‚Äôt want to be the middlemen here. Most businesses want nothing to do enforcing masks, but the government created a rule expecting them to be the enforcers of it; and that reality is a (I say this without any sarcasm) poor minimum wage worker is the unfortunate one being stuck with this task. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs bullshit. It‚Äôs bullshit you get paid peanuts at your job and that now is forcing you to enforce this rule and that is understandably stressful. You are being asked to be a mask bouncer, a job you didn‚Äôt sign up for. It‚Äôs bullshit the government handed down this order that businesses are to enforce this mandate. And lastly it‚Äôs bullshit the government is mandating the wearing of masks at all. It‚Äôs an unfair intrusion for a PR driven virus. The issue which should be a medical one between an individual and their medical caregiver has become a political one during an election year. And if you read this far you know what I‚Äôm going to say next, it‚Äôs bullshit.</p>

        <p>This is the best way I've ever seen someone describe this issue. Maybe one day this will change, but for now I am forever grateful for the customers who understand. I hate offending people to wear a mask when I dont even want to do it myself. Well said.</p>

<p>Thing is, none of that is my problem. When they put on the uniform and go to work for a company, they are still representing that company, and their job is to sell me what is on the shelves. I don't care what their situation is, as long as they can sell me what I need to buy and get me on my way with as little hassle as possible.</p>

        <p>You should be more sensitive to the plight of your fellow man. They are just trying to keep a house over their head and food on the table. The being a representative of the company is a poor, albeit technically correct argument. There is no reason you can‚Äôt treat the workers you come into contact with respect. Working for the public sucks, very much in part to attitudes like this one.</p>

        <p>Nobody said that I don't treat retail workers with respect. I'm actually a pretty nice guy. I work with the public all the time, though not in retail (and making waaaaaaaaaay more money), and generally, if you give a smile, you get one back. However, that ends when employees are rude to me. I also tend to take names and follow up with the company about bad experiences.</p>

        <p>See, that‚Äôs the problem. This is where the Karen meme came from, behaviour like this. </p>
<p>If someone is making $7.50 an hour, they don‚Äôt get paid enough to give a shit. At $10/hr it‚Äôs not worth the time to give a shit. That‚Äôs one hour worth of work for a Taco Bell meal for1person. Their life is hard and it‚Äôs not gonna take much for them to have a bad day. Because they might be a little rude is no reason to potentially threaten their livelihood. If they were paid better and ‚Äúprofessional employees‚Äù making the money you describe yourself making, MAYBE we find a common ground, but anyone who is making what most people make who are public facing, it‚Äôs not enough. I get paid as a public face of my company, one making well more than minimum wage, and I‚Äôm underpaid for what I do and put up with. Those making less than me, well that‚Äôs really shitty. Reporting someone to a manager who probably could give a shit less if they are shitty to your or not is kinda low IMO. The manager probably isn‚Äôt making enough to give a shit either.</p>

        <p>I worked in retail for a good portion of my life. There were PLENTY of people who were assholes to me first that deserved to be treated like assholes in return. However if people were minding their own damn business I would let them be and they would let me be and we had a mutual understanding. I think these people that are overextending and caring about the rules WAY too much are afraid of being caught on camera not doing anything to push the fear narritive because it's now partnof their job description. Jobs are difficult to come by these days. I'm sorry these things happened to you. Just know they are acting out of fear. It's still exauhsting to deal with though.</p>

        <p>People use the word "toxic", but if there's one place I will NEVER shop, it's Walmart.</p>
<p>It's the biggest breeding ground for toxicity I've ever seen, and I'm not kidding. </p>
<p>Employees are awful, sure, but it's not entirely their own fault.  Management all the way to the top of the chain is pretty awful to them (and awful in general...management practices in Walmart are documented as some of the worst on record).  </p>
<p>So sure, they'll probably take it out on their customers, who, let's face it, if you're priced for everyone with a dollar in their pocket, you're eventually going to drive out the majority of people who can afford to spend a little more to not have to deal with the kind of environment that Walmart breeds.</p>

        <p>And yet my husband and I are always told by our mothers that we should work at Walmart. Ha! Mind you, neither of our mothers have been in the job market since the early 2000s, and both readily admit that they've never had to fill out a job application in their entire lives. Even if we were qualified to work at Walmart, no amount of money could entice us to work there, especially with the current restrictions and requirements. That said, we have few other places to shop.</p>

        <p>I was a grocery store worker for 4 years. </p>
<p>If you only knew how many times WE wished for fucking decency from customers and how we got treated more often than not, you wouldn't have anything to say. </p>
<p>Have you even worked in customer service ? </p>
<p>Well, right now grocery stores have one of the highest responsibilities right now from keeping the spread of covid from happening in their grocery stores.  Not to mention they have probably already witnessed the following before you even got there: </p>
<p>1.) People not social distancing and an arguement between the CUSTOMERS broke out. 
2.) The manager bitched at an employee for not keeping people on the sticker they are suppose to be standing at. 
3.) 5 customers before you were complaining that this is a hoax. 
Or 
4.) Their sister had covid and has damaged lung function, and everyone around them thinks this is a hoax. And the asshole at the end of the line has to be an asshole and not take it seriously and probably thinks it is a hoax. </p>
<p>If I still worked in grocery, I would fit into category number 1 and probably number 2, number 3 for sure, and I actually literally am living number 4 as a teacher.</p>
