        <p>That's one of the biggest parts of this...  I'm not sick.  I'm not going to change my life as if I was.</p>
<p>Yes, I understand that you can still transmit in some situations when you think you aren't sick (days after feeling better) and in hindsight, I might have done that back in February.  We didn't know what we do do now back then though.  I think <strong>the knowledge of understanding of coronavirus latency is a huge part of why the virus is trending down v. back in earlier months</strong> however although immunity is probably part of it as well.</p>

        <p>This behavior is actually better described as ‚Äúdelusional disorder.‚Äù</p>
<p>A delusion is present if:</p>
<p>-The patient expresses an idea or belief with unusual persistence or force, even when evidence suggests the contradictory.</p>
<p>-That idea appears to have an undue influence on the patient's life, and the way of life is often altered to an inexplicable extent.</p>
<p>-The individual tends to be humorless and oversensitive, especially about the belief.</p>
<p>-An attempt to contradict the belief is likely to arouse an inappropriately strong emotional reaction, often with irritability and hostility. They will not accept any other opinions.</p>
<p>-The patient is emotionally over-invested in the idea and it overwhelms other elements of their psyche.</p>

        <p>So this is much more of a mental illness that involves the idea that they are sick, and will not accept any other opinion. I don't know who is advocating that they're sick, only that measures should be in place to act like we're all potentially spreaders. Again, that doesn't mean we are all, in our heads, sick. This is a disingenuous way to argue mental illness when it doesn't even fit the definition for the mental illness.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I had my new mattress delivered yesterday. The driver got out of the truck holding his mask and asked if he had to mask up. Of course I said no. I saw his helper had a mask and I motioned to him that it wasn't necessary and it was okay with me that he didn't have to wear one.</p>

        <p>&rt;guess as a chronically ill person I should probably avoid the store she works at</p>
<p>Well yes, that's how this <em>should</em> work. If you are in a higher-risk category, <em>you</em> take precautions.  While the rest of us just get the fuck on with life.</p>
<p>Also, when and why did the üôÉ emoji become a universal signal for "I'm a condescending, narcissistic piece of human garbage"?  Every person I know who uses it regularly is a dickhead.</p>

        <p>They said they were "chronically ill", not "critically ill". There's a vast difference between the two.</p>
<p>A critically ill person is in imminent risk of death, and probably both hospitalized and unconscious. That's like blood poisoning or organ failure.</p>
<p>A chronic illness is mostly just a disease that lasts for a large amount of time. Both asthma and diabetes are considered chronic illness for one, and neither are uncommon occurrences in America. A large portion of them can also be entirely genetic, so you saying that since somebody doesn't have a chronic conditions, their opinion is more valid is just entirely fantastical.</p>
<p>Chronically ill people, generally, are still able to function perfectly well in our society. Even the more debilitating conditions, like cancer or cystic fibrosis aren't death sentences provided that proper care is taken. </p>
<p>If somebody with say, CF was to contract coronavirus, however, they would almost definitely be hospitalized, and be at a rather high risk of mortality, especially if they don't live in and area with or can't afford premium medical care.</p>
<p>Given that some amount of social interaction, be it to buy food, go to work, go to school, whatever, is absolutely necessary to survive just by the merit of being in a society, "Just stay home", referring to people with chronic conditions, doesn't work.</p>
<p>Let's imagine that somebody with a chronic condition lives alone in somewhere like New Orleans. They might not have many options when it comes to, say, buying food. If the owner of their local store was somebody like that being described in the image, what exact are they supposed to do to physically survive?</p>
