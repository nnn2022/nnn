        <p>They missed the part where the mRNA in these injections is not purely what they intend it to be. The % of correct mRNA is actually lower in the batches produced for the public compared to the trials.</p>
<p>We do not know what proteins these impurities code for, what genes are affected, how long the rogue proteins stay in your system, or if certain organs are more affected than others.</p>
<p>...or if the proteins the impure mRNA creates are similar to cellular machinery found in the body. This could potentially lead to some kind of auto immune response to your bodys natural machinery.</p>

        <p>Reviews concerns with mRNA delivery/effects and reactions to the generated Spike Proteins. </p>
<p>Recommends studies specifically focused on: </p>
<p>A national effort to collect detailed data on adverse events associated with the mRNA vaccines with abundant funding allocation, tracked well beyond the first couple of weeks after vaccination. </p>
<p>•Repeated autoantibody testing of the vaccine-recipient population. The autoantibodies tested could be standardized and should be based upon previously documented antibodies and autoantibodies potentially elicited by the spike protein. These include autoantibodies against phospholipids, collagen, actin, thyroperoxidase (TPO), myelin basic protein, tissue transglutaminase, and perhaps others.</p>
<p>•Immunological profiling related to cytokine balance and related biological effects. Tests should include, at a minimum, IL-6, INF-α, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein.•Studies comparing populations who were vaccinated with the mRNA vaccines and those who were not to confirm the expected decreased infection rate and milder symptoms of the vaccinated group, whileat the same time comparing the rates of various autoimmune diseases and prion diseases in the same two populations.</p>
<p>•Studies to assess whether it is possible for an unvaccinated person to acquire vaccine-specific forms of the spike proteins from a vaccinated person in close proximity.</p>
<p>•In vitro studies to assess whether the mRNA nanoparticles can be taken up by sperm and converted into cDNA plasmids.</p>
<p>Animal studies to determine whether vaccination shortly before conception can result in offspring carrying spike-protein-encoding plasmids in their tissues, possibly integrated into their genome.</p>
<p>•In vitro studies aimed to better understand the toxicity of the spike protein to the brain, heart, testes, etc</p>
