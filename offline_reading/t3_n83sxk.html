    <strong>I wish people respected my medical privacy.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sick and tired of people asking me if I've gotten the vaccine. Why do you need to know? And isn't the answer obvious? I'm a 15 year old American. I can't get the jab even if I wanted to. And then after they ask me they go on about how painful getting the jab was. Whenever I get these conversations I always get the temptation of saying "Why would I want to take a cure that's worse than the disease? Do you think telling me how bad your arm hurts will temp me to get the vaccine?" but I don't because I don't want the title of a conspiracy nut Q follower. (Off topic but why do people think we're a Q group? We literally never talk about him, Adrenochrome, or Child Trafficing and we barely talk about Trump.)</p>
<p>For all you  from AHS and CovIdiots, I'm not just saying this because I'm an anti vaxxer. I always respected my privacy and I try my best to keep myself as Anonymous as possible. So much so, that even the idea of sharing my face on a public platform makes me feel uncomfortable. I don't believe that people should know nor care about my medical history.</p>
<p>Whenever I look back to prior 2020 I feel like crying. I miss those times so much. I wish I was born prior the 21st century when people weren't so interested to know about your private information. I have the feeling that you'll need to showcase your medical history in order to travel outside of the country in the nearby future. They're going to say it's temporary, but in reality, it's going to be the Patriot act II. I really hope I'm wrong but as the days go by I feel like more and more people are accepting the idea of mandatory undertested vaccine and it's stressing me out immensely.</p></p>

        <p>More and more people are stepping up and fighting ever last evil thing that is going on. This includes powerful, well connected rich people. Everyday people are starting movements that have been rapidly growing combating the particular evil they have decided to fight, such as 2020 election audits or forced vaccinations or critical race theory.</p>
<p>The global socialist/marxist elites have had 60 years to get into the position of power they are in now. We have an uphill battle and we gain more ground everyday.</p>
<p>As for people making getting a vaccine the cool thing to do…keep in mind not everyone is like that. No one knows how the various versions of the vaccine will effect people in the long run, because not enough testing has been done. For some reason those important testing steps where skipped. I keep hearing stories of people dying days after getting the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Hey friend. I’m also a 15 year old from America who lives in a lockdown state, and I’m dealing with the same problems that you are. I also look back on the time before all of this - 14 months ago. I wish I could have that back. These people have been going after me for a while, got kicked out of my home state because of a vax mandate for schools. Hang in there, also feel free to DM me. Wish you luck!</p>

        <p>I don't live in a lockdown state but instead I live in a county with a major city in Ohio. Ohio isn't "free" per say but it's no where as bad as a place like New York. We still have a mask mandate. It's very rare to see other people my age sharing the same view points about this COVID situation. Ty for the comment.</p>

        <p>No problem. I live just outside of New York (Northeastern New Jersey). I also feel great at having seen someone my age who feels the same way. At least you live in Ohio, because my area will be at the tail end in terms of ending restrictions. I do want to demonstrate in my state though. There is a protest that I will probably go to.</p>
