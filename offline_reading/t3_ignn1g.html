    <strong>Just had my first experience with a Karen at the gym</strong>
    <p><p>It was 9pm at the gym and I had just arrived. There were maybe 10 people there spread out over 10k square feet. Before starting my workout, I sat down in the far corner on a bench to write a text and then got up and walked over to a different section. I see this chubby 5’6” asian guy waddling over with his arms out like he’s carrying invisible suitcases. He starts talking to me, so I take my headphones out and the conversation went something like this:</p>
<p>Him: I think you forgot to wipe down that bench you were just on</p>
<p>Me: Nah, man </p>
<p>Him: What?</p>
<p>Me: I’m not wiping it down</p>
<p>Him: (blocks me from grabbing the weights) You’re supposed to wipe down the equipment here after you use it 
(note: I usually do, if I touch anything with my hands or sweat on it)</p>
<p>Me: Yeah, because I have covid on my ass. Do you even know how it’s transmitted?</p>
<p>Him: (pointing at my Stanford Alumni t-shirt) How much did you pay for that education? You should get your money back. I guarantee I’m smarter than you.</p>
<p>Me: Ok, bud</p>
<p>Him: You’re a real asshole, aren’t you (as he gets right up in my face). Do something. Let’s take this outside.</p>
<p>Me: Yeah, you’re terrified of covid, but you’re breathing in my breath from 6 inches away. Dipshit.</p>
<p>Him: It doesn’t matter, I’m wearing a mask (a cloth one). And besides, this isn’t about me. It’s about following the rules. You’re putting other people at risk.</p>
<p>Me: Dude, fuck off. People know the risk when they come here (point out half the people in the gym not wearing masks). If they’re that worried, they can wipe down the equipment before they use it.</p>
<p>Him: 170k have people died and that’s your response?</p>
<p>Me: Other’s peoples’ health is not my responsibility. My health is my responsibility.</p>
<p>Him: What a selfish thing to say. I bet you would come here with covid.</p>
<p>Me: If your health was my responsibility, I’d tell you to go on a diet (as I tapped his belly with the back of my hand)</p>
<p>Him: Touch me again and see what happens. (now he’s 2 inches from my face) We can grab a mat right there and go at it.</p>
<p>Me: Is this going as well as you thought it would? Fuck off, fat ass.</p>
<p>Then he turned around and went to the front desk to complain. They did nothing.</p>
<p>And then everyone clapped. But seriously, this power tripping Karen thought he was going to bully me into wiping down my non-existent covid with their 99% water solution because I sat on a bench for 20 seconds. He threatened to assault me multiple times throughout the interaction. This is our new normal.</p></p>

        <p>Maybe because Karen is a stupid term that's used to disparage anyone you happen to dislike. I'm so sick of people calling each other Karen.  I just feel bad for people named Karen.</p>
<p>If someone's being a loudmouth, call them a loudmouth. If they're being a busybody call them a busybody.</p>

        <p>Damn I saw a Karen just like this at my gym. I seriously doubt that anyone who goes to the gym wearing a mask is able to exercise properly. Security theater and fitness theater. I don’t see anyone wearing masks at my gym and if they do, they literally do nothing, they just wipe things down constantly, walk around, talk to people, do a few reps and play on their phones, etc. Or they take it off in a few minutes because they realized it was too difficult. </p>
<p>If I were confronted like this, I’d probably say, “Dude, stop asking me to be responsible for your health; I’m not your personal trainer.”</p>

<p>But because there's no threshold for how efficiently someone needs to be when wiping, sometimes that happens.</p>
<p>I'd rather have it this way. If I go to use the machine and I'm not happy with how the last user wiped it down, I'm happy to do it myself. The alternative would be to have a wipe-down-police follow the gym users to ensure the wipe down met some certain compliance standard. And thank God that doesn't exist. </p>
<p>Otherwise, we may as well be wiping the seats of every park bench, restaurant, public bus, work place... A bit ridiculous.</p>
<p>I bet OP also didn't wipe down the seat in the locker room he sat down on to change his shoes. Lord have mercy.</p>

        <p>Right, but what's the threshold here? If he sits on a chair in the lobby when he walks in? Sits on a chair in the locker room? A bench for a second before he works out?</p>
<p>It didn't sound like OP ever implied that he refuses to wipe down when he's dripping with sweat, just that he took a seat for a moment before his work out and didn't feel the need to wipe down what amounted to basically a chair in any other circumstance.</p>
<p>Touching a surface, or sitting on an item, doesn't immediately mean it needs to be wiped simply because it's in a gym.</p>

        <p>Yuck I had my first experience being confronted by a pro-masker a few weeks ago. I’m still seething about it. Fucking bitch don’t tell me how to walk my 6 month old daughter in the park!  I’m a fucking doctor for gods sakes. I know the risks of transmitting the disease outdoors when it’s sunny and no one is getting within 10 feet of one another. But no she just HAS to be a fucking bitch and ruin the 1 hour I have to spend with my kid. I usually work late and daughter goes to bed around 7:30. Newsflash I’m not spending that one hour freaking my kid out by wearing a mask in front of her. </p>

        <p>I learned how to lift weights a long time ago and I don't think wiping down equipment was ever asked for.</p>
<p>Sometimes you see some sweat on a bench or whatever, big fucking deal.  Wipe it off.</p>
<p>Presumably if I was that soaking wet I would wipe off after perhaps but it's really up to the next user to determine they're hygiene requirements.</p>
<p>I live in an area with a lot of germaphobes and some people won't touch practically anything without wiping down before which I don't think is necessary but it doesn't affect me so who cares.</p>
<p>We have to put our foot down with this "my life is your responsibility" nonsense.  Personal freedom is what sets us apart from places with miserable human rights but somehow everyone wants to be like China now.  China is asshole.</p>

        <p>Where I am, wiping down benches and equipment (other than barbells and plates), especially cardio equipment, is as much a part of the expected routine as reracking weights. As far as I can tell, it's just what everyone does so everyone does it.</p>

        <p>There are usually signs to not rest on the machines during in-between sets but nobody seems to abide by that either.</p>
<p>I find it funny that they try to have a rule door wiping down exercise equipment yet there is no such rule for toilet seats which are much more of concern in terms of hygiene.</p>

        <p>Don't you love how everyone saying that people should clean up after themselves at the gym are being downvoted.</p>
<p>It's the same as that guy who said he openly coughed on people on purpose to "troll the Karens" a week or two ago got his comment upvoted here. There's a difference between hating that people are impeding freedom and micromanaging others' lives, and people using this as an excuse to be purposefully be dicks.

<p>&rt; Him: I think you forgot to wipe down that bench you were just on</p>
<p>&rt; Me: Nah, man</p>
<p>&rt; Him: What?</p>
<p>&rt; Me: I'm not wiping it down</p>
<p>&rt; Him: (blocks me from grabbing the weights) You're supposed to wipe down the equipment after you use it (note: I usually do, if I touch anything with my hands or sweat on it)</p>
<p>&rt; Me: Yeah, because I have covid on my ass. Do you even know how it's transmitted?</p>
<p>You are supposed to wipe down machines at gyms after use. Always. Saying "nah, man" implies you just didn't want to clean the machines. You should've said, unless you did use it and refused to wipe it down, was something like "I just got here, and haven't used this machine yet, so if it isn't sanitary, it's not because of me". In fact, you are the one who brought up COVID first, according to the way you tell your side of the story. Again, I'm not a regular at gyms, but wiping down machines has always been a thing even before the whole COVID bullshit went down. </p>
<p>That said, he shouldn't have threatened you. But you needlessly escalated the situation when you could have just politely said you hadn't used the equipment, then walked away.</p>

<p>Why would the guy be mad if he sat at a regular bench? Hell, do they even have regular benches for people to just sit around in gyms? Believe me, I am in a location with crazy pro-New Normal people everywhere, and even they don't demand everyone sanitize benches or chairs in public.</p>

        <p>I mean, perhaps you could ask <em>him</em> to clarify, but my understanding was a bench in the corner.  I have seen benches to sit on at gyms. This could of course be a “that happened” story but at face value, it sounds like the guy was completely unjustified.</p>

        <p>Not really. It’s YOUR responsibility to wipe down any machine that you plan to use, regardless if you know if it was wiped down before. Otherwise you’re claiming that other people are responsible for your own health, which is false. That’s why any credible gym provides a spray bottle and a pile of small towels around the machines.</p>

        <p>You are supposed to wipe down the machines yourself after use. That's what I've always been told at the gyms I've gone to. Obviously, you have the choice to clean it before use, but people are supposed to wipe the machines down anyhow.</p>
<p>I find it laughable that people here are denying this here, just so they can "stick to the Karen". Wiping down gym equipment was always a thing, even before this. Reddit even bitched often about people who didn't clean their gym equipment after use at various subs before this.</p>

        <p>Wow, you clearly have never gone to gyms before.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/gym-etiquette-101/">According to articles on the subject, like this one...</a></p>
<p>&rt; Cleanliness should be a given when sharing equipment, right? I’d hope so, but we’ve probably all seen the person who doesn’t use a towel and/or leaves a big sweaty puddle on the bench before they run off. This is gross.</p>
<p>&rt; Don’t be that person!</p>
<p>&rt; Use a towel (or bring one if one isn’t provided), and be sure to wipe down all surfaces your skin touches when you’re done with the equipment.</p>
<p><a href="https://montrealgazette.com/life/fitness-nine-ways-to-clean-up-our-gym-etiquette">Here</a> is another article about that.</p>
<p>&rt; Workouts are sweaty endeavours that call for wiping down machines, mats, balls, weights and benches after use — particularly during flu season. But that’s not the only chore you’re expected to perform.</p>
<p>Oh, and to respond to your snide "If you're so worried about germs, clean it yourself before you use it.": yes, you should wipe down before use, but it's supposed to be common courtesy (and even often in the rules for many gyms) to clean the machines after using them.</p>

        <p>Yeah, my 20 years of experience being a member at over a dozen gyms doesn't mean anything because of some blog posts. Anyway, I'm not saying you don't need to wipe up sweat. That's great to do. But there is no reason to wipe down everything you touch. It's all for show. That soapy water isn't disinfecting anything.</p>

        <p>Not defending him, but I don’t think he threatened to assault you. He said he wanted to fight you which is a somewhat important difference.</p>
<p>That being said, good for standing your ground. I might have reasserted that you were only suiting on it for a second</p>

        <p>Just like an ignorant idiot might respond.  It's just plain good hygiene and a good idea to take precautions to any spread of germs. Not to mention it's gross and disgusting to "refuse " to wipe down the machine your sweaty body just hopped off of. Let me guess. You love Trump and friends too. Unfortunately it's become political. Because stupid people refuse to just act with common sense because somehow they think they're owning the libs. In actual reality they're owning their own stupidity and nothing more.</p>
