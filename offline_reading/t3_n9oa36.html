        <p>Substatement - alex jones (and most conspiracy theorists) went from pushing against the militarization of the police.. from radio wave weapons' on the public to police not following the constitution , to being a boot lickers... somehow the media has warped both sides to hate each other... half support the militarized cops (that are &amp; will just following orders ðŸ˜‰) the other half support a dictator like rule over the US (including censorship, cancel culture and more).. it sure seems like the final plan is here.... they got what they wanted.. a public that is fighting each other instead of fighting the real enemy... we went from occupy wallstreet to hating your neighbor thats just doing as bad as you.</p>
<p>bill cooper was right... alex jones sadly sold everyone out for trumps approval and ratings.. and now were stuck in a society where big tech has us all by the balls... with the lock downs &amp; the drills in major cities it sure seems like the end game is coming</p>
<p>i think it will only get worse from here.. because we all know how hard it is to get your rights back once they take them</p>
