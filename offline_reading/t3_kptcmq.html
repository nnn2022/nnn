    <strong>Happy Groundhog day!</strong>
    <p><p>Once again, cases are SOARING, the NHS is facing a bed shortage CRISIS and Boris was interviewed on TV saying he's "reconciled" with having to impose tougher restricions; meaning he'll dither for a few weeks, before the demon headmaster &amp; his mate join him to announce tier 58 to combat the SURGE, justified by incomprehensible graphs, with grossly exaggerated numbers.</p>
<p>And then, right on cue, came the call for a NATION WIDE LOCKDOWN in the UK by Labour.</p>
<p>So what's the public's opinion, this time around? Seemingly very much the same as it was in March/November/December - person A = anti lockdown, person B = makes no attempt to consider perspective and results to trivialisation/ personal insults.</p>
<p>Yes, why indeed would you be frustrated after almost a year? Just wear the holy mask a little longer, at all times, even when showering and wait for the almighty vaccine. In the mean time sit indoors and regurgitate the same tired talking points over and over, whilst doubling down and becoming increasingly dogmatic in the face of conflicting evidence.</p>
<p>This global circlejerk has made the world go blind.</p>
<p>How can the staggering incompetence &amp; myopia of health advisers &amp; government worldwide continuously be glossed over in favour of a lazy dig at the neighbour?</p>
<p>Why is it that a society &amp; culture built off of the back of individual reponsibility now has to carry a collective burden?</p>
<p>Who ever thought to ask Gladiys if it was ok to use her as a political tool whilst she goes insane from isolation? (If you're in Canada she's already probably euthanised herself)</p>
<p>TL;DR: Media, "social" or otherwise is shit and people who wear masks outdoors are freaks.</p></p>

        <p>Labour want to destroy everything and blame Boris because they want political power not what is best for Britain. Also if they can destroy everything then they can rebuild with marxist utopia ideals.</p>

        <p>i saw a thing the other day about how the population of the UK is up 44% since 2000 and the amount of hospital beds  have been decreased 33% over the same time</p>
<p>is it failure to plan or planned 'failure'?</p>
<p>i think the latter, as that gives them the claim of 'overwhelmed' NHS as pretext to lock down and rest of it, forever</p>
<p>their 'failure' at delivering health services paid for at gunpoint, as been a huge success for tyranny</p>

        <p>I don't know, allegedly we were supposed to be selling off the NHS to Donald Trump and the US at one point.</p>
<p>I genuinley believe Matt Hancock for example thinks he is doing the right thing, he dosen't have the capacity to truly comprehened the negative effects of his actions in my opinion. And Boris? He's a populist, he wouldn't want the disbanding of the NHS on his legacy.</p>
