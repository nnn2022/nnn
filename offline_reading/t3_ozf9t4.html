    <strong>Hey Australians, we are a weird country</strong>
    <p><p>We always got labelled the lucky country etc our beaches are talked about, and the cool animals, attractive women, cool outback tough guys, the anzac spirit and anthem that says 'for we are young and free'.</p>
<p>These positives are drilled into us so much that we forget how dark our past really was.</p>
<p>Maybe the big boys in the world have had plans for us for a while but had just put us on ice until we caught up haha. I realise I'm just throwing shit out at the moment but its interesting to ponder.</p>
<p>Think about it, We were a purposefully built prison colony. They literally arrested the poor for stealing bread as an exuse to excommunicate tham to their fun slave island civ game. Then Tasmania was the hardcore part of the game. </p>
<p>Port Arthur Prison literally ran experiments on how keeping people in isolation fucked with them (its on the tourist signs so its not like its hidden this was in the late 1800s early 1900s). As Tasmania was a small island they had the perfect natural wall to stop long term escapes and actually lined the beach with heavy barrells and dogs on chains at each one used as defence and alarm if someone got that far. All of this without even mentioning the genocide of most of the indigenous population.</p>
<p>America tried to take out Gough Whitlam in the 70s for getting too progressive (actually nice progressive, promoting the arts, education, healthcare and free thinking movements). And the state I live in was one of the first to use hard lockdowns in the world with covid.</p>
<p>I think we have been bunny rabbits for quite a long time. </p>
<p>I remember hearing something about our cities being used for social experiments on other occasions for studies as we had a good demographical size and were multicultural etc but that could be myth.</p>
<p>Anyway happy Saturday lolz.</p></p>

        <p>American, sending my good vibes to you all. Hopefully you guys can fight back. It all looks beyond fucked up over there. Actually had plans to come visit in the near future, but thatâ€™s not looking well ðŸ˜¢</p>

        <p>True, although I have to push back on the "lucky country" part. I always thought of Australia as a nightmare realm filled with venomous bugs and snakes. :) <br>
That said, it's still a pretty cool country or, rather, <em>was</em> a cool country. It don't look so great right now... </p>
<p>Also, China has a really creepy obsession with you guys, so watch out for that too.</p>

        <p>China has been breathing down our necks since as long as I can remember. We are literally a pawn stuck between China, and the US along with many other commonwealth countries- for all I know China and America are working together to make us slaves to both in fear one of our more powerful parents will punish us.</p>
