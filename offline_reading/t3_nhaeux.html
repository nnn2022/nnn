    <strong>The Covid Woke and The Covidquisition</strong>
    <p><p>Some extreme groups have emerged which claim to be on the "side of science", but are nothing more than misguided and very afraid people who follow a philosophy that never existed before at this scale.</p>
<p>These are what I call the "Covid Woke".</p>
<p>They claim to be for "saving people", and "care about others", but their actions are more akin to those of religious zealots that believe that their path is the correct one that will lead to salvation.</p>
<p>Their goal is the complete eradication of COVID-19 from the face of the planet, and they are willing to do almost anything to archive this goal.</p>
<p>These people believe that SARS-CoV-2 isn't just a virus that for the most part affect just certain parts of the population, the so called vulnerable, but that EVERYONE is at risk of dying or getting very ill of COVID.</p>
<p>Talking about numbers, statistics and math's do not work with these people, because they always have some irrational retort to these points, by implying that if there is any chance of dying from COVID then you are also vulnerable, and that saying otherwise means you don't care about those who die and are not on the "vulnerable" category, and that we must fight for them and destroy Covid forever.</p>
<p>As any religious cult, specially those that claim to be grounded on science, are mostly grounded on a half understanding of science, and applying their own ideas to this understanding, while ignoring or denying any scientific ideas that would deny their beliefs.</p>
<p>They also operate in a sound bits basis, saying the same kind of words even if they aren't true or do not make any sense, and many times are misrepresentation of things that experts do say, but in a different context.</p>
<p>"We must avoid new variants", "New Zealand and Australia eliminated COVID", "That's why Covid has not been stopped", "You are why there are new variants appearing", "Wear a mask even if vaccinated", "Herd immunity will not be archived", "There is a new deadly variant", "Vaccines do not work with variants", and so much more.</p>
<p>For these people, there is no end until there is no more Covid, and in order to do that, we must double in our efforts, and be more aggressive. Mandatory vaccination, extremely strict lockdowns, mandatory masks, no travel, no going outside, etc., and to continue this until we can confirm that SARS-CoV-2 has disappeared.</p>
<p>If the world do not goes their way, then they start The Covidquisition, in which they start to blame whoever is in front of them for society evils, that for the most part are nothing more than they themselves getting anxiety from thethoir own beliefs.</p>
<p>The scary part is that, even though these people are a minority, just like with the left wing "woke", their moral crusade has infiltrated many influential groups, and their Covidquisition has actually been extremely effective, specially in influencing public policy, and the way the narrative moves.</p>
<p>Please be aware, the way the narrative from the Covid Woke has moved in recent months, they are calling for an indefinite continuation of pandemic restrictions, and never been able to actually "go back to normal", because in their view, normal is what Covids feeds of, and we cannot allow that.</p>
<p>We have one of the most effective vaccines in the story of vaccination, and they are saying that vaccines are not enough, and that we must "complement" vaccines with other restrictions, because, once again, they are looking for the complete eradication of Covid, which is a position that most experts say is imposible for these kind of lower respiratory virus, so in their misguided religion, even though they believe they will bring the "end of Covid", what they are really bringing is the end of the modern era, and the start of a new type of health based dark ages.</p></p>

        <p>In my area, everyone is posting in angry fear over the new mask “rules.” </p>
<p>VACCINATED? You can go mask free
UNVACCINATED? You need a mask</p>
<p>This is how the comments always go:</p>
<p>•BUT HOW WILL WE <em>KNOW</em> THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VACCINATED? :::clutches pearls:::</p>
<p>-I know <em>right?</em> You know those people who are anti-vax, are the same people who have been anti-mask this entire time!!!</p>
<p>Me: Sooooo, basically nothing changes. The only change, is that <em>you</em>, who have chosen to get vaccinated, can rest assured that you are “protected”. We all know that you will continue to mask up and stay home anyways. Why tf do you care?</p>

        <p>It's kind of crazy how this wing of the Democratic party runs the show even though Biden winning the primary was a clear rejection of that ideology.</p>
<p>I'd guess their political instinct is better than mine though and that the data shows that the younger generations will end up winning them elections as long as they continue to signal wokeness to keep people energized enough to vote because I'm sure they are worried that the youth vote will drop down to typical levels without Trump around to rile people up.</p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if they let him back on Twitter as a way to energize the base for a bit at some point.</p>
