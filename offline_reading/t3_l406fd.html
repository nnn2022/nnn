    <strong>How to deal with friends that are sheep?</strong>
    <p><p>I have two friends of 15+ years that are acting like total sheep. </p>
<p>One was not allowed to go to his mom's for Thanksgiving, yet his brother was allowed. The reasoning is that the brother is "basically quarantined" except for the fact that he goes to stores and runs errands weekly, no different from my friend. My friend is being treated like a leper by his family and seems to have no problem with it. Today he is hosting a "socially distanced" engagement party for his college friend. Outside, of course, in Washington DC where it's going to be 40 degrees. </p>
<p>The other one got married in October with masks. I did not attend because I refuse. And he can't wait to get his vaccine. When I told him I'm skeptical of this vaccine he said "it's been in development for 10 years" which is not true. I confessed that my political leanings have changed since 2020 and he goes "you're not on Parler, are you?" with a snide attitude.</p>
<p>I try to approach them with empathy and compassion and remember that they're coming from a place of fear. I try to stay strong and not succumb to "conquer and divide" tactics. I try to gently ask them questions that eventually they might see the hypocrisy of the MSM and social media, but it's getting tedious. </p>
<p>Does anyone have a similar situation? How do you cope?</p></p>
