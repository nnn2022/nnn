        <p>So guess what the fuck that means? It does not matter if someone else gets the vaccine, you will only get the vaccine to protect yourself. I wish all these vaccine warriors would shut their pipe now and stop trying to degrade people saying your killing their nan if you don’t get it.</p>
<p>How do the vaccine companies and ‘top scientists’ not know this by now after the ‘idiots’ in here have been know that for months. Suspiciously enough all this mutating started happening after the vaccine rollout which was predicted by Dr Geert who was labelled a quack after spending his whole career as a regarded doctor.</p>
<p>Edit: it’s good to see stuff like that actually being said because I bet it will be on hardly any news channels in US or UK as it will go against the narrative and makes the push for vaccine passports invalid.</p>

        <p>My prediction is that compliance will not equal freedom. In fact, they're gong to be bound to even more dependencies than we are. With this and Lambda, who knows what's around the corner for them. They'll have a foreign/dangerous substance in their bodies with nothing to show for it.</p>
