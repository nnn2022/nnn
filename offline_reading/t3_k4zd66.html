    <strong>Filming anti-maskers</strong>
    <p><p>There's a video going around where someone refusing to wear a mask was filmed and everyone shames them. I can't understand the logic of people that do this. People who won't wear a mask are "selfish, evil, &amp; deserve to be shamed", but people that take a video of someone secretly and probably against their will are "heros"????</p></p>

        <p>Or just don’t film people in public? I totally oppose mask mandates but I put up with it because I don’t want to get filmed in public. I’m on your side but not everyone who wears a mask is doing so because they’re a virtue signaling douche. Personally I just don’t want to get fucked with.</p>
<p>If someone is filming you for not wearing a mask though, by all means go for it.</p>

        <p>I completely agree with you. When did society devolve so much that people think this is okay? I posted this opinion recently on a video of someone in my city refusing to wear a mask and got over 100 downvotes. All I said was that regardless of your personal opinion on masks social shaming is an ineffective tool to achieve anything. The amount of angry responses was alarming. I was told “this is how we deal with people now.” Utter garbage.</p>

        <p>I had anxiety about the idea of getting filmed in public even before all this. I hate the fact that everyone has a camera in their pocket now and people are eager to put everything on the internet. It just makes me paranoid, even though I’m friendly and polite and have never given someone a reason to do it. I’m also a smartphone user but I have never once taken a picture or video of strangers. Only my friends and family when we were doing something fun and they knew I was doing so.</p>

        <p>Struggle Sessions:</p>
<p>Struggle sessions were a form of public humiliation and torture used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at various times in the Mao era, particularly during the years immediately before and after the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and during the Cultural Revolution. The aim of struggle sessions was to shape public opinion, as well as to humiliate, persecute, or execute political rivals and those deemed class enemies.[1]</p>

        <p>This is why we don't deserve phones. Don't care what the issue is, filming people without their consent and posting it online is abuse. Unless its someone who is committing a crime which then by all means do. Don't turn people into criminals. Back when i was younger i remember thinking one day phones are going to get out of hand.

        <p>Lol,  this comment, right below the one about communist oppression made my day.</p>
<p>If there's a public safety mandate, enforcing wearing a mask, not wearing one is technically breaking the law. I don't think it should be. But until someone sues and wins a lawsuit against a governing body under freedom of expression or speech, it unfortunately is. Kind of the way the system works. They tell us the laws and we have to fight for years and years and often get arrested in the process just to have a judge tell us no 100 times and then yes once. Check the name for my source.</p>

        <p>Simple, around a third of the population has always been human garbage, a third good, and a third inbetween. When the powers of the state incentivize snitching, informing, and bullying at least a third will jump to it immediately and another third will passively go along. Because they lack actual morality, they hold strongly to societal morality, and instead of being good on a fundamental level they are good in a way that will win them social approval. Which is why they tend to make such a big show of their goodness, either by "virtue signaling", gleefully shaming noncomformists, or other obnoxious exercises in power.</p>

        <p>Alright, so do I think the Chinese government created Covid19 either by accident or on purpose as a method of population control for themselves and/or a certain competitive country that rhymes with Lyndia, without any doubt.</p>
<p>but we can probably assume covid is actually a virus, and virus particulates can be somewhat stopped by barriers. So while I don't think most masks are going to do anything for some depending on the mask and the ability to use it properly, I do think personally, wouldn't it just be easier and healthier for you to wear one? I mean, even covid assure, just to not get sick for any number of contagious diseases.</p>
<p>We probably shouldn't shame people for it, because it's a personal choice, but it's also a personal choice that can have incredibly hazardous outcomes on the safety of the public. So by not wearing one, you could potentially be putting others at higher risk levels. I don't think these people should be shamed at all, but taught that it's important we become united on the front of defeating the Chinese population control virus.</p>
<p>It's not like it's actually difficult for anyone, even with breathing problems. I believe, as someone with asthma who smokes regularly. But honestly I wore a mask in flu season in the years past because I hate getting sick and I don't trust the flu shot "vaccine", every year I've gotten it, I've gotten the flu. Every year I don't and I just wear a mask I never get sick.</p>

        <p>No one is debating it was done well, just intentionally. And I mean, it's not like WE made it. It probably wasn't the kind of virus they wanted to make. But isn't it kinda weird how it's symptoms can be so varied based on blood type and less so based on another blood type? </p>
<p>I don't really think you know what a shill is, I'm saying that I agree people shouldn't be shamed for a personal choice involving thier own bodies, I'm just saying I personally have been wearing a face mask every year since H1N1. And if you took a good look, this "pandemic" was inevitable. </p>
<p>I think it's weird that alot of y'all think the virus just doesn't exist. </p>
<p>Just saying which seems more plausible</p>
<p>A. A  communist global superpower had an accident while attempted to creating a new form of biological warfare.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>B. The entire global new media is perpetuating a lie that would involve countless coroner's, medical practitioners, politicians, and virile pathologists.</p>

        <p>That's fine by me. You do you. I work in food service and have faith in my immune system and have O blood type so I'm not worried about myself dieing from it. I've had three cases where I was exposed to someone very sick(my gf works in the health care field), with two positives, one is which I believe was a false positive. </p>
<p>I don't think all the news is being completely honest about the numbers either. But I already wear a mask in the winter, so I personally don't see the harm or the cost of doing just the bare minimum. I also don't really see it as a burden to my personal freedoms since it's literally something that benefits me. I'm not trying to change your mind, but .2% of 8 billion people is still 1.6 billion people that's could die. If a small piece of fabric can prevent even one death(especially mine), it's a good idea.</p>
<p>Again I don't think it was the weapon they wanted to use, I think they were trying to make a population control bioweapon and whoever patient zero was was an accident. It's not like they're known for safety when it comes to LITERALLY ANYTHING.</p>

        <p>Hey, survival date is 99.95% if you're 75 or under AND the average of death is above the average life expectancy AND in Africa people have generaly a stronger immune sysytem and suffer less from autoimmune diseases. Your assumptions are wrong and mathematically impossible. We also know how they're labeling covid deaths which in reality makes the IFR much lower.</p>

I only assumed he was correct for the sake of the debate, even though I didn't really believe it. And to be honest I don't believe the death rate is .05 either, but wow telling me my assumptions are wrong and then claiming africa, the most heavily HIV(an autoimmune disease) has a strong immune system? </p>

<p>Speak for yourself. We don't wear masks where I am thankfully, but I couldn't wear one at all. "Breathing difficulties" aren't the only health reason either. Just because you don't find it difficult with asthma and smoking doesn't mean others don't.</p>

        <p>It might be for you but just because you feel that way doesn't mean the debate is over. to say but that doesn't elaborate enough on the situation going on, youre free not to wear one and it's probably a violation of your freedoms of expression and speech to be forced to wear one, but at the same time that doesn't mean you're free from the criticisms. people have the right to shame you because you're kind of being an inconsiderate person. But It very well could be well within the courts power to force people to wear masks in public, because unfortunately personal freedom ends where public safety begins.</p>
