        <p>This gene therapy experiment has gotten totally out of hand because of propaganda and fear mongering half the population is so scared they will be locked up forever they blindly taking part in experiments with little or no investigation on their own just from CBC  to 
remains to be seen if any of these gene therapy’s are authorized after the emergency use authorization is over there is definitely not enough information on long term effects and there has been no study on animals we the people are the experiment at the behest of the government please read everything on this therapy then go back and read it again if you don’t understand it ask other people  use medical journals and please remember just because it’s on CBC news and being spewed by government heads DOESNT mean it’s true  I have noticed that suddenly everyone is a expert these days on virology even my family dr whom I haven’t seen in over a year asking me to come for the shot they clearly were upset when I said you know I have cancer lymphoma( MZL it’s blood cancer ) and I want to confirm with my cancer  oncologist and hematologist dr if I should even consider it  MY oncologist recommended to me that he will reevaluate that question in three months I have a friend who also has MZL lymphoma who recently had a stem cell transplant he has also been told they will re-evaluate that in three months as it would cause  his stem cell transplant to be rejected we are in different stages of the cancer his being worse than mine I’m thankful I didn’t go to my family dr when they called they asked if I wanted to talk to the nurse in the office I asked if she was a cancer nurse or if training was more for general nurse I knew already that she has no specialty so I said no I felt uneasy as they had called me twice and seemed to be very pushy my husband also go two calls and yes he also has health conditions we both declined the family’s drs offers  I feel like no one Is really looking individually at people’s health problems  I’m not up to playing Russian roulette with mine we were both offered astra Zeneca two days after they came out with usage to people over 70now I think it’s down to 50 then any age now we are 63 and 66</p>
