        <p>I heard people saying that the death count is actually deaths with covid but it was always just a rumor until I randomly decided to look at the CDC website myself and saw this. They are not even trying to hide it. The crazy thing is I've tried to show this to people and I get called a conspiracy theorist. It literally says its "All Deaths Involving COVID-19". If they meant deaths FROM covid-19, then they would write that! I have been losing my freaking mind for a month arguing with people about this. </p>
<p>Also as a side note I'm glad I found this sub! I live in commie-fornia where were not allowed to do anything and everyone wears masks even when they are outside by themselves. I am happy to finally find my people</p>

        <p>Loool yes really. I was digging around their website forever trying to make sure I got all the info correct for anyone trying to punch holes in my argument. One thing I found is that when they say "presumed" it means they had a positive covid test somewhere like CVS or something but they didn't do another test to confirm. So its not quite that they are just slapping covid diagnosis without a test (although I would not be surprised if they are, I just don't have any evidence for that). However, if you look at what the code U07.1 is defined as (the code denoted in both screenshots), it is the code for all covid cases, even asymptomatic ones. So yeah, if you die in a car crash but just had asymptomatic covid, you will still get the code U07.1 and be included in the "death count"</p>

        <p>If you found more info in your research, I'll trust that in this counting, but I have also seen in CDC info that Doctors can (&amp; do) just 'presume' that a person has Covid if the Doctor thinks they do &amp; doesn't test. To conserve tests, ya see... Don't want to waste a test on a sick person that can be 'presumed' when they could be used for a false positive on a healthy person! </p>
<p>Of course, if US history tells us anything, it is Doctors would never, ever, lie.</p>

<p>They might still be doing what you said though, there could be a loophole to where they don't need the local test or something, I just didn't see anything like that.</p>

        <p>I just wish that when I showed this to people they would believe me, but even with proof I still get treated like a wacky conspiracy theorist. I don’t get it. Don’t you think the CDC knows how to use words?? I am sure if they meant deaths from covid then they would write that..</p>
