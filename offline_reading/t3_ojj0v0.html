    <strong>I hadn't known a thing about Anti-Vaxxers until around 2014</strong>
    <p><p>Then they were being talked about everywhere. I mean, who would be stupid enough to deny their child the fucking polio vaccine? Six years of the most insane people letting their children die of whooping cough and trying to treat it with essential oils.</p>
<p>And after years of having them be the laughing stock of even moderately intelligent people, suddenly this vaccine comes out, and now anyone who shows any hesitancy can be easily lumped in with a group that had been primed as idiots for the past 6 years.</p>
<p>Makes you think.</p></p>

        <p>Good, I was hoping someone would mention this. Spend some time looking at the research by virologists and microbiologists like Stefan Lanka, Kerry Mullis, and others and you will begin to question everything. Eventually you can work back to germ theory (Pasteur) vs terrain theory (Bechamp) and get a lesson in rewritten history disguised as philanthropy.</p>

        <p>Exactly. People ignore this part of vaccines.
Whooping cough made a comeback only AFTER they started vaccinating against it. And they blamed those without the vaccines because they got sick from those with the vaccine... it is pure insanity. They are literally spreading the disease with the vaccine and nobody gives a shit because to question big pharma is to commit social suicide.</p>

        <p>I really like this article talking about how we’ve been duped by vaccine makers for decades.</p>
<p>https://www.lewrockwell.com/2015/04/bretigne-shaffer/first-they-came-for-the-anti-vaxxers/</p>
<p>I find it so weird that people dislike being called anti-vax as if the other vaccines aren’t also an unnecessary cash grab. 
Polio and small pox did a number on humans but the vaccine is NOT the reason it subsided. It subsided because humans developed an immune response. Only AFTER mortality fell dramatically were vaccines introduced. Then they claimed credit for stopping polio and small pox but it’s all a smoke screen. Some may find this hard to believe but those who seek to make billions have no issue lying or stretching the truth. 
When your entire business model is based on pushing fear, you’re probably a useless product.</p>

        <p>I really don’t get how people can watch this covid sham going down right before their eyes, but can’t fathom that this same propaganda could’ve happened before with previous diseases/vaccines. </p>
<p>I’m willing to accept that some vaccines might benefit <em>some</em> people, but it never should’ve become a routine procedure, and certainly never mandated. The whole industry is shrouded in corrupt billionaire BS, it’s not limited to the covid vaccines.</p>

        <p>It's because people have been conditioned into believing that the government always has their best interests at heart and can do no wrong. They can't believe that government would ever be out to harm or kill them or molest their children, despite the abundant evidence of the 20th century that no government is to be trusted. In fact, they would never believe it, which is what the government has rightly gambled on. </p>

<p>Nothing screams health like a one-size-fits-all treatment! That alone should tell you the covid medical countermeasures are bullshit.</p>

        <p>Why? Have you not studied other vaccines? Do you think big pharma is noble for some vaccines but just not the COVID one?</p>

        <p>I’m all for vaccines. Just ones they do just for money. No flu shots, no covid shots. Only things that are tested and proven they work. Even the flu vaccine they’re changing every year and it isn’t even the version of the virus that’s spreading! Had covid not arrived, would anyone take a pill that wasn’t tested?</p>

        <p>Pretty sure I got whooping cough as a kid. My kids haven’t gotten it. Yeah they’re all for profit but some of them are actually useful. I’m sure they all have side effects but at least we know there are for those ones</p>

        <p>Well, good proles/Outer Party members weren't supposed to know a thing about Eurasians/Eastasians either.</p>
<p>Just that their some faceless, nameless, less-than-human boogeyman to be feared and despised rather than understood as human beings created in God's image with their own concerns and experiences.</p>
