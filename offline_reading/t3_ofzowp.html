    <strong>My friend's vaccine loving parents got problems and I need advice</strong>
    <p><p>So funny banner aside. I need to rant for a sec. A good friend of mine (let's call him R) who is a 20 year old patriot trying to get a job and a car and move out while go to community College.</p>
<p>R has known that the vaccine and pandemic is fishy from the beginning and never trusted either, but his 3 siblings and 2 parents trust it unconditionally. Total mask cucks even when he wasn't. Once the vaccine started becoming more available R's parents started to heavily pressure him into getting the vax and R repeatedly refused. Then 2 days ago his parents really pushed him and his dad straight up said either get dose 1 or go to a homeless shelter so he finally unwillingly budged on 1 shot very much with anger and with fake consent. He was made to take it unwillingly and now they want R to get shot #2 at a later date. </p>
<p>He unfortunately lives at home with no job nor car even though he's trying to change that. What can he realistically do to get out of it? He does not want it whatsoever and he only begrudgingly got shot #1 under threat of eviction. And yes his parents would totally kick him out within the second he refused. Is he screwed to where he really doesn't have a choice or does he have some means to resist? I know if you are an adult in your parents house they can pretty much make you do anything with threat of eviction, but isn't something like a forced medical decision too far? Does he have any legal means to resist without having to move out? Maybe force them to sign a liability waiver, or some legal loophole to escape it? Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>Not trying to make excuses or anything, but none of his friends in his immediate circle would help him, he doesn't have a car, and he's kinda mentally slow (98% certain he has autism) and no job he's interviewed and applied for even called him back. My other fear is that shelters will or already do require vaccinations too. Any other thoughts?</p>

        <p>Can you help him? </p>
<p>My favorite bagger at the local grocery store has down syndrome. A guy who is legally blind folds boxes at a papa John's full time. There are jobs out there, especially in this climate where people don't want to work.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be harsh, but either your buddy needs to dig down deep, stop being a victim and find his own way or he relies on the rules of those he depends on. It's truly that simple. </p>
<p>I wish you both the best of luck.</p>

        <p>There are currently &rt;9.2M job openings in the US that can't be filled because .gov is giving people free money to stay at home.</p>
<p>I would've left for the shelter without batting an eyelid. It's terrible that the totalitarian parents forced him to be jabbed, but he ultimately allowed himself to be coerced. </p>
<p>Jab #2 isn't an option: he should move out and find a job without being picky. He can go to a shelter until he finds a job and can co-rent with another person.</p>

        <p>He is an adult and had to put his signature on the wavier to get the vaccine. In the end, he made the decision to get it, not them. </p>
<p>Honestly, he would have been better off getting kicked out if he wanted to do some type of legal route.  There’s probably some eviction code that could have been referenced. </p>
<p>Keep in mind though, lawyers need payment to do stuff, so that doesn’t sound like a realistic way to go.</p>

        <p>If he is in the US, most states have an eviction process that needs to be followed.  That will buy him at least 30 days, more if they mess up any of the paperwork. It doesn’t matter if he was not paying.  He should contact a local tenant’s rights organization for help with the paperwork.  There are a lot of jobs available right now, why is he having trouble finding one?</p>
