<title>The Rock says he tested positive and it was tougher than anything he ever dealt with in his life. On August 24 he posted a picture of tequila and multiple workout clips in the last couple of weeks. Are celebrities getting paid?</title>

        <p>Yup exactly. The Rock was literally talking about it as if its a death sentence and how it was so difficult to endure. I seriously don't get how anyone can fall for that BS, and this is even more proof that celebrity "influencers" are being paid to spread this propaganda.</p>

        <p>20 years ago, I got the flu. And I still remember it very clearly because I felt like I was going to die. It hurt to blink. Getting really sick is very unpleasant (if he really was). Then, if you're in 99.6+ % of the population, you get better and drink tequila or whatever. These people are nuts acting like being sick is some kind of once in a lifetime trial to barely survive.</p>

        <p>I never thought that I would say this because Dwayne seem(ed) like the one of the few genuine celebrities out there, but FUCK THE ROCK. This is the biggest crock of shit I have ever heard.</p>
<p>The hardest thing he ever went through? Yet he says absolutely NOTHING about his symptoms and what he supposedly went through medically. I love how he especially makes sure to tell us that his two young daughters got it, in case we think children can't get it either (let's keep kids out of school forever). And how did he get it? From not social distancing ENOUGH apparently.</p>
<p>His fake speech ticks all the boxes e.g. anyone can get it, even big strong guys like him, he caught it from not social distancing, everyone should wear a mask, blah blah blah.</p>
<p>He talks about boosting your immune system while every other post on his IG feed is him peddling his new Tequila brand (he is even wearing the brand hoodie in the video). Are you fucking kidding me?! Yeah, alcohol will DEFINITELY help boost your immune system.</p>
<p>He is a complete money whore. Go look at his feed. He's got a new sneaker line in the works too because I guess you can never be too rich. JFC.</p>
<p>YES, he is a paid shill for the WHO. Ditto Tom Hanks, Idris Elba and every other celebrity they are paying off to tell these LIES.  The whole fucking thing is so clearly orchestrated I don't know how people can keep buying it.</p>

        <p>Idk...I’m not a conspiracy theorist ever, but I’m starting to think something like this IS happening.  Look at Chris Cuomo. I’m almost positive he never had it-whether he decided to lie or got pushed by CNN to do it. Between the walk with his family while he has it, the hallucinations he talked about, the fact he says he still suffers from side effects but posts intense workouts online (similar to the rock)... it doesn’t add up.</p>

        <p>Roid Rage Cuomo was absolutely either fabricating or exaggerating symptoms (assuming he even had the virus in the first place)</p>
<p>Supposedly having fever tremors so violent that he chipped a tooth, yet he was completely composed and capable of sitting still in front of the camera for an hour every night?</p>
<p>Supposedly had a persistent cough yet he never once coughed on his show?</p>
<p>Think of before we were all forced to live in hermetically sealed sterile bubbles and a coworker would come to work with a cold or a flu.  You could always tell when they were under the weather, yes?  The only tangible differences on Cuomo's show while he was "sick" and "quarantining" were location and outfit.  I don't buy it for a second.</p>

        <p>Actually, it did. Not in the sense of celebrities going on TV to talk about their struggles with Ebola, but to inform people about how it spreads and how to mitigate the risks of transmission. In the West African epidemic, the WHO set up teams to go into cities and rural areas to highlight the need for basic sanitation (hand washing was at times a hard sell in places where people didn't have enough water to drink, let alone wash their hands with multiple times a day) and alteration of burial practices (washing the body of the deceased shortly after death is a common practice after death in some areas of Africa; it's also one of the best ways to spread Ebola). They had to get key religious leaders on board to pass the message that there were safer burial methods that needed to be implemented.</p>
<p>And there were a number of stories about Ebola hospitals being attacked and aid workers killed when mobs came in claiming Ebola didn't exist or was a fabrication of Western elites in order to depopulate Africa (sound familiar?)</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'd guess so. This virus isn't serious enough for people to panic, but is serious enough that we should probably do something, so everyone is trying to be manipulated to act in a certain way.</p>

        <p>Give me a break. I’ve known 3 people who had this who were not hospitalized, one was older. 2 of them would have never known if they weren’t tested. </p>
<p>Also placebo is a powerful thing. If you think you are going to feel major symptoms and have been told you are positive, you just might.</p>

        <p>[ But $1 million of that total salary consists of a "social-media fee." According to Variety, this means that Johnson is charging the film's studio, Universal Pictures, in order to promote "Red Notice" on his own social media pages, including Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter] (https://www.businessinsider.com/the-rock-gets-paid-1-million-to-post-about-his-movie-red-notice-on-social-media-2018-5?op=1)
Pretty mediocre article, iirc it costs about a mill to have the Rock tweet for promotional purposes.</p>

        <p>&rt; <strong>Are celebrities getting paid?</strong> </p>
<p>while i don't know about the specific of the rock here, in general YES!</p>
<p>i can highly suggest this great corbett report about it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/who-cares-what-celebrities-think-propagandawatch/">https://www.corbettreport.com/who-cares-what-celebrities-think-propagandawatch/</a> </p>
<p>(video watchable on many platforms, u don't have to read anything, if u don't want to. sharing this link prevents censorship and links directly to the creator and also shows the references/show notes)</p>
<p>WHO hired the same marketing company "hill and knowlton strategies" in their move to use social media influencers as their newest propaganda.</p>
<p>the "best" part of it is, that hill and knowlton strategies is the same PR firm, that was behind the fake girl testimony from "nayirah" in 19190 about the babies being thrown on the cold floor in the hospital to die. all fake, never happened, but was a great emotion hitting propaganda to justify an invasion.</p>
<p>it also shows, that all of mainstream media is pure propaganda as they were repeating this lie many many times and never ever questioned its validity, which as far as i understand would have been quite easy to  see as fake with a bit of real journalism.</p>
<p>however i am a much worse writer than corbett  and he is way more precise than me too, so just watch this excellent propaganda watch video.</p>
<p>this is also a GREAT video to share with your friends, who still believe in those influencers being important.</p>
