    <strong>Apparently, if you claim that your friend/relative died from COVID, funeral costs would be covered (BC, Canada)</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, new member here. Not sure if this is true, but this is what I heard:</p>
<p>My partner's mother's uncle recently passed away from a heart attack. But my partner's mother's family, unfortunately, could not cover the funeral and cremation costs. However, this is the kicker: the funeral home came up to them and said that if they claim that he passed from COVID, they would cover all the funeral costs. So that's what his family did. </p>
<p>If this is true, no fking wonder so many people are "dying from COVID" every day.</p>
<p>Just wanted to share.</p></p>

        <p>Yea, I heard that the funeral home will edit the death certificate and posthumously infect them with COVID so that they count toward the statistics.  I don't know if it's true, but I heard it, so it's true.  No wonder everyone's dying from COVID.</p>

        <p>I don't think what the funeral says and what the health department says have anything to do with each other. It's very difficult to get a death certificate changed. This would definitely be grounds for a doctor to lose their license if they were caught illegally changing the death certificate for a funeral.</p>

        <p>That may be possible, but then why would the funeral home want to get people to say that their friends and family died from covid? And I think they can list it as a secondary reason if death? Donâ€™t quote me on that though.</p>

        <p>The law in the UK was changed after the discovery of a serial killer GP - Harold Shipman - death certificate requirements were tightened substantially. About the time that the Kung Flu became apparent, restrictions were loosened again. Much of the evidence has now been cremated.</p>
