        <p>They will claim it was “taken out of context” or that “we must save the masks for health care professionals” but here’s the thing. </p>
<p>Health care professionals and hospitals and such are not going to Walmart and buying a pack of masks.  They get special shipments directly from the mask manufacturers or some form of healthcare supplies company. Sometimes a pallet of then and These masks are not the same as the ones sold in stores.  They are likely made differently and likely have a different quantity to them. </p>
<p>Maybe in the beginning they were needed but this whole thing died off months ago and they know it but if they don’t want to admit to it.</p>

        <p>I agree, they will always find a way to make excuses to justify the narrative.</p>
<p>I have done plenty of research on masks, from design, composition and testing requirements in conjunction with comparing the size of a vast number of particles, including virus's and COVID specifically, with the mask specifications. And believe me if you will, even the highly toted N95 would be insufficient for COVID spread prevention. As for paper and cloth masks, you might as well draw a circle around your mouth and nose and pretend your wearing one. It would have the same effectiveness.</p>
<p>Cheers Mate and have a great night!</p>

        <p>SS: Fascinating how the Icons that are orchestrating this pandemic, those same Icons who have amassed a global cult following that are willing to surrender their very lives too, can change the science at any given moment, the science these followers bow to in reverence and deem as beyond repute.</p>
<p>So whichever science suits the narrative at any given moment will be the science that we are forbidden to question and therefore all former science, even the science they openly proclaimed should be wiped from our memories and no longer spoken of.</p>

        <p>I just subscribed to his channel, seems like great video material from what I can see! Also, on a side note we should take the mask wearing debate way way back to the Spanish Flu, the fossil himself had written a paper that the deaths from the second wave were not from the virus itself, people were dying from bacterial pneumonia caused by extensive mask wearing</p>

        <p>A persona after my very own heart! lol :) I read that article too among number of others  surrounding the "mystery" and speculation of the Spanish flu. IN particular how it is theorized that the reason so few elderly died in relative comparison to the considered healthy age groups was due to a former exposure to a virus that provided them with an innate tolerance / immunity.</p>
<p>Then there are the people who try and correlate the isolation methods to the plague when the plague was transmitted by fleas living in the rat population. Human to human transmission was extremely rare and virtually non existent. People just didn't wan to see live people decomposing in front of them.</p>

        <p>This is true, but the sheep certainly need as many reminders as they can get.. This is the man who s become, next to Gates lol, World's Science advisor. I would have to think he would have had access and be privy to all the science and studies surrounding the efficacy of masks with respect to Viral contraction and transmission, and then produced this statement.. Too bad people cannot reason this.</p>
