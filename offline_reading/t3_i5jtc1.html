    <strong>Masks Don't Slow the Spread: A Case Study</strong>
    <p><p>I would like to highlight the number of COVID cases relative to the mandating of mask-wearing in the state of New Mexico. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of NM ordered masks to be worn outside around May 17th (2). Exceptions were allowed for eating and exercising. Exercise exemptions were removed in early July (5).  My cursor shows the date of the 17th relative to the included graph. </p>
<p>Now the graph clearly shows that peak cases happened AFTER the mask mandate was given. </p>
<p>What does this mean? One conclusion that can be made is that masks do not in fact slow the spread of repertory illnesses. </p>
<p>If you are still not convinced by the case-number evidence, there are plenty other sources stating the same thing. Take the New England Journal of Medicine. " We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection." (Klompas et al., paragraph 2). Or take a paper published in the CDC EID Journal, Volume 26, Number 5; published in May of 2020. " Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza." (Xiao et al., paragraph 14). </p>
<p>As many politicians say "The Science is Settled". Multiple laboratory studies over the years, and some analyses as soon as May of this year, have concluded that face masks do very little to nothing to stop the transmission and spread of repertory illnesses. </p>
<p>Why governments, despite the evidence, are ordering mandatory mask wearing is beyond me to know why. </p>
