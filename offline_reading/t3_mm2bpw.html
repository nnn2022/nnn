        <p>My job is never done. Don't worry guys, I'm taking one for the team; I read this toxic attempt of a sentence so that you don't have to!</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p>&rt;LICK MY BALLS HOE YOU A HOE MOTHAFUCKA U A HOE</p>
<p>Based on my observation so far, you are not well educated or are a high school freshman drop out. Fortunately for you, I am here to help you with your grammar issues.</p>
<p>Your sentence structure is incorrect, you started your sentence with a verb, it is probably best to start your sentence with a pronoun, noun or a preposition. You also fail to link your ideas with conjunctions, failing to use "and, although, but" and other modifiers.</p>
<p>Secondly, your use the word "hoe." A hoe is a garden tool. Are you attempting to tell us we are garden tools? Are you attempting to use the word hooker, or derogatory phrase or word to insult us? This is not clear.</p>
<p>Thirdly, you tell us to perform an action without being particular specific. For example, you asked us to "lick my balls," can you elaborate on what kind? Tennis balls? Basketballs? Baseballs? Moth balls? Are they flavored? Large balls, small balls? It is difficult gauge why you would want us to lick something we have very little knowledge about.</p>
<p>Also, I notice some severe misspellings. You wrote, "U a hoe." While this looks harmless, it is horribly wrong, you may want to write, "Your mother is a hooker." You may want to write, "I believe your mother to be a hooker." It is more descriptive, and provides more context.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>
<p>If this "person" writes like this, imagine how they speaks? This individual has never heard of grammarly!</p>
