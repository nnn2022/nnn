    <strong>Less trust in the government and people. I don't know anyone who had C-19 or died of it either.</strong>
    <p><p><strong>TL;DR: Less trust in the government and other people because of restrictions. I don't know anyone who had C-19 or has died of it.</strong></p>
<p>Before this started, I knew the government, other people and so on were flawed. I've read news, history books etc. before. But I thought most people knew better in the 2000s since some improvement had happen after WW2. More countries got democracies, a wealthier - more educated population, better medical technology, lived longer and a better living standards. Although oppression, poverty etc. still existed, many countries in the early 2000s had more freedom than in the past. Especially Western ones. In addition there were many good businesses, travelling, okayish schools and most people could walk freely around. No curfews, no closing of schools, recreational activities or shops, no travelling restrictions or fashion laws in the early 2000s pre-COVID19 time. Unless you lived in an authoritarian dictatorship, you didn't need to worry about these things before COVID19.</p>
<p>Many governments, especially in the Western world, weren't that authoritarian or controlling although they had flaws back then. Nowadays the government can decide how many people you're allowed meeting even in your home. In addition some wants vaccine passport for a rushed vaccine for a virus with over 99,9% survival chance. Over 2 million people are "COVID19 deaths" in 2020, according to WHO. We're ca. 7,8 billion people on Earth, the vast majority of deaths are 70+ and with underlying conditions. We can't lockdown schools, businesses etc., letting many people die of poverty, loneliness, depression and getting their life quality destroyed. What if equally many dies of COVID19 measures like of COVID19, like a Swedish study claims (Done by Stefan Swartling Peterson and Anna Mia Ekström using data from UN, Unicef, Unaids)? In addition overwhelmed hospitals could've been fixed if politicians prioritized healthcare more. Some had been warned for years that the population would grow and we would've more old people.</p>
<p>I don't know anyone who had COVID-19. I don't know anyone who got severely ill or died of it either. Neither does my friend, my friend's friend and friend's friend's friends. It's an invisible enemy and we need constant fearmongering from the media to remind us about it's existence to know about it and be afraid. If we didn't have the internet, we wouldn't have known about it's existence. My misanthropic traits have grown stronger and I went from a regular child free to not wanting children to grow up in this dystopian world experiencing all the security s-show. Many people nowadays are extreme transhumanists and pro-safety, thinking technology and lockdown can prevent all deaths. Living till you're old isn't good enough anymore. Now we need to lockdown to prevent all deaths, they think. It has replaced old religions.</p></p>

        <p>I had an illness similar to what they describe as covid. I was ill for a week, had residual symptoms for two weeks after that, and now it's like it never happened. Same exact experience as the last time I had the flu. Maybe even less intense. Probably due to it, ya know, <em>being the flu...</em></p>

        <p>There is one political perspective in particular driving all of this.</p>
<p>Can you guess which one?</p>
