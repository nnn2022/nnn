    <strong>Spherical virus in a vacuum</strong>
    <p><p>This whole response reminds me of a joke my college physics professor told once. </p>
<p>A farmer was having problems with his chickens. He called all the vets in the area to no avail. Finally he calls his physicist friend over who studies the problem and says "I have a solution but it will only work with spherical chickens in a vacuum."</p>
<p>Why is everyone so laser focused on the virus and nothing else?  Everything we do to fight this has wider effects. Even masks and social distance effect peoples mental health. I keep hearing people say "it's only a mask" but seeing other people smile causes chemical reactions in your brain to say nothing of the hard of hearing. I think it goes without saying that the more strict measures have much larger and measurable impacts but everyone either doesn't care, thinks it's worth it somehow or thinks that you can have massive changes to society with no ill effects. </p>
