    <strong>Doesn't the mRNA vaccine just create GMO people?</strong>
    <p><p>hear me out....actually, hear out these quotes</p>
<p>from the CDC</p>
<p>" mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine to protect against infectious diseases. To trigger an immune response, many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies. Not mRNA vaccines. <strong><em>Instead, they teach our cells how to make a protein</em></strong>—or even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies. "</p>
<p>" <strong><em>COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give instructions for our cells to make</em></strong> a harmless piece of what is called the “spike protein.” The spike protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. "</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and the definition of "genetically modified organism" GMO</p>
<p>" An organism whose genetic characteristics have been altered by the insertion of a modified gene or a gene from another organism using the techniques of genetic engineering. "</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>im no scientist but doesn't that mean that the people who took the vaccine, essentially became GMO people?</p>
<p>I mean the way I am reading this is....</p>
<p>mRNA = tells your cells what to do they didnt otherwise do naturally</p>
<p>GMO = tells your cells what to do that they didnt otherwise do naturally</p>
<p>and if that's the case then a follow up question would be....are those people now owned by the company that own the patent of the vaccine? I mean, we can patent GMO stuff, and if a person has now been classified as GMO......or would they own the parts that taught "our cells how to make a [COVID] protein"........</p></p>

        <p>Yup, it gene therapy, not a vaccine. GMO people is a good way to look at it.</p>
