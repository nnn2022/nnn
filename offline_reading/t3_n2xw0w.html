    <strong>Those who strongly support lockdowns are either unemployed already, or have not missed a paycheck this whole time.</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Edit since some people are completely missing my point...</strong></p>
<p>I'm in no way saying you can't be against lockdowns if you're unemployed. What I'm saying is that the people who are the most strongly in support of keeping people from going to work, are the ones who weren't working to begin with, or who's jobs weren't affected. </p>
<p>To put it a simplery way, <em>the ones preaching the loudest about how it's for the "greater good" are the ones who haven't had to suffer for it.</em></p>
<p>Wasn't aware that reading comprehension was at an all-time low these days.</p></p>

        <p>I lost a job of 33 years to “covid cuts” and I get low unemployment and no insurance but I have a investment account to live off of and I still don’t support masks or shots or lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I think they meant people who were unemployed before, as in those waste of space basement dweller man children who have never worked full time in their lives, and probably teenagers and some college kids. People who ended up unemployed because of this know it's bullshit</p>

        <p>Partly disagree, I find it’s mostly people with cushy work-from-home jobs and dependents who are both totally detached from the fact that people need more than a stimulus check once every 3 months to feed themselves and their families.</p>

        <p>I've been forced to work from home "because of COVID" and am staunchly against lockdowns, jabs, etc. But WFH is also standard in my industry (IT) and has been an option for decades. To me it seems like it's mostly WFH teachers and similar who are pushing for lockdowns, so they can continue working from home even though they aren't being effective. They essentially want to continue their paid holiday.</p>

        <p>My mistake, you’re right in pointing out how it’s those where working from home is novel and they get to enjoy their vacation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they smugly would say “if only you (while I was a barista) could work from home too”.  First, the audacity.  Second, I prefer working here and I’ll even do it with my mask off.</p>

        <p>I was working 20 hours a week until I broke my wrist. I actually got some “COVID bonuses” which was a lot of money after every quarter, so that was great. Worked at food Lion. Most of my managers were chill about the masks and stuff and if they ever said I had to put one on it was because they were worried that corporate would show up randomly and get pissed off. (Head of corporate is a complete Karen). Didn’t even have to wear one in the back room, was nice.</p>
<p>I don’t want to work again until after college but I probably have to find a job somewhere.</p>

        <p>100% agree both with and without the edit but I seriously knew exactly what you meant when I read the title. I'm one of those people who lost my job which I actually loved and have been depressed on the brink of suicide but I have a family that needs me with another on the way in 2 months. Don't know what the fuck we're going to do, lol. Good post OP.</p>
