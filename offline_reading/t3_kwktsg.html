    <strong>Just great...</strong>
    <p><p>So my school has been virtual since the end of December and now we are staying virtual until February 2nd. I don’t know why the hell they keep extending it, but I'm fed up. I've been trying my best to follow the rules so I don't get kicked out, but my patience is thinning. I've given up so much already, and it's all been for nothing. I am learning absolutely nothing all day, and it feels like perpetual homework. I'm so outraged right now, because I should be at school with my friends and actually DOING stuff, not sitting in front of my computer all day like a basement dwelling loser. I just want a normal junior year, but it looks like for now I'm stuck at home in front of my computer all day, learning nothing. I need the school to be open like normal for the sake of my mental health. As an autistic person, changes to my routine are detrimental to me, and having to wear a mask all day causes me sensory overload, which is debilitating to deal with. I'm also concerned about the special needs kids that cannot learn virtually, they need to be at school in order to receive the services they need. We are harming everyone here, and for no good reason either.</p>
<p>Our theatre and dance programs have been trying to film our production of The Nutcracker, but us going virtual completely ruined all that. We never got to finish filming it, and now we're super behind on it. On top of that, none of us know when the hell we can rehearse for our spring production because the liberal idiots on the board might keep us home. Theater is more than just an extracurricular activity to me. It's one of my passions, and it brings me so much joy. All of that is being taken away from me now. All my classmates seem miserable and depressed, and I don’t blame them. This is a crime what these government clowns are doing to us in the name of "sAfEtY." </p>
<p>I'm tired of sitting here and watching as my life is being taken away. I'm so close to staging a protest, but I don’t know if people will join me. Also, I don't want people to label me as a terrorist or something like that. I'm just so tired of having to sacrifice my livelihood just because someone else is scared of getting sick.</p></p>
