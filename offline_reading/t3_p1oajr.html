    <strong>Spike Shedding</strong>
    <p><p>Hey normal thinking Folks, </p>
<p>I am unvaccinated. I plan to stay unvaccinated, No Matter If I lose my Job or they restrict my activities like Gym, traveling etc. They cant scare me, the more they push for thr vaccine and pressure the population, the less i am willed to Take it</p>
<p>All my Friends and most of the Girls I meet are vaccinated, the Most people in my age are nowadays</p>
<p>Do you have trustful sources that their vaccinations can harm me? </p>
<p>Stay strong, stand up and continue using your Common Sense. Don't Fall for Propaganda. We are in this together</p></p>

        <p>As far as I know, these ARNm (Pfizer, Moderna) and Vector (Astra-Zeneca, Janssen) based injections can't "harm" the non-vaccinated, as they don't use a replicating virus in the process. The ARNm/adenovirus orders your cells to produce some proteins of the virus, which don't have any replication properties (they're just proteins), and they cannot infect or be transferred to other bodies.</p>
<p>In regular vaccines (that use a replicating virus) other individuals can be inmunized from contact with vaccinated persons, which it's very helpful for erradicating the disease, but that's not the case with the Covid injections. </p>
<p>That being said, there might be some (not very likely at the moment) ways that these covid injections can harm the non-vaccinated:</p>
<p>- The vaccination campaign causes the virus to mutate to a deadlier (worst-than-initial) virus that the non-vaccinated persons won't be able to withstand.</p>
<p>- The spike proteins turn somehow into prions (very unlikely but if that happens everyone will be f*cked).</p>
<p><em>---That's my opinion on the subject, at least.---</em></p>

        <p>Viral shedding is a thing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_shedding</p>
<p>The jab does not prevent those jabbed from getting infected.  Thus, jabbed people are capable of shedding due to their viral load.</p>
<p>There is also evidence that the spike protein induced into production by the jab can be shed, and that that spike protein can be harmful.</p>

        <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_shedding">Viral shedding</a></strong> </p>
<p>&rt;Viral shedding refers to the expulsion and release of virus progeny following successful reproduction during a host-cell infection. Once replication has been completed and the host cell is exhausted of all resources in making viral progeny, the viruses may begin to leave the cell by several methods. The term is used to refer to shedding from a single cell, shedding from one part of the body into another part of the body, and shedding from bodies into the environment where the viruses may infect other bodies. Vaccine shedding refers to rare instances where potentially infective virions have been shed post vaccination.</p>
