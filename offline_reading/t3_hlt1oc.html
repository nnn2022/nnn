    <strong>Is your health really my responsibility?</strong>
    <p><p>We live in a society that believes that you should not trample on the rights of others. The last few months have introduced new ideas on what the rights of others entail. We were supposed to stay inside to prevent spread of disease. We had to shut down our businesses. We had to shut down our schools. We had to let loved ones die alone and without funerals. All in the name of safety and the rights of others. By going out we were endangering the health of others, and thus their right to live.</p>
<p>Now, it's masks. Not wearing a mask means we are being disrespectful of other people's right to live a healthy life.  We are allowing the disease to spread anytime we go outside without one. The most respectful of people wear them while they're on a jog or when they're driving by themselves - you never know when you could spread disease. Some schools are requiring that students wear masks, because nobody wants the children to die.</p>
<p>I really don't get it. How far are we going to go with this? Covid-19 isn't even that deadly . It's comparable to other things that kill us - like the flu. The idea that my germs could cause somebody else to get sick and die and that I must go out of my way to prevent that, is absurd. Humans carry lots of germs. It's part of being alive.</p>
<p>If I get a cold sore, will I be required to wear a mask? What about the flu every year? Are we going to require masks? Not very many people are wearing gloves. What if somebody didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom? Should we start monitoring sink usage after using the toilet? What if somebody hasn't showered in a week? I bet they are more likely to have germs. We should start requiring daily showers. What about somebody who hasn't been vaccinated for covid-19 if a vaccine ever arises? Are we going to ostracize them from society? Banish them to the wilderness?</p>
<p>These new health mandates actually seem to be trampling on my rights. This is a normal virus - it's not  something to be hysterical about. Yet, we completely shut down society to try to protect the health of others. Now, we are requiring masks in the name of safety. For the safety of others, I must wear a mask at all times. More and more states and cities are beginning to require masks in all indoor/public settings, with no known end date. It is beyond ridiculous.</p>
<p>How far, and for how long, are we going to go with this?</p></p>

        <p>No one gave a shit about grandmas until mid March. The fact that we have so many nursing homes proves that.  This has nothing to do with showing how much you care. It’s about it showing people how much better you are than others. If you want to feel superior just buy a Chanel bag and stop telling me what to do.</p>

        <p>It's literally a recipe for bad health. At first I was eating healthier, going for walks, yoga, sleeping early but I fell off. I just started getting really angry about the whole situation and fed up of being so constrained. </p>
<p>The last time I went for a walk a local busybody told me I couldn't walk somewhere (it's become a one way system apparently) and then tried to give me directions. I stopped her and said 'I've lived in this village my whole life, I know how to get home thanks'. I still can't decide if I was being rude or if she shouldn't police others</p>

        <p>Vitamin D is a big one. And an elephant in the room is being ignored: in countries located at a fairly northern latitude -- or in places with a lack of UV rays and/or short daylight hours in the winter months -- it is imperative that everyone take vitamin D supplements, <em>but especially</em> people with more melanin in their skin. And yet there has never been adequate messaging around this from a public-health perspective.</p>
<p>I live in the UK where, for a variety of reasons, certain ethnic-minority populations have been disproportionately affected. But the government is afraid to even release sections of a report which was commissioned to look into contributing factors. This information and better awareness around it could literally save lives, so wtf.</p>
<p>We need to really talk about health &amp; wellbeing from a holistic perspective and emphasise preventative measures. People don't understand how to maximise their immune system responses and the government is ignoring this side of it.</p>

        <p>Many residents were confined to their rooms, not allowed to socialize with other residents, no visitors.  Massive disruptions in routine.  Social isolation is well documented to cause poorer health outcomes.  I have heard many stories about nursing home residents that just stopped eating, probably due to this.</p>

        <p>Yup it’s still like this. I work LTC and the patients haven’t seen their families in months. And they are still required to stay in their rooms all day. No socializing, no dinners in the dining hall, no visitors. A lot of them are not doing well obviously. It’s inhuman and there’s no end in sight.

        <p>A friend of mine went off on some rant I could not believe I was seeing. </p>
<p>She explained about 20 years ago she got turbculosis from a cab driver in Korea who did not wear a mask, (so she said) her health is ruined for the rest of her life because of that guy.  I've known her for over a decade, I had no idea she had this health issue, she never mentioned it before. </p>
<p>She then got pissed off at me because I've gone to work sick, saying its because of shitty people like me being selfish, that is ruining other peoples lives by not having a job that gives me enough PTO to take off work when I am sick.</p>
<p>And then ordered that I go ought to go out and get a pathogen test...?  </p>

        <p>A big part of it is virtue signalling, but the people doing the virtue signalling lack self-awareness, these people also fall for the every-day hysteria of the MSM.</p>
<p>One person I know tells me that wearing masks saves lives lives, its to protect the health of others, yet he has no problem lighting up a cigarette in public spaces, around other people, and ive never once seen him ask someone if they mind being around the 2nd hand smoke.</p>
<p>Another person I know told me how the lockdown protesters in Michigan were putting peoples lives at risk. Yet hasnt said one bad things about the tens of thousands, or more, BLM protesters. This person also took the very first opportunity to leave once she was granted permission, even though she lives in an apartment building with numerous elderly people.</p>
<p>And then there's the just plain ludicrousness of going to the dentist, honestly its laughable. My dentist called me to reschedule a previous appointment. They told me I will need to wait in my car until someone comes to let me in; then, I will need to wear a mask when I enter the building; and then of course the only way they can clean my teeth is by me breathing in my dentist's face for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>There's also the resteraunts and bars. A staff of 10 - 15 people are required to wear masks, yet its ok for 50 customers to not wear masks?</p>
<p>Its very simple. You accept the inherent risk of leaving your house....or you dont and you stay home.</p>
<p>If the roads are icy, you make a judgement call on whether to drive.</p>
<p>If its nightime, you make a judgement call on whether its safe to go for a walk.</p>
<p>If you eat at a restaraunt you accept the risk that you may get food poisoning.</p>
<p>If you go for a walk in the woods you accept the risk that a wild animal may attack you.</p>
<p>If you ride an airplane, you accept the risk that it may crash.</p>
<p>If you want to stay home and avoid the risk that is life itself, then go ahead, but dont think that gives you the right to dictate other people's lives.</p>

        <p>I agree with pretty much everything you said. There also seems to be an obsession with ppl calling others selfish who don’t wear a mask outside of their homes. What if they are very diligent with their hygiene, not touching their nose or mouths and covering their nose when sneezing or covering their mouth when coughing and what if they are not even sick at all?</p>

        <p>My guess is yes, to some extent. There will be people/states/governors/Karens who will push for masks permanently or at least during flu season, or on public transit, or whatever else they can dream up.</p>

        <p>To me, the logical extension of that attitude (the right not not ever be exposed to a virus in public) is that nobody should be out in public again ever, even with masks. It sounds absurd, but I can't make sense of that statement any other way. Masks aren't perfect, viruses will still spread (even if the spread <em>is</em> reduced due to masks), so anytime you go into public for anything not totally essential you're putting others at risk.</p>

        <p>That right there is the biggest evidence that this was about something else than a public health emergency. A straight up transfer of wealth from the government into private and off shore accounts.

        <p>Thank you. This has been bugging me too. Why do I have to adjust my behavior because of super paranoid stress cases and their unwarranted anxiety? All the rhetoric about my being a murderer because I don't want to walk around outside in midsummer heat with a filthy piece of cloth around my face. If you think being near me is putting you in danger, fine. Then stay clear of me (at least 6 feet I suppose since there is apparently something magical about 6 ft). Better yet, if you're so concerned go home, shut the door, douse yourself in sanitizer and stay put. Others irrational fears should not be my problem.</p>

        <p>I’m really interested in this too. It almost seems like a completely new way of thinking.</p>
<p>In some ways other people’s health has been a collective responsibility. An easy example in my country anyway is paying taxes to fund the public health system. Which most are happy to do because they also might need it. Or getting vaccinated against various illnesses and diseases which is both for yourself and others. </p>
<p>But this new hysteria over health of every individual being the responsibility of all is insane. And it just relates to covid. What other illness is treated this way?
Flu vaccines are not mandated for most people. </p>
<p>Why do we all foot the blame for every covid death?  This is literally the rhetoric where I am. 
‘If you don’t do the right thing someone could die’. 
So? 
Why not obesity, cancer, mental health?  People die of that too. </p>
<p>The government could put every single medication known to man on the public system. That would save lives, but we don’t do it. Why is this different??</p>

        <p>The idea is bothering me too, especially with those “It’s not all about you” memes that go around that make us seem responsible for multiple infections.</p>
<p>I agree we owe each other basic courtesy. I sanitize my hands before entering a store. I thank the cashiers for bagging my groceries and loading them into my cart. I wear a mask and don’t cause a scene in stores even though I strongly disagree with governor-issued mandates. </p>
<p>But I do not owe anyone, even the immunocompromised and overly terrified, the idea that I have to uproot my entire life, be forced out of a job, and plunged into isolation and the harm to my mental health, just so they can say they’re “safe.” Some immunocompromised people feel entitled to have everyone change their lives for them, even those who will never meet them. I don’t think it’s fair that I need to be responsible for the grocery cashier who may live with a parent who won’t quit smoking, or whatever hypothetical is in those memes. Do what you need to do to protect your family and yourself. But expecting the entire world to bend to you and stay home for you is selfish.</p>

        <p>i've found it quite interesting that there's no balance in media or government messages on health.</p>
<p>they keep saying how at risk everyone is, when the only people actually at risk are those who are in bad health already. and thus should be being very careful about their exposure already. i.e. cancer, heart conditions, diabetes, etc.</p>
<p>there's no mention that there's nothing to worry about if you're fit and healthy. or even any advise on how to improve your health -  improving your diet, taking vitamins C &amp; D, stopping smoking, etc. these things all combined are the best thing you could do to help yourself in this situation. the message instead is to be scared and treat everyone as an infection vector.</p>
<p>i've got friends who are scared of the virus even though they're in their early 30s. they won't consider stopping smoking though. or improving their diet. they say that's the only thing helping them through thee stress of it all.</p>
<p>the world is truly backwards</p>

        <p>I totally agree. We need to find a balance between reasonable concern for our community and individual responsibility. Our current Covid strategy ain’t it.</p>

        <p>Ive said this before but there have always been people with immunodeficiencies that have conditions which even the flu could kill them. Yet we didn’t try to tell people to stay home because hypothetically they could spread a virus which could get to those people and harm them. This is mass hysteria.</p>
