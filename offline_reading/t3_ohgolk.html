    <strong>Does flatearthers perceive us as we perceive the "sheeple"? For us, instead, they're the equivalent of the so called "covidiot" I suppose?</strong>
    <p><p>I was lurking out of curiosity on their subreddit, since someone put a link to that, and I begun to think about this.
I noticed that the general "vibe" and the words used were very similar to those who are generally seen here.
The sensation of being discredited, segregated, mocked and not-believed by the rest of "sheeple".
More importantly,the belief that everyone out there (we included) can't see the truth, while they claim to see it clearly and try to spread it (doesn't seem to face censorship though, maybe cause the ridiculousness created around them is enough)
Anyway I found there's this parallel with the situation in which we are in now with the "rest of the world", although the topic and the implications are very very different.</p>
<p>This said, I'm no flatearther (oh look,I found myself pushed to say this, remember something ahah),
it was just a random reasoning!</p>
<p>PS: can't imagine what should be like to be a flatearther and a Covid disbeliever, the level of ostracism should be terrific! ðŸ¤­</p>
<p>Have a nice day and stay strong!</p></p>

<p>Unfortuately, you can't make something true just because you want it to be true.</p>
