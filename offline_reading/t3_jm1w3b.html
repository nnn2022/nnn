        <p>Here's some copypasta.</p>
<p>While yes, it has killed a few people (actual numbers to be disputed), the VAST majority of these deaths are in elderly care homes. </p>
<p>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-new-data-show-canada-ranks-among-worlds-worst-for-ltc-deaths/</p>
<p>Up to 81%. This implies the virus, while it may be contagious, can only kill those with a weakened immune system, or are already close to dying anyhow. </p>
<p>Morso only 6% of cases died only from the WuFlu. The other 94% had over 2 other diseases to work together to become deadly. This only further pushes the idea that you essentially have to be at risk in order to die.</p>
