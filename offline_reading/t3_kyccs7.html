    <strong>Pretty sure I’m sick- from wearing a mask</strong>
    <p><p>So I keep my masks in my backpack because we don’t have lockers anymore (covid risk and now my back hurts all day) and my backpacks clean, I wash my masks every weekend and I’m not a gross person in general, my bag is clean blah blah blah. </p>
<p>But ever since returning to in person school, I’ve felt like shit. Not bad enough to stay home, but I had headaches after school (once from not drinking enough water, because I drink like 3 or 4bottles a day and we can’t fill up at school, they literally taped the water fountains shut) that I soon realized they were also from the mask. My face is also breaking out from the mask, and I just generally feel BAD after wearing it. </p>
<p>I started to wear a more breathable type (super loose fit)  but we didn’t have many and I only wash them on the weekends so I had just two of them to wear. I wore one for three days in a row and now I feel sick. Not covid (had it before) but I’m pretty sure I got sick from wearing that dirty ass mask. I wouldn’t be surprised. Masks aren’t that clean and I wish people would stop pretending they’re so good for your health.</p></p>

        <p>The thing is we only have two 3 hour periods in a day, so they assume it’s not that bad bc you’re just carrying materials for 2 classes. Except that shit is still heavy but it’s not like teachers have to carry anything so they don’t really care. Unless it’s covid.</p>

        <p>Same here. In my country we have to wear them outside as well. So basically unless I'm in my own home I have to wear a mask. I work part-time in an office and I wear the mask ~6 hours per day. I have daily headaches and sleepiness, nasal congestion and just feel my whole respiratory system really dirty and disgusting from breathing in my exhaled breath all day.</p>

        <p>I replace my mandated work mask twice a day, and if I touch it at all on the inside part. I wear the useless blue fabric mask that get mass produced in some godforsaken shop in Asia because I'm sure the conditions there are clean. We order 50 in a box packages at work and I just take a box to my desk. I tried the cloth mask for a day and felt sick.</p>
<p>I'd suggest buying a box of cheap fabric masks you can throw out easily. Do not wear the same mask more than one day.  It's like wearing the same pair of underwear for 3 days.</p>

        <p>wash your mask every day. People are getting staph infections and bacterial sinus infections and of course then getting tested for covid. Masks arent the ultimate answer.</p>

        <p>They removed your lockers, forcing you to carry all of your books and supplies needed at once for the entire day instead of just what you need. Backpacks were already known to cause lots of back problems for students. This will make that much worse.</p>
<p>They taped over drinking fountains, preventing you from getting a drink of water unless you were prepared enough to, again, plan for the entire day and carry the entire supply at once on your back like a pack mule. Dehydration can cause a lot of health issues, and can seriously hurt people.</p>
<p>This is on top of making you wear masks, which studies have shown actually increase your risk of getting sick from things like bacterial pneumonia, and also bacterial and fungal infections of the face, both of which sounds like things you may have experienced.</p>
<p>This is absolutely cruel what they are doing to you. To all of mankind. Fucking crimes against humanity.</p>

        <p>We do get lockers (my back would be broken otherwise) but the taping off water fountains is the worst! I substituted my mask with a thin scarf that I could layer as I pleased and pull up and down easily, as well as not being so cold in this weather. I've always worn scarves in class during winter months. Gradually, I realised that most people aren't fussed about the mandate and stopped wearing it, but I noticed when I was wearing it I was struggling to focus, getting quite dizzy and sometimes even feeling sick in my stomach.</p>

        <p>I have had headaches constantly since masks were mandated in all places here.  I only wear them in the grocery store but that is enough.  I almost fainted/fell down at the till last time.   Some people do not react well to it.  I also wonder if there is lead in the wires across the nose.</p>
