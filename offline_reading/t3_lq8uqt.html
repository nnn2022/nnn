    <strong>What I’ve learned in the past year.</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>
<p>Civil liberties are a fart in the wind. The “Western democracies” aren’t worthy of the name, and don’t get me started on America having the nerve to call itself the land of the free and the home of the brave. Instead, our governments looked to, of all places, China for guidance. What does a country with a 6000-year history of evil leadership do to fight a pandemic? It locks people down. Sick, healthy, doesn’t matter. You’re all potential carriers, so you’ll all pay. Hey, let’s adopt that in the rest of the world! Every quarantine in human history before this one segregated the sick people. This one segregated the healthy: the 99% of the population who could have lived life as normal, with no issues. But our elected officials knew, and know, better. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the U.S., like it or not, the most important person in your life is your governor. If you’re lucky enough for it to be Kristi Noem, you’re fine. If it’s… well, they’re too numerous to mention – you are completely at their whim. Your business opens when they say it opens. You meet with friends when they deign to let you. Same for your kids getting educated, or you having the right to walk around barefaced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holy fuck are we a species of pussies. I haven’t worn a mask once, I live in an area where enforcement is extremely loose, and still the patrons in the supermarkets and restaurants are around 96% masked up. I hoped that I could set an example. Maybe people would see me and remove their masks. Instead I’m just a lone voice. But beyond that: I don’t have kids, but if I lived in an area where my kids were forced to stay home from school for a year, for no earthly reason other than we have to keep the teachers’ unions happy, I’d be homicidal. I’m borderline homicidal anyway. Governor after governor have sabotaged their own economies to the point where it’ll take years to recover. Has ONE of them said “Look, I know this sucks and I’m effectively throwing people out of work, so it’s only fair that I don’t draw a paycheck either until this is over”? No. Not a goddamned one of them. A few well-placed bullets would be a huge net benefit to society, if it meant the lockdowns ending, schools opening, businesses opening, masks being removed, and kids and other depressed people no longer committing suicide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As usual, the “uneducated” people outside of the major metropolitan areas have more common sense in one fingernail than the intelligentsia have in their entire useless bodies. Outside my town, no one wears a mask. The rural cops don’t bother enforcing the state mask mandate, the employees sometimes stand 5 feet 11 inches away from the customers, and what do you know, the hospitals aren’t at capacity nor anywhere close. Meanwhile mask usage in New York, Washington, Los Angeles is at close to 100%, even outside, and from what I understand the shaming is fast and furious. And their case numbers are higher. Far higher. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media aren’t merely stupid. They are absolutely the enemy of the people. None of these restrictions would have happened if journalists hadn’t scared the aforementioned species of pussies into never leaving their houses. The media rang the alarm bells this whole time and haven't stopped, no matter how big the mountain of evidence in their way. “In 2 weeks, experts say cases will skyrocket.” Nothing happens. Doesn’t matter. “In another 2 weeks…” “Second wave…” “Possible superspreader event…” “UK strain…” “Third wave…” “In 2 more weeks…” “Fourth wave…” Every word of it was a lie. And not a lie based on ignorance, but a lie with a purpose. Predicated on getting the idiot masses so terrified that they’ll welcome lockdowns and beg for more. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank God almost all my entire family realizes the absurdity of this. But I’ve lost a sister and some friends over my “selfishness” and “science denial.” The sister lives in Florida and should be grateful she’s not locked down in a police state. But no, DeSantis wants to kill her and my brother-in-law. Fucking idiots.</p></p>

        <p>This is nothing more than a way to destroy the middle class. This “pandemic” has created the largest wealth gap in history. Less than 1% now have far more than everyone else combined. They have the freedom to do as they please with no consequences. They want to ensure everyone else is an obedient little peasant. And the really messed up thing is how insanely ignorant and blind the vast majority of the population is to all of this. It’s all happening right before their eyes but they still think the elites are doing this for their own good.</p>

        <p>You are not alone. I wish this was really just about the stupid virus. This is so much bigger than that, the virus has been co-opted and used for a myriad of other things and agendas. People are so stupid it's unbelievable. Especially at this point, it's been a year of this nonsense, and no one is connecting the dots? No one thinks all of the events that have happened over the last year, the riots, the Looting, the election, the virus Etc... No one really sees that all of these events are connected in some way? This whole thing is making me feel like some sort of super genius with Clairvoyant powers or something just because I have the ability to think critically which apparently no one has these days. Everyday I think about moving up into the mountains and disconnecting from all of this stuff.</p>

        <p>It's ain't just the governors. I don't think the Missouri governor is mandating masks, but our county &amp; the Kansas City mayor are enforcing it with an iron fist, pushing the expiration further down the calendar. I have to put mine over my mouth just so a Karen won't try to get me fired at Little Caesars.</p>
<p>What's strange is that random restaurants are the strictest with masks, but my local Walgreens <strong>where sick people go</strong> doesn't say a word about it when I walk in breathing free.</p>

        <p>Hey friend, just want to let you know you arent alone. To varying degrees, everyone knows this whole thing is a sham. Things seem pretty insane right now but do know that liberty will win in the end. This collective authoritarian mentality wont last, it never does. It always happens in a cycle of a century or so. Gov goes crazy and the people say no.</p>

        <p>The third point is the truest for me. I’m in my 30s and know so many people my age still cowering at home and refusing to come out more until there’s more access to a vaccine. Mind you these people are not immune compromised. Just whiny bitches who still don’t want to go into a grocery store but want everyone else to serve them by bringing them endless Amazon packages. What if your Instacart drivers or the Amazon delivery person decided they were too scared to work and wait on you and just quit en masse one day? </p>
<p>I was looking forward to going to a restaurant tonight for a meeting for an organization I’m in. No one else wanted to go, so my friend who’s the president catered to them and said their feelings are understandable. Now she’s doing a virtual meeting with a presentation. Why should I go to your stupid virtual meeting and presentation when I do that at work on any given day? (I still have to work from home with no return date to the office in sight.) A restaurant on a Tuesday night really isn’t that dangerous. It’s not like the meeting was scheduled for Saturday night at a bar. And why are you in a community service organization if you never really want to leave your house? You can’t serve the community on Zoom.</p>
<p>My mom is almost 60 and people are shocked that she goes out to eat indoors. Why shouldn’t she? She has no health problems. She had both doses of her vaccine. Like leave us alone and let us eat out if we want to.</p>

        <p>Over a Zoom gathering a couple weeks back, I said I had limited time because the wife and I were going out for Valentine's Day. </p>
<p>One guy tried preaching doom and gloom. I told him, dude, we've been indoor dining at least twice a week basically since early <em>November</em>. Hell, I even go to an office once or twice a week, with other people there! Not too many (though more than a few months back), but still, I trust the stuffy office air and low ceilings far less than well-ventilated restaurant air and high ceilings. </p>
<p>Not a whiff of COVID or even so much as a sniffle for either of us in those 4 months. Either we already had it without knowing it, are immune, and/or the notion of spread in public spaces is <em>vastly</em> overblown.</p>

<p>That guy most likely is jelous that you have prospects and some sort of purpose other than his purpose given through fear, god this 'pandemic' did expose how many wastes of space exist with 0 purpose and ambition, I guess things have been like this throughout history in certain periods but never to this extent.</p>

        <p>Because you mentioned the importance of governors -- in California we are getting very close to having enough signatures (including a margin to cover the large percentage that will inevitably be disqualified) to TRIGGER A VOTE TO RECALL GAVIN NEWSOM.    A major driver is people being pissed at the infinite, indefinite dictatorial powers he's given himself using the pandemic as an excuse.</p>
<p>If you are a registered voter in California, please download, sign, and mail back in the official recall petition at https://recallgavin2020.com .   The deadline is in March 2021, which is very soon!!</p>

        <p>My suspicions of the medical industry began, before the virus, when I researched Type 2 diabetes and ended up going keto to reverse it. There is a whole industry of manipulators, and their sheep followers, that are intent on keeping us sick. These "heroes" are torturing us. Curing us or killing us would end the cash flow. </p>
<p>"Scientific" studies are inaccurately conducted, their conclusions falsified and negative results withheld. These self-proclaimed heroes are nothing of the sort.</p>
