        <p>Too many pussies. Not enough willing to give all. It will literally be the end of any sort of freedom soon. You want to buy cupcakes? Get on the scale and let us get your BMI first...want plastic straws? Fuck off you can't have a plastic straws! Want a sugary soda in NY?? Nope, it's fattening and you're already fat...want a AK-47 to go shoot for fun? No way that's a weapon of WAR! </p>
<p>Basically, we are fucked because everyone is going to be inconvenienced to get off their asses and take their countries back. Taxation without representation is already prevalent...it was enough for some people almost 250 years ago. It's happening again all over again...repeat of the last one. In fact, what's happening in America is comparable to what happened in Russia in the late 80s and early 90s... bankruptcy...but America is self inflicting their bankruptcy...giving away what they can to every country on earth but their own...WHY?!?! We have homeless in the streets! KIDS GOING HUNGRY! </p>
<p>Liberals are to blame...I watched a guy on TikTok..Walter Masterson...if you have TikTok go troll this guy. He makes conservative people look dumb pretending to be a conservative while interviewing them..long story short, he is wrong. But the following he upholds is strong..I remember seeing him uphold and support ballot harvesting in the Georgia Senate races but never got punished for it...</p>
<p>The system is rigged, we can't sit back much longer. We will either die on our knees as servants or die standing up against a modern tyrannical socialist party. Sometimes I think we are too late...and by die I mean not resting until we are back to the states running the fed... remember, we don't work for them...they work for us..and lately they haven't been representative of our needs or our wants.</p>

        <p>The biggest perpetrators of lockdowns, security theatre, safety culture, and woke/cancel culture are all the biggest corporations and elites who are all capitalist. They want you to blame everyone and everything except our current system.</p>

        <p>I blame everyone with a wallet that's a billionaire. The government has forgotten their role and by god it's time they remember WHO they work for. </p>
<p>Politics were never meant to be a career. Senators aren't supposed to be in there for life...contributors need squelched..I say you run for office via free methods ..no sponsors allowed. Let's kick these life time political people out! Fresh blood and fresh methods ...no more campaign contributions..run on your face and followers ...if you've done good things then Karma will reward you with praise. Seeing 590 million spent on a campaign is all I need to see to understand who the candidate is running for ..</p>
<p>Not the people ...</p>
