    <strong>Do you know someone who is Advertising, Promoting, Marketing or prescribing unapproved Medical Devices? Report them to the FDA.</strong>
    <p><p>I am noticing many sources of information commenting on "therepeutic benefits" of unapproved Medical Devices. Particularly Medical devices that are currently Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA) only- which specifically bars these actions.</p>
<p>Anyone  that promotes,  markets,  advertise or " prescribes" unapproved medical devices are potentially in Breach of Medical Device Regulations Act under FDA. Particularly if they are a Corporation,  or not licensed to practice medicine. </p>
<p>If you receive, hear or are interacting with anyone who is promoting, marketing or advertising therepeutic benefits of an unapproved medical device, you should ask the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>do you have a medical license to practice medicine in the USA ?</li>
<li>do you have FDA Emergency Use Authorization to distribute,  administer and use this unapproved product?</li>
</ul>
<p>If yes to any, you should say verify this/these licenses with the FDA and clarify if the physician or Corporation is within their rights under FDA usage of unapproved products.</p>
<p>If the answer is "no" to either questions, you have a legal obligation to report said individual or Corporation to the FDA immediately.</p>

<p>As they are in breach of  the Medical Device Regulations Act under FDA and subject to injunction, fines, or even jail time. </p>
<p>All unapproved products, promotional literature,  sales documents and communications then "must" be quarantined under FDA compliance and mitigation is imperative to reduce harm to the public.</p>
<p>I implore all of you to read the Medical Device Regulations Act and follow the Federal Laws!!!!!</p>
<p>Relevant Articles:</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice has prosecuted more than 95 corporations and individuals—including physicians—for criminal charges related to selling or receiving and administering unapproved drug products to patients.11 These criminal convictions have resulted in incarceration, millions of dollars of fines, and debarment, which would preclude the debarred party from providing services in any capacity to a person with an approved or pending drug product application with the FDA.12 Physicians who import an unapproved product and use the product in the treatment of federal health care beneficiaries also may be alleged to have violated the federal False Claims Act.14</p>
