    <strong>Can you just not die? Please?</strong>
    <p><p>So now that we count deaths of all reasons towards Covid deaths statistics.</p>
<p>Can you all selfish, stupid, no mask dumbfucks, idiots, cunts, morons, pathetic (I think this word is too smart, to be used by people who wear mask 24/7). And whatever else we have been called...... Can you all stop dying if you test positive for Covid for next 29days? Move your suicide, your heart attack, your kidney failure, your car crash to month from positive test. Please!</p>
<p>I want to see my good friend Johnny and snort some C and drink massive amounts of alcohol with him. I can't because of constant lockdown.</p>
<p><em>THIS POST HAS BEEN MADE FOR PURE FUN AND ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES!</em> - because our r/nonewnormal community is STUPID! I had to mention that, right? StUpId!!</p></p>

        <p>You know what's funny?
All the posts on this subreddit by shills like you are personal attacks.</p>
<p>I did that too when I was 11 and way too immature to go on the internet.</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel your anger, you seem to be in cognitive dissonance. You can't process what you read here because it makes sense, while it goes against what your dear government and MSM tells you.</p>

        <p>That's what I meant by that. I see literally not one person in here actually understood. Maybe humor is different dependant on country. As all my friends laugh like this about such thing.</p>
<p>I'm supporting this sub in everyway possible. I hate explaining jokes as they don't make sense no more, but I will for sake of everyone here that do not understand what I mean.</p>
<ul>
<li>all insults I've mentioned have been used by people who support "new normal". As this is basically only way to answer because they can't face the truth. They think they watch the "truth". Yet when I make 100% valid points on why all this is bullshit. Dumbfuck is only answer they come up with. I try to discuss on why others support it all with such confidence. Rarely get answer that isn't an insult.</li>
</ul>
<p>-to stop dying I mean that, same people believe statistics how deadly is virus. Yet deaths are being announced, that are not always from Covid, but when person has been positive tested within 28days. I'll test positive, 27 days later I'll jump off the bridge. It will be "Covid death"..... Okay. Should of waited 2 more days to get statistics down. I have distance to such dark humor. Maybe only 1% now have such humor. As people get offended too quickly.</p>
<p>Yet this community that provides so many valid points. Only argument is "you're stupid fucker, selfish and ignorant".</p>
<p>If you feel like I'm being too harsh and mean in this comment and you feel offended, then too bad. Because the way people are being brain fucked and being turned on each other by government and them biggest private companies that probably even rule the same government and more. So if you still need joke to be more explained. I fucking can't. </p>
<p>Ps. That comparison of your 11year old. Too bad a brain like 11 y/o could make such a constructed sarcasm, that you now 10/20+ years later can't handle and still think I'm "doomer" because of it. Makes me wonder if humanity is actually going in right direction.</p>

        <p>Oh I'm fucked up. I will 100% agree with you. My humor is very different from what I've noticed. I just have a massive distance to everything. </p>
<p>Distance, you get it? At least 2m from being offended and try to laugh at what I can.</p>
