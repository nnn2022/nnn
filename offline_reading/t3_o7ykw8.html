        <p>The CIA along with  Bill Clinton (starting when he was governor of Arkansas) seem to have basically run the US drug trade  from Mena, Arkansas in the 1990s and late 1980s. </p>
<p>I wonder if Clinton’s war on drugs was really just an attempt to lock up drug dealers who weren’t part of his cartel.</p>

        <p>I like your thinking. I'm just wondering how many dead bodies it will take before the average person understands. I remember very liberal family through high school, they would prevent me from discussing politics and they would shun me for having normal thoughts and asking questions. It wasn't until I started paying for my own cell phone and computer that I was allowed to have complete internet access without parental controls and shit to look up my own information. So on some things I'm not fully up to speed with. But definitely I'm glad to have a sound mind and not treating people like absolute crap who want to think for themselves. </p>
<p>That's one of the things that Drew me to this group, was that people thought for themselves and didn't just except what there "Authority" said. I like that you folks refuse to be sheep and actually want to think outside the box.</p>
