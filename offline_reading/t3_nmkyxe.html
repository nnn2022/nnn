    <strong>Why I am Pro-Vaccine long term testing, not anti-vaxx</strong>
    <p><p>People often ask me why I am <strong>Pro-Approved Vaccines</strong> or <strong>Pro-Vaccine long term testing</strong>?</p>
<p>A: I am a simple man. I like my my beer cold, my women hot and my <strong>vaccines long term tested before their approval.</strong></p>
<p>I can travel to Eastern Europe, Middle East, Central Asia, South-East Asia and the Caribbean. Flu shots , Hep A  Hep B, Typhoid, Yellow Fever, MMR etc and 
All of them spent decades being tested before it went under my skin. </p>
<p>I consider CNN the most trusted name in news and after reading this I got concerned. I agree with MIchael Kinch, the author of <em>Between Hope and Fear: A History of Vaccines and Human Immunity,</em>   <strong>"We've got to get this right."</strong>
In fact, I agree with all the scientists and Doctors in these articles.</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p><strong>“(CNN) THE TIMETABLE FOR A CORONAVIRUS VACCINE IS 18 MONTHS. EXPERTS SAY THAT'S RISKY.”</strong>, Robert Kuznia, April 1, 2020, “Eighteen months might sound like a long time, but in vaccine years, it's a blink. That's the long end of the <strong>Trump administration's</strong> time window for developing a coronavirus vaccine, and some <strong>leaders in the field say this is too fast -- and could come at the expense of safety.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Dr. Emily Erbelding, an infectious disease expert at NIAID -- which is part of the National Institutes of Health -- said <strong>the typical vaccine takes between eight and 10 years to develop.</strong> While she is careful not to contradict her boss's timeline -- although she did say "18 months would be about as fast as I think we can go" -- she acknowledged that <strong>the accelerated pace will involve "not looking at all the [safety] data."</strong> </p>
<p>"Because we are in a race here to beat back this epidemic and a vaccine is very important, people might be willing to take a chance on just going quickly into phase two," Erbelding told CNN. "So the 18 months would rely upon speeding things up.</p>
<p><strong>Volunteers in each phase need to be monitored for safety,</strong> Erbelding said. "Usually, <strong>you want to follow their immune response for at least a year,"</strong> she said. <strong><em>But that is not what will be happening in the current study in Seattle and Atlanta, where researchers will test animals and humans in parallel, as opposed to sequentially,</em></strong> according to Stat, a health news website produced by Boston Globe Media.</p>
<p>The vaccine under examination was created using a new, potentially revolutionary technology platform that, if successful, could indeed cut months from the development process. However, <strong>the technology -- called a messenger RNA vaccine -- has never been approved as a product for distribution; this would be the first.</strong></p>
<p>Developed by NIAID scientists and researchers at Moderna, a Massachusetts biotech company, <strong>the  experimental product -- unlike most other licensed vaccines -- does not use any part of the live virus. Rather, the researchers built their vaccine from the genetic information on the coronavirus provided by China.</strong>  Called mRNA-1273, the vaccine uses messenger RNA (ribonucleic acid) to direct cells in the body to make proteins to prompt an immune response that prevents or fights disease.</p>
<p>Offit, <strong>the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, worries that the fast-tracking could cause more harm than good. "Remember: You're giving this vaccine, likely, to healthy people -- who are not the people typically who are dying from this infection," he said. "So you better make sure that you are holding it to a high standard of safety."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fauci</strong>, who did not respond to a request for comment for this story, <strong>acknowledged the importance of safety</strong> in his March 26 remarks. <strong>"The worst possible thing you do is vaccinate somebody to prevent infection and actually make them worse," he said.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Devastating vaccine failures</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>The World Health Organization estimates that vaccines save between 2 and 3 million lives a year. <strong>But vaccine history is dotted with devastating failures, in which people who got a dose fared far worse than they would have without it.</strong>
In the 1960s, a test for an RSV (human respiratory syncytial virus) vaccine failed to protect many infants from getting the disease and led to worse symptoms than usual. It was also linked to the deaths of two toddlers.</p>
<p>In 1976, President <strong>Gerald Ford's administration reacted</strong> at speed to a novel swine flu outbreak, <strong>ignoring the World Health Organization's words of caution</strong> and vowing to vaccinate "every man, woman and child in the United States." After 45 million people were vaccinated, the flu turned out to be mild. <strong>Worse, researchers discovered that a disproportionately high number of the vaccinated -- roughly 450 in all -- had developed Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves, leading to paralysis. At least 30 people died. Upon discovery of the risk, the program was terminated in late 1976. A crush of lawsuits against the federal government followed.</strong></p>
<p>In 2017, <strong>a rushed campaign</strong> -- endorsed by WHO -- to vaccinate nearly 1 million children for mosquito-borne dengue in the Philippines was halted for safety reasons. The <strong>Philippine government indicted 14 state officials in connection with the deaths of 10 vaccinated children, saying the program was launched "in haste."</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Historically, the timelines for bringing vaccines to bear on other pathogens show a much longer arc than 18 months.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>In 2006, the vaccine co-developed by Offit was introduced for rotavirus -- which caused severe diarrhea in infants -- significantly blunting the disease. <strong>The entire effort spanned 26 years; the trial period took 16 years,</strong> he told CNN. </p>
<p>In November 2019, WHO prequalified a vaccine for Ebola, meaning health officials could start using it in at-risk countries, like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where hundreds of thousands have been vaccinated. WHO said it was the fastest prequalification process it had ever conducted. <strong>The story of the vaccine's development is complex, but all told, it took about five years to get a licensed product,</strong> said Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in a recent TED interview.</p>
<p>Even back in the 1960s, <strong>when regulations were comparatively lax, it took four years for the mumps and measles vaccine to be approved,</strong> Offit said.</p>
<p><strong>"The consent form was a three-by-five (inch) index card that says, 'I allow my child to participate in a BLANK trial,' and then you would sign it," Offit said. "That could never happen today. And that's the fastest it could be done."</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergencies programme, said testing new vaccines takes time. "Many people are asking, 'Well why do we have to test the vaccines? Why don't we just make the vaccines and give them to people?' Well the world has learned many lessons in the mass use of vaccines and there's only one thing more dangerous than a bad virus, and that's a bad vaccine," Ryan said. "We have to be very, very, very careful in developing any product that we're going to inject into potentially most of the world population."</strong></p>

<p><strong>PAST VACCINE DISASTERS SHOW WHY RUSHING A CORONAVIRUS VACCINE NOW WOULD BE 'COLOSSALLY STUPID'.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>(CNN) Vaccine experts are warning the federal government against rushing out a coronavirus vaccine before testing has shown it's both safe and effective. Decades of history show why they're right. September 1, 2020</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Their concern that <strong>the FDA may be moving too quickly</strong> heightened when FDA Commissioner Dr. Steven Hahn told the Financial Times that his agency could consider an emergency use authorization (EUA) for a Covid-19 vaccine before late stage clinical trials are complete if the data show strong enough evidence it would protect people. Otherwise, vaccines have had to go through the entire clinical trial process and FDA approval process, which can take months or years.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>When the vaccine making process has been rushed, there have been bad outcomes.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Cutter incident</strong></p>
<p>On April 12, 1955 the government announced the first vaccine to protect kids against polio. Within days, labs had made thousands of lots of the vaccine. Batches made by one company, Cutter Labs, accidentally contained live polio virus and it caused an outbreak. More than 200,000 children got the polio vaccine, but within days the government had to abandon the program.
"Forty thousand kids got polio. Some had low levels, a couple hundred were left with paralysis, and about 10 died," said Dr. Howard Markel, a pediatrician, distinguished professor, and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan. The government suspended the vaccination program until it could determine what went wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Monkey trouble</strong></p>
<p>However, increased oversight failed to discover another problem with the polio vaccine. <strong>From 1955 to 1963, between 10% and 30% of polio vaccines were contaminated with simian virus 40 (SV40).</strong></p>
<p>Scientists wrongly thought the formaldehyde they used would kill the virus. "It was being transferred to millions of Americans," Jain said.</p>
<p>It took several incidents for people to start distrusting vaccines. <strong>Even after thousands of kids got sick from the first polio vaccine in 1955, when the program restarted, parents made sure their children got vaccinated.</strong> They had clear memories of epidemics that paralyzed between 13,000 and 20,000 children every year. Some were so profoundly paralyzed that they could not even breathe easily on their own, and relied on machines called iron lungs to help them breathe.
"Parents were pushing their kids to get to the head of the line to get the polio vaccine, because they had seen epidemics every summer for years, and saw kids in iron lungs and they were terrified," Markel said. Markel said people's attitudes started to change between 1955 and the problematic 1976 swine flu vaccination project.</p>
<p>"You've got civil rights, when people see the cops beating the hell out of people on TV. You've got the Vietnam War where people start to get disgusted with the killing. You've got Watergate when the president is literally lying through his teeth," Markel said. <strong>"That led to a real distrust of authorities and federal government, and it extended to doctors and scientists. And, that's only progressed as time has gone along."</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>A 'colossally stupid' move</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Markel said people's mistrust of the system makes the idea that the FDA would rush this process before late stage clinical trials are complete "colossally stupid."
"This is one of the most ridiculous things I've heard this administration say," Markel said. "All it takes is one bad side effect to basically botch a vaccine program that we desperately need against this virus. It's a prescription for disaster."</strong></p>
<p><strong>"This could do substantial damage,"</strong> Kinch said. Kinch, who is a patient in one of the vaccine trials himself, said the clinical trial process needs to be followed to the end. A too-early EUA for a vaccine could cause a "nightmare scenario," for a few reasons.</p>
<p><strong>One, the vaccine may not be safe. Two, if it is not safe, people will lose faith in vaccines. Three, if a vaccine doesn't offer complete protection, people will have a false sense of security and increase their risk. Four, if a substandard vaccine gets an EUA, a better vaccine may never get approval, because people would be reluctant to enroll in trials and risk getting a placebo instead of a vaccine.
"People are going to die unnecessarily if we take chances with this," Kinch said. "We've got to get this right."</strong></p>

        <p>Not that I trust the vaccines, but I don’t think they took 6 months or whatever to make.</p>
<p>The pharma companies probably started working on vaccines for COVID at the same time they started working on creating COVID at the Wuhan lab.</p>

        <p>The mRNA platform can be quickly modified to create genetic therapy for many things, such as coronaviruses.  </p>
<p>The Chinese provided the sequencing of the virus to western countries for their use in developing vaccines.  Once the sequencing was obtained, it took  big pharma only a matter of days to design the mRNA vaccines.  Days.  Not weeks, months or years.  </p>
<p>To note, Sars-Cov-2 has never been isolated in a lab.  </p>
<p>Me?  I won't be taking the experimental gene therapy designed to combat Sars-Cov-2.   </p>
<p>Also to note, the adenovirus vectored vaccines such as J&amp;J are not a traditional vaccine either.  People frequently make this claim.  Prior to Sars-Cov-2,  there has never been an adenovirus vector vaccine approved for use.</p>

        <p>Now, I don’t think the pharma companies ever tested their vaccines for safety. If anything, they wanted their vaccines to occasionally cause problems so that people would have to use other pharma products during their hospitalization.</p>

        <p>Love this!  Thanks for posting. In early COVID days,  I remember all of the "experts" giving negative commentary about the upcoming vaccine. Now we are supposed to ignore all of these reports and just do our part.   I refuse to get this vaccine for at least a year.  Don't people realize the trials just started in 2Q of 2020?    Cancer, heart problems, blood clots, and auto-immune diseases are a real concern (not just initially but in 2-3 years).  I was in large NJ ER and they said they have seen a slew of weird side effects.   I then talk to a local pharmacist and he said he has heard of uncontrolled asthma, rashes, erratic blood sugar, menstrual problems etc.  Waiting shouldn't be criticized.  These vaccines will be fine tuned and perfected.  I'm happy to wear a mask and socially distance until we have more information.</p>
