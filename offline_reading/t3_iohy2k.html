    <strong>Should We Sue Share Holders, Board Members and City Council Members Individually Over Mask Mandates and Other COVID Measures?</strong>
    <p><p>Yahoo recently deleted some old emails, like literally wiped my inbox clean right in front of my wife. We were waiting on important documents from our new apartment complex and my page timed out once my screen saver activated. Well the page said to refresh and she did but suddenly my inbox was wiped clean. I had work documents from last week my job needs and a whole host of other things. </p>
<p>Well I emailed tech support and told them I will go after the CEO of Yahoo as well as share holders and board members with law suits and within 3 hours everything was back. I definitely intended to follow through but I was wondering maybe if that is something we should do/consider at the very least at this point?</p></p>

        <p>What I read from it is that the threat of suing shareholders of yahoo may have prompted the speedy restoration of the emails, so threatening (and then following through) to sue shareholders of corporations and board and city council members may be effective at getting these ridiculous mask mandates and other measures revoked. Everyone needs to do what they did in Palm Beach, Florida, basically.</p>

<p>I believe that my response was taken very seriously which is why they acted so quickly to acquiesce to my demands. I believe if we start suing these people directly as I mentioned in the OP and highlighted in my response to you we will get swift action.</p>

        <p>As a person who works in online customer service, when we get threats to sue our CEO or whatever, we just laugh, honestly.  Like, go ahead, doesn't bother me any.  </p>
<p>Not saying that suing over these unconstitutional laws isn't a potential route to take, but in customer service, it really doesn't do anything.</p>

        <p>I will def sue the shit out of everyone who has perpetrated this scam,,,  so many businesses ruined,,,relationships damaged beyond repair,,, betrayals of trust,,,those kept from dying and suffering loved ones,,,,,babies born without fathers present,,,,,the elderly isolated from family members...not too mention the thousands of people unable to see their doctors for non Covid related issues.  Physically and mentally...all for a mortality rate of 0.005 % here in the U.S. alone....this should go down as the worst event ever to have done against humanity....this includes Pearl Harbor and 9/11.   The collateral damage will be felt for decades to come....all courtesy of our own government.   Makes one wonder about the conspiracy theories about 9/11 and we already know the truth about Pearl Harbor and FDR...</p>
