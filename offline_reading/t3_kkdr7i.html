    <strong>Protesting isn’t useless</strong>
    <p><p>I hear some people who are against Covid-1984 policies saying that protesting against them is useless, and that what’s best is to not obey the orders. However, how are we going to spread information and get more people to disobey the totalitarian orders? I believe protests, disobedience, and lawsuits all together are our formula for victory. The protests generate buzz and let the more influentiable sheep know that there are alternative viewpoints, and that there are people who push back against what’s going on. Yes, the media will censor, however if you choose certain locations to protest it makes it hard for the media to ignore. Protesting loudly around Government buildings in Washington D.C, such as the White House would be impossible for the media to ignore. Furthermore in each state protesting around the offices and meetings of the governor and their lackies will send them a message. I remember a state here in the US even protested outside the houses of government officials, really sends the message home that the people they are supposed to represent, aren’t happy with the way that “representation” is going. </p>
<p>The failure of other protest movements such as BLM are things we can learn from. I’m not a fan of that movement, but we can use their shortcomings as a lesson we can improve from. The problem with BLM is that they had no legal issues they were challenging, no laws or government policies, in they end they settled with the vague “defund the police” which didn’t make sense and fizzled out. We in the anti Covid-1984 camp have many, many legal issues we are challenging. So we can have effective, simple slogans to challenge that, like “say no to mandatory vaccines”, “no more lockdowns”, “all businesses are essential”, “my body my choice”. The last one, “my body my choice”, relates to the slogan the abortion movement uses, which is to say that if it’s their body (is it? Where is the line drawn? And this is where the debate rages on) they should have the choice. We clearly have that same argument, of bodily autonomy, but it’s much less murky than the pro-choice/pro-life abortion debate. The important thing is, the pro-choice movement has been successful, because as you can see they’ve had concrete legal issues which they challenged. So whether or not we agree or disagree with the movement we learn from its successes to power our own.</p>
<p>We disobey, we protest, and file lawsuits in the kangaroo courts. Yes, the legal system is really corrupt, but it’s far from a fantasy to win some cases which has happened already. The more cases we win, the more buzz is generated, the harder it is for the influentiable sheep to have the wool put over their eyes by the media, and the closer we are to toppling the house of cards that is the Covid-1984 charade. The wealthy elites and criminal corporations who are harming us are not invincible, they’re more afraid of us than you might think, which is why they speak of side effects of these vaccines (a bit but not enough to wake any sheep, ex: freeze your sperm but the vaccine is safe-ish). The Jim Crow laws were extremely difficult to push through, and much of society was oblivious to them, but eventually enough sheep were awakened that society had to change. Same goes for many civil rights struggles in countries around the world, such as India and South Africa. This time the enemy is not institutional racism, but institutional anti-humanism, if that even is a word. So let’s not let our heads hang low even though things look grim right now, just as the elites have brought in this totalitarian dystopia through death of a thousand cuts, we too will fight back for our freedoms with as many gradual victories as it takes.</p></p>

        <p>Everybody should go protest at their local city or town as often as they can. Even if you are alone people will start joining you and soon there could be a good sized

        <p>OP-this is the BEST, most well thought out post I’ve seen on this sub so far.
You are clearly intelligent enough to be able to see arguments on BOTH sides.
A post like this is exactly how society can pull itself together and change the meaning of ‘we’re all in this together’ to mean ‘we the PEOPLE are in this fight for our humanity together’. We need to make people understand that the battle we are fighting is not an invisible virus-but the threat that is clearly visible and right in front of our eyes if we just bother to look. Having an angsty teenage rebellion attitude like wearing something that says ‘masks are for sheep’ is not going to rally the other side to come around to your opinion. That combative attitude just creates more conflict amongst the people which is EXACTLY what the elite wants. If we are squabbling amongst each other we aren’t paying attention.</p>

        <p>It’s frustrating because if you go to protest, then all the doomers will blame you for ‘spreading the virus.’ If lockdowns/mask mandates continue on longer, it’s the protestors ‘fault’ for making it all go on longer. But on the other hand, if you don’t protest, then you’re allowing them to win. It feels like there’s no way around it.</p>
