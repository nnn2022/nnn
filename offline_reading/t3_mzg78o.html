    <p><p>Mental health issues are on the rise cause of these lockdowns. Use this post to express your feels. We’re all here cause we have the same opinions. No judgment here, friends. </p>
<p>I’ll go first: </p>
<p>I’m tired of the gyms being closed. I want to cure my sciatica and for me that’s working out. I can barely move. I have severe neck pain. I’m constantly in auto pilot. I booked a therapy session but she’s so booked up I can’t get in til July. So I sneak out to this nearby field and play music. It helps. I bring my dog. But the police can now stop and fine us, so I go alone. I’m considering switching to another university out of province. </p>
<p>Your turn :)</p></p>

        <p>I posted a long rant that is depressing as hell so I will be a little lighter here....I am tired of not being able to wear lipstick and have normal communication with people involving facial expressions. It feels dehumanizing and like we are erasing our personalities. I’m tired of feeling like I am in a futuristic movie and all of this is normal when it’s NOT. Stop normalizing all of the bizarre things people are doing right now.</p>

        <p>Literally my entire bio family is prostrating themselves before the golden vax, so sure it will save them despite my vocal opposition and bombarding them with data from "mainstream" sources so they can't pull the "there goes Throwawayact69420 with his crazy conspiracies again" horseshit and, statistically speaking according to one of the dissident docs (few were calling it a literal bioweapon), that at <em>least</em> one of them will die/be maimed from it.</p>
<p>My state dictator's doing his very best impression of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping">Chairman Winnie</a> and damn near no one around me seems to have a problem with it as long as it's "for our safety." Can you say "social credit score" and "public health" apartheid? Worst part is, it's a running joke around these parts that the elections are all rigged and people just ACCEPT it as a "fact of life."</p>

        <p>I'll probably lose my DnD group, and I love my character and the story so much, but they all think I should be shunned and excluded if I don't get the shot, even though they will all have had it, be willing to go to restaurants and planes where people might not be vaxxed, have lived for years with people working with the public.  Two of them have already had and recovered from covid.</p>
<p>I hope they might soften their hearts, and maybe allow me to just wear like three masks to appease them and subject myself to the great pain of constant covid tests to prove I'm not sick.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I had friends in my old hometown who said they would still love and accept me, whether they took the vaccine or not, they didn't want to impose things on me and felt secure enough in their own choices.</p>
<p>I really love that storyline, though. We've already been doing it for two years.  I try to keep the slightest hope that we can find a compromise until they calm their neuroticism down.</p>

        <p>The thing is that we shouldn’t have to wear a mask when we know we’re not sick, or get a possibly ineffective vaccine with debilitating side effects, or destroy our collective mental health in order to live life normally. Being able to interact with other humans in public is a right, not a privilege. “Just do what they say and they’ll let you go back to living your life” is a bad mindset because it relinquishes control over your own life to an uncaring and greedy government, and it means you accept that the government can keep these nonsensical restrictions in effect as long as they want. These mandates are still in effect not because they’re effective for their intended purpose (or because “not enough people were following the rules”) but simply because people agree to follow them. Most of the “enforcement” of these guidelines comes from social pressure anyway. These “public health” measures will end once people stop obeying them, not when (or if) we get some magical “all clear” from the government</p>

        <p>You’ve seen govts lift restrictions as covid case improve and you’ve seen it as vaccines increase. You have an insanely higher chance of a blood clot from covid than from a vaccine and the mask all for less spread of particles. Covid is here to stay unfortunately and getting your vaccine and doing your part being conscious allows for us to return to closer to the normal you want</p>

        <p>You’ve also seen governments attempt to implement nightmarishly totalitarian measures, only to fall flat because the local police refused to enforce them. You’ve also seen the corporate media scramble to keep everyone in a state of fear. Me wearing a mask and refusing human contact when I’ve tested negative and been vaccinated isn’t “doing my part,” it only serves to perpetuate the cycle of fear and prevents us from returning to society as we know it</p>

        <p>But lots of the “measures to slow the spread” are largely ineffective and grossly infringe on personal freedoms. Mandating masks for children as young as 4 when they’re already socially distanced isn’t helping. Wasting huge amounts of time and money on sanitizing surfaces when there’s no evidence that’s how the virus spreads isn’t helping. Closing gyms and encouraging people not to exercise or get vitamin D isn’t helping. Closing outdoor spaces and enforcing social restrictions in outside spaces isn’t helping. Case numbers in states without restrictions or mask mandates are declining just as fast as in states with them. I myself am vaccinated, and I would never advocate that “COVID is a hoax” but the truth is that a lot of these things aren’t being done because they’re necessary or effective, it’s because people are scared. Is openly lying about thresholds needed for herd immunity gonna stop the virus? Is inflating death counts to include anyone who tested positive gonna stop the virus? Is basing restrictions on notoriously unreliable PCR test numbers gonna stop the virus? The simple truth is that the government, tech industry, and corporate media want people to be scared as possible so that the pandemic to lasts as long as possible. It might not matter to you, but as far as I’m concerned, the government restricting where I can travel, who I’m allowed to interact with, and what I have to wear on my face, with no regard for whether or not I pose any risk to spread the virus, absolutely is a tyrannical attempt to control me. It doesn’t matter that these are measures “to control a virus that is killing people,” because these restrictions simply aren’t helping</p>
