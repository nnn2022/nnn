    <strong>The state no longer serves it’s intended purpose and yet we still fund it and allow it to tyrannize us.</strong>
    <p><p>The government was created to serve the interests of the population. It is a group made up of public servants who are intended to devote their time to bettering the common good and acting in the interests of the people who elect them as representatives. </p>
<p>Taxes are what the government is funded by. We pay taxes in a sort of agreement where if we hand over a certain amount of our money each year, the government is supposed to use our money in pursuit of the common good and the interests of the people, as I described earlier. </p>
<p>The government was built for us, for you and me. They are supposed to be a direct extension of the people, their actions reflecting our desires and interests at every turn.</p>
<p>Contrast this vision with our modern reality and you will quickly understand that things are terribly, terribly wrong.</p>
<p>The government no longer serves the people and they are no longer an extension of the civilian populace. The government has evolved into a separate class of ruling elites, believing themselves to be the anointed few who are fully righteous in making decisions for those they deem to be below them.</p>
<p>Their actions no longer reflect the common good or the best interests of the people, but rather reflect the perverse, tyrannical and self-serving agenda of the state. </p>
<p>Mass media has become nothing more than state propaganda, reaffirming the narratives peddled by the bureaucratic elite and their hordes of technocratic “experts”.</p>
<p>We hand away absurd amounts of our own money to these people in order to better our lives and the society we live in, here in Canada we are liable to pay up to 30% of our income to the state… and for what? To be tyrannized and oppressed by the very people I am funding to improve my life? </p>
<p><strong>Think about it.</strong> You are handing your own money to people that are turning around and using it to tyrannize and oppress you. <strong>How is this in any way acceptable?</strong></p>
<p>In what regard are we <em>free</em>? To me, it sounds like we are being extorted, conned, tyrannized and deceived by people that are supposed to be <strong>servants</strong> of our own needs and interests.</p>
<p>Sounds to me like the government has completely lost touch with it’s intended role in society and has become a separate entity full of individuals serving their own selfish needs and desires.</p>
<p>We need to make it clear we are not going to stand for this. It is unacceptable how far we have allowed this to go, our apathy and complacency giving them free reign to behave and do as they please, all at our cost and detriment.</p>
<p>We must reform the state and see to it that it returns to fulfilling it’s intended role in society, for if it is no longer doing so, why should we even entertain such a charade?</p>
<p>Wake up to the fact that you are allowing yourself to be played by liars and cons who extort you daily and then turn around and use your own money to make your life more difficult and make your existence less free.</p>
<p>Fight for liberty, as it is undoubtedly a highest order value. A life devoted to the pursuit of liberty is without doubt a life well lived.</p></p>

        <p>They have succeeded in brainwashing an ever-growing number of people into demanding tyranny on the mistaken assumption that it is out of concern for their health and safety- without considering the fact that the tyrants couldn't possibly be less concerned for either.</p>

        <p>The pursuit of the “public good” is one of the oldest tools to justify tyranny in the book. Sadly, due to the fact we have allowed ourselves to become completely lost in a world of comfort, entertainment and triviality, we are liable to make the same mistakes our ancestors made yet again.</p>

        <p>Again, divide and conquer. One of the oldest tricks in the book.</p>
<p>Tribalize the population into smaller subcategories that will be easier to conquer separately, have them wage war with eachother to make their defeat that much easier.</p>

        <p>Lincoln tried to stop it. Jfk tired to stop it. We have to stop it. Some how.. some way. Here’s to hoping we have some lurkers here who start to wake up. I’m slowly starting to see it happen but I also see the powers at be starting to act like a cornered animal... it may just have to get worse before people actually get fed up.

        <p>I think we can fix the tyranny and I think that’s the only way this will end. No amount of running away will work, the state is persistent and thorough. We need to remember why the state exists and why we pay them, a large scale wake up call is in order.</p>

        <p>We need to gain such overwhelming support for the cause that change becomes inevitable. If 75% of the population makes it clear it will not tolerate this behaviour any longer, a crossroads will be reached. The state can either go full authoritarian and impose a dictatorship or they can concede to the will of the people.</p>

        <p>That’s one way to look at it, however western history does point towards the state being a construction of the people for the interest of the people. Large-scale apathy has allowed it to turn into a cancerous, oppressive growth that threatens the freedom and well being of the people.</p>

        <p>thanks for being civil, the entire purpose and design of the constitution was to bring about what you see today.</p>
<p>lysander spooner called out the bullshit about the 'government' and the 'constitution', in great detail back in the 1860s</p>
<p>many other have chimed in over the years including bastiat, butler, nock, mencken, chodorov and many others</p>
<p>the 'people' referred to in the 'constitution' (a debt compact), were the owners (investors) of the the 'joint stock companies' (corporations) known as the english colonies. the english colonies succeeded, where the french and spanish owned ones failed, because they were privately owned.</p>
<p>who owned the english colonies? the 2nd sons of british and european kingdoms. at no time did 'the common man' own any part of them.</p>
<p>it was those confederated colonies that waged the 'revolutionary war', not the u.s.a. </p>
<p>the u.s.a. did not exist until 1789</p>
<p>as it stands, every government on the planet is a 'municipal corporation' and 'we' do not own a single share in any of them, nor do we control or have any power whatsoever over them.</p>
<p>in reality, so called western history is not what people believe it is.</p>
<p>all states are founded on lies, funded by theft and upheld by murder.</p>
