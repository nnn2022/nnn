    <strong>The "Freedom" That We Have is Just an Illusion. In Reality, We Have No True Freedom.</strong>
    <p><p>In reality we have no true, real freedom. The freedom that these countries portray is just an fake illusion. Whether it's these lockdowns or whatever, it just shows we live in no different that a communist/dictatorship state. Anything can happen any second. 1 day we are "free" then the next day, everything is locked down. For what? For a virus that has a 99.7% survival rate. How foolish! Taking people's freedom, mental sanity, and letting everyone getting economically screwed for a virus that has less than 1% death rate. How effing dumb you have to be to submit to this clownery?</p>
<p>Yes. Our somewhat "freedom" that we had, whether it was going to the gym, or just simple things like roaming around in the mall or whatever. That all is GONE. Heck, if your even walking around, these doomers will not leave you, until you put a mask on. Whatever freedom that we had, is all gone now. The doomers who have submitted themselves to the government and the elite, have just proved to the government that they can push any narrative, propaganda and they can succeed with it, no matter what. Why? Because people will blindly and foolishly submit themselves to it. The government right now is laughing at all of us and enjoying the show they have putten. They have played all of Us like the piano.</p>
<p>All this "freedom" that these countries prides themselves on, is all just an illusion. All these restrictions, lockdowns, and clownery that is going on sadly, we cannot stop it. And if we try what happens? Cancel culture, censorship does it's job in destroying you. F it. In the end, it's everyone to themselves and a fight till the finish. And, F these doomers. Hell was made for you blind, foolish idiots. You ruined it for all of Us.</p></p>

        <p>The other day I was thinking about how even if you had absolutely no debt at all and owned your home and land outright, it can still be taken away from you if you don’t pay the taxes. So, effectively, you will always be a slave to the machine no matter what. Unless you want to be an outlaw or a nomad of some kind.</p>
<p>Why did people ever let the government tax them on the land where their primary residence is.</p>

<p>It's all bs. These socialist are dumb idiots who don't know anything. They want to only live by petty government checks and tax the rich, while they don't want to work hard and get ahead in life. Most doomers as we know had no lives prior to covid and were miserable. Capitalism is on the decline, while socialism is the future of this country. Sadly.</p>
<p>&rt;So, effectively, you will always be a slave to the machine no matter what.</p>
<p>Oh big time. We truly don't have any freedom. And this covid proves that now. Heck, you can't even go to the mall now or stroll at the park without a mask without the doomers calling you out for not making. These people are retarded.</p>

        <p>Fortunately I live in an area where people don’t wear masks outside. Sometimes I actually forget about COVID until I go to the local small grocery store, where no one really asks me to put on a mask even though most people are wearing them. I try to just enjoy it for as long as I can but I know some areas are insufferable.</p>
<p>I’m not exactly a high achiever. My husband and I homestead on a half acre where we have a 700 sq ft house that is cheaper and smaller than the homes of all of my peers. I didn’t have any special opportunities and I never had to work terribly hard to achieve what I consider a modest but very comfortable life where all my basic needs are met and I’m able to have a few luxuries as well. I would like to be able to one day stop working at a desk and instead live off the labor that goes into my homestead and barter for what I can provide myself. But I’ll always need money because I have to pay the stupid taxes on land I don’t profit off of because I live there! If it’s because it’s an appreciating asset, why not just tax the gains made when I sell it or tax it if I turn it into a rental (which they already do when you collect rental income)?</p>
<p>And the thing is, most of the people I know who are obsessed with getting government checks (and calling them “stimmies” unironically, an infantile term I don’t know why any adult would use seriously) are doing fine, some of them better than me. They just hate working or they think the world owes them something because they had a bad childhood. Or because someone else has more than them.</p>
<p>I have lived on $10/hr, living on my own, and even though there were struggles I would sooner return to that or live in a damn tent than the dystopian nightmare that TPTB want to enforce on us. And I hate camping. </p>
<p>Sigh. Sorry for the rant. Just needed to get that out lol</p>

        <p>I have thought about a renewal of state constitutions ...  </p>
<p>somewhere along the lines of:  </p>
<p>----</p>
<p>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district<br>
is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes<br>
the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state </p>

        <p>I believe in the (full) assembly of all children, youth and adult human beings who live here and now, all permanent residents no matter the age no matter their place of birth ... each one having the same weighted political voting power ... all permanent residents being invited to participate in the decision finding of all matters what concern the local community</p>
<p>I believe in the wholesomeness, the deep sustainability of finding a consensus, of listening to everyones concerns and not giving up finding a solution until everyone who lives here and now agrees with it or at least is not objecting it</p>
<p>and if that would be too tiresome, too demanding,  I guess there could still be a worthwhile attempt in trying to reach at minimum a qualified majority of 60 percent plus for a decision what impacts everyones lives</p>
<p>I do not see anything more ethical more higher in moral value than the circle of equals ... no one dominating an other one ... no adults dominating children ... no people born here dominating people born somewhere else</p>
<p>we all who live here and now permanently, who chose to live here as permanent residents ... coming together to sort it out, to leave no stone uncovered but to search everywhere for the one tiny path what satisfies all of us</p>
<p>to infinity and beyond</p>
<p>together as one</p>
<p>all human beings as part of the one cosmic family of living beings</p>

        <p>very well possible to imagine how the circle of equals then would uphold the individual personal sovereignty... so that everyone at all times would be given the respect from its fellow human beings to enter into any sort of material/financial/good/services exchanging relationship and or emotional/mental/intellectual thoughts/words/touchings exchanging relationship ... in a mental environment where mutual consent and agreement is valued highest  </p>
<p>what I trying to say here ... once we got rid of federal state - regional state hierarchies and there is only the one real level of interactions ... the local level ... there where people live beside each other as neighbours  </p>
<p>once we stop dominating each other with all kinds of complicated legalese papers ...  </p>
<p>we might figure out how to live together side by side without demanding taxes from each other, demanding anything from each other </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but most logically also make sure that everyone who lives here and now in this local community has some access to land to build its own house and grow its own food on it</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>wether or not one got some money / land / valuables inherited or not  </p>
<p>wether or not one has previously worked so hard to now be able to afford to buy land</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the access to land for self-sustaining could be one of the most interesting topics a self-governing local community eventually would discuss</p>

        <p>To be honest, I don’t feel knowledgeable enough to decide what a new constitution should be or how it would be upheld. I just know that I want to live on my little piece of ground, doing whatever I need to do to sustain myself and my family, without having to continually pay “appreciating asset taxes” for the right to do so. It’s such BS and keeps you hooked onto the machine no matter how far off grid you go. And they never give you a break on the years your property didn’t appreciate or in the unlikely event your property value actually went down.</p>
<p>Why should you have to pay the government for your right to live on a place that you own?</p>

        <p>although I believe that every human being should have access to some land to build a house for itself and grow its own plant foods ... I do not think that owning that land is something what really helps either the human being nor the earthworms who live in the very earth the human being thinks he/she owns ... therefore what I think would be interesting to approach : an understanding of each others needs and wishes ... most everyone likes to be self sufficient and not be dependant onto the moods/goodwill/charity of others ... if we human beings could find it in us to share the land we occupy between us so that everyone could have fair access to it ... and we would not demand from each other any duties nor any financial contributions ... because every human being is a personal individual sovereign ... no one human being has a moral authority to demand anything from ones fellows</p>
<p>the local community being its own absolute sovereign, the people who live here and now as each others neighbours creating the law what is valid here and now in this local community.</p>
<p>as much as possible land could be in the stewardship of the local community, the (full)assembly of all children, youth and adults, all permanent residents together deciding whom could be given a tax-free and rent-free lease of land for a lifetime</p>
<p>the ideal being here that everyone would be given a 1000 square meters of land to use for a lifetime, to sustain oneself by building a house on it and growing ones own food without having to pay anything for it to no one</p>

        <p>Recent estimates conclude ~17% of people are asymptomatic. Let's add on 20M cases then. Now it's a 2% mortality rate. You're still woefully off 😂</p>

<p>me, andreas ... was so happy when I discovered this article some time ago ... since the time when I was a teenager and learned about peter duesberg trying to share with the world his findings that HIV is not the cause for AIDS</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/paper-denying-hiv-aids-link-secures-publication-1.9737">https://www.nature.com/news/paper-denying-hiv-aids-link-secures-publication-1.9737</a></p>
<p>I felt that there is some gigantic corruption ongoing in our human society with the pharmaceutical industry and the medical doctors being in a most unhealty relationship making most everyone suffer from their virus scapegoating politics</p>
<p>the size of the global chemical industry is of such enormity ...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/302081/revenue-of-global-chemical-industry/">https://www.statista.com/statistics/302081/revenue-of-global-chemical-industry/</a></p>
<p>that it does not surprise when in 2020 and 2021 perhaps more than half of humanity is being handled like imbeciles ... most every human being on the planet being forced to wear an air flow limiting face mask, being forced to keep a distance to fellow human beings and most sadly ... being forbidden to move freely outside of ones home, being forbidden to meet others of ones liking</p>
<p>what we are being exercised upon is a show of might ... the centralistic political activists or elected governement representsentants working in concert with</p>
<p>the pharmaceutical industry</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/19/2160795/0/en/Pharmaceutical-Manufacturing-Market-Size-Expected-to-Reach-US-1-173-3-Bn-by-2030.html">https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/19/2160795/0/en/Pharmaceutical-Manufacturing-Market-Size-Expected-to-Reach-US-1-173-3-Bn-by-2030.html</a></p>
<p>to undermine the self-consciousness, the self-worth of most everyone</p>
<p>the goal of this evil plot of world domination by centralistic government initiatives controlling most everyones everyday lives however they wish ... sometimes giving a little more radius on the leash we are kept on ... sometimes tightening up the radius in where we are told we could move within</p>
<p>it is not the first time the chemical industry has tried to position themselves as the saviour ... as humanities only hope against wild nature</p>
<p>its just a bit frustrating for me to see how successful this all works out ...</p>
<p>like how many people seem to believe that their very own body would not be capable of learning from the coronavirus ...</p>
<p>that the coronavirus would be the enemy of humanity</p>
<p>I would not have believed it when someone would have told me in january 2020 that soon the governements all over the planet would exercise emergency laws to forbid people to move freely on the streets, to assemble ... that people would be forced to obstruct their breathing by having to wear a face mask ... that people would be forced to provide their living address when visiting a public restaurant, a dancing club or any other social gatherings, that everyone at all times could be forced by governement threat of violence to test oneself for coronavirus and then being forced into self-quarantine or supervised isolation</p>
<p>i am still having a hard time to mentally process how so quickly the western democracies have turned into dictatorships where so called epidemologists set the pace of opening and closing shops, allowing or forbidding people to move freely, assemble freely</p>

        <p>wether or not there is a secret concerted effort of supporters of the chemical and pharmaceutical industry to use the coronavirus as a scapegoat to train people accepting centralistic governement emergency law being used for prolonged times ...</p>
<p>wether or not there is a secret agenda hooking most everyone up to believe in the pharmaceutical industry being the only hope for humanity to ever enjoy free movement and free unobstructed meetings again</p>
<p>wether or not there is a money making motive behind all this or just a plain global dictatorial approach seeking much more than financial profits but finally to make most everyone give up voluntarily their very own freedom to decide what the want to introduce into their bodies and what not</p>
<p>its all much too much for me</p>
<p>but I am not giving up the good cause</p>
<p>I still believe that we human beings wake up from this nightmare and call them out ...</p>
<p>that we refuse to protect ourselves against the coronavirus, <strong>that we refuse to declare the coronavirus our enemy</strong></p>
<p>imagine there is a war and no one volunteers to fight in it</p>
<p><strong>but instead acknowledge all virus and all bacteria for what they really are</strong></p>
<p><strong>messengers of the whole web of life, carriers of important informations ...</strong></p>
<p>coming to see us, coming to live on our skins, live inside our bodies to check us out, see if we have done our maintance jobs on spiritual, mental, emotional and physical cleaning ... or if they can find some deposits we might have overlooked, some trash we were for years shy to touch but have locked it away into dense blocking clusters inside our organs, our joints and bones</p>
<p>I still do have hope that we consider the life affirming approach, one who appreciates the work of the bacteria and viruses like for example it is being supported by such great research initiatives like this one: <br>

<p>I do still have hope that more and more people see the danger in us allowing the governements to use emergency laws for extended times to herd us however they want ... decide in dictatorship modus who can move how, where, when ... who can assemble where when with whom</p>
<p>I do still have hope that more and more people understand the importance of our breath being unobstructed, of us appreciating the free flow of air into and out from our bodies</p>
<p><strong>may the deep peace of the free flowing air be with us at all times</strong></p>

        <p>but how could we actually change the circumstances, the political structure in a sustainable manner .. so that such a disaster could never happen again ... so that never again some centralistic oriented governmental agents could exercise such dictatorial powers</p>
<p>I believe for that we could try to improve our states constitutions ... aiming for a complete and consequential decentralisation and distribution of political powers towards the local level ... to the level where people are each others neighbours every day</p>
<p>I believe to renew our nation states and regional states constitutions could be the one peaceful and gentle change we could consider...</p>
<p>for example along lines such as</p>
<p>----</p>
<p><strong>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</strong></p>
<p><strong>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</strong></p>
<p><strong>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</strong></p>
<p><strong>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</strong></p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>I believe in the (full) assembly of all children, youth and adult human beings who live here and now, all permanent residents no matter the age no matter their place of birth ... each one having the same weighted political voting power ... all permanent residents being invited to participate in the decision finding of all matters what concern the local community</p>
<p>I believe in the wholesomeness, the deep sustainability of finding a consensus, of listening to everyones concerns and not giving up finding a solution until everyone who lives here and now agrees with it or at least is not objecting it and if that would be too tiresome, too demanding, I guess there could still be a worthwhile attempt in trying to reach at minimum a qualified majority of 60 percent plus for a decision what impacts everyones lives</p>
<p>I do not see anything more ethical more higher in moral value than the circle of equals ... no one dominating an other one ... no adults dominating children ... no people born here dominating people born somewhere else</p>
<p>we all who live here and now permanently, who chose to live here as permanent residents ... coming together to sort it out, to leave no stone uncovered but to search everywhere for the one tiny path what satisfies all of us</p>
<p>to infinity and beyond</p>
<p>together as one</p>
<p>all human beings as part of the one cosmic family of living beings</p>

<p>I completely agree about the vaccine hysterics and how it's being purposefully done but mostly these are just fellow human beings that are blinded to it.  They want to believe the government has their best interest.  They want to believe the media tells the truth. To not believe would cause such a rif in their belief system they may not recover.  </p>
<p>Is it our job to keep trying to wake humanity up?  </p>
<p>I'm worried what the future will look like, but also saddened by this all.  </p>
<p>I know it's hard to have compassion for people trying to take away our rights and freedoms.  But rarely has complaining and calling people sheeple ever turned that tide.   </p>
<p>We need to come together and do something more effective.  We need to at least ban together within our own diverse community with a common goal of saving our few liberties, like body autonomy.  </p>

        <p>the coronavirus allows us to evaluate our very own values ... how do we think an individual human being best would be respected by its fellow human beings ...   </p>
<p>I believe that there are two sorts of very basic sovereignities what are of moral integrity:  </p>
<p>the sovereignty of the personal individual human being<br>
every human being at all times is able to decide what it wants to do with whom it wants to be<br>
no one human being has the moral authority to dominate a fellow human being  </p>
<p>the sovereignty of the local community<br>
the local community what is it own absolute political sovereign, creates the law what is valid within the territory of this local community<br>
all permanent residents, all who permanently live here and now, would best be invited to create these sets of rules what apply to everyones everyday lives  </p>
<p>where love flows, no rules are needed...  </p>
<p>the goal of a local community of permanent residents could be to have as little as possible permanent rules as to allow the spontaneous and or regular meetings between free individual human beings to be designed and shaped like it agrees and consents with everyone who is in this moment willing to exchange with each other goods and services, laughs and words...  </p>
<p>a  highly evolved local community would eventually have a most simple law just saying ... we who live here trust in each others willingness to respect each others personal individual sovereignity  </p>

<p>as for how we possibly could get there in the political reality ... I believe that a renewal of state constitutions could be envisioned </p>

<p>every human being has acquired over its lifetime this or that much baggage on all levels, spiritual, mental, emotional and yes also physical baggage, much of it actually garbage, trash, jumbled up leftovers of traumatic depressing horrifying experiences ... its this garbage what all virus are after ... to detect it and make it know to the human host, hey ... big one ... look here ... i found this blockages, these dense clusters of rejected stuff ... this stuff is seriously harming your overall growth potential in ways that it limits the unobstructed flowing of life energy trough your fields</p>
<p>such an attitude towards the so called health and sickness topic would logicly lead to an appreciation of the coronavirus ... something along the lines ... all virus and bacteria are my friends, I am very thankful that they chose to visit me and help me point out where I have shortcomings in maintaining a clean spiritual, mental, emotional and physical home in my body</p>
<p>what then again would go in direction of ...</p>
<p>I am not agreeing with the global concerted orchestrated declaration of the coronavirus being an enemy of humanity</p>
<p>I refuse to engage in any activity what kills bacterias and viruses</p>
<p>it is my personal relationship to these littlest of the planets children what is of no business of no other human being and certainly not of any governement</p>
<p>therefore is anyone who attempts to force me doing anything what harms my appreciative relationships to the bacterias and viruses what live on my skin and in my body ... anyone who chooses to interfere with my relationship to my little friends ... is disturbing my spiritual balance</p>
<p>my very own belief in the benefits of a positive friendly relationships with all bacteria and viruses also receives support from wholesome scientific research such as for example</p>
<p>https://newatlas.com/science/gut-virome-database-virus-microbiome-phage/</p>
<p>"A general rule of thumb for ecology is that higher diversity leads to a healthier ecosystem," says Gregory. "We know that more diversity of viruses and microbes is usually associated with a healthier individual. And we saw that healthier individuals tend to have a higher diversity of viruses, indicating that these viruses may be potentially doing something positive and having a beneficial role."</p>

        <p>This is a new take.  I know all about microbiome and bacteria.  Whereas I believed the general idea was to increase the good bacteria and decrease the bad bacteria.  It never occured to me to use the bad bacteria as a signal or clue to what growth is needed.  </p>
<p>Very intriguing.  </p>
<p>But let's be honest, to most people, especially people not into whole body consciousness this is going to sound a bit wackadoodle.  And it goes completely contrary to what the pharmaceutical companies want people to believe. "Treat each symptom or ailment with a drug" or "don't bother getting to the root of the matter, we have drugs to resolve  those markers and even more drugs to solve whatever side effects these drugs give you too" and on and on it goes.  </p>
<p>I guess I'm getting cynical in my old age.  </p>
<p>I was thinking more along the lines of a hunger strike.  Something that makes people understand this is a hill I will die on and you are forcing this on me.  </p>

        <p>the trust one human being has built up into life during the 9 months it spent in its mothers womb ... when it shared the same blood stream with her and experienced all what she experienced trough only audio informations and biochemical signals ... this trust into the web of life ... gets weakened nearly from the moment one leaves the mothers womb</p>
<p>its most tragic really what we human beings do to our young ones ... how disrespectful we treat them while they, the newborns are at the maximum fitness level both physically as well as mental emotional ... and we adult human beings could learn so much if only we would let go of the ... " I am bigger/older/richer therefore I will dominate you " approach ...</p>
<p>what I am trying to get at here is ... that the current situation is not only being premeditated by the symptomatic treatment of the pharmaceutical surgical so called "school" medicine and also important to mention ... many people preferring to take a pill then to really look at what is the cause of them being at unease </p>
<p>the whole system is built up around preserving the brutal cruel dominating each other fighting each other paradigm</p>
<p>the psychological challenge here is ... to see the weakness in the fighting these or that sort of bacteria or virus idea and to switch to an all embracing approach ... eventually thinking of how one has spent 9 months in the womb of ones mother ... could assist in getting back to that place where one feels confident enough to boldly say</p>
<p>I have no enemies ... I am learning from every fellow living being ... every one no matter the size ... has some message for me what I can use to improve my fitness</p>
<hr>
<p>I know what you mean with using a hunger strike in supporting a cause what one truly believes in  </p>
<p>but somehow I think that the other approach ... deconstructing the whole fighting the symptoms ... collecting evidence how actually the whole pharmaceutical and surgical  ... kill the messenger ...this incomplete medical tradition is actually doing more harm than good to most people</p>
<p>this madness what has so sadly become such an enormous part of the economy that one could even start thinking somewhere along the lines ... mmmh... hey, what if people really would start trusting in their own bodies capabilities to heal themselves by doing the sometimes real hard work to go to the source of the so called "illness" ... what if people would really stop buying all the pharmaceutical symptom fighting products, surgeries would only be done if there is really no other way, nobody would buy animal enslavement involving products anymore ... etc. etc. people would start working as little as necessary to have more time to search for the garbage inside them to clean it out etc. etc. </p>
<p>what would happen if people really went for it  ... </p>
<p>by not buying it ( the not wholesome stuff ) we could actually really change the economy and create that optimistic future we really long for</p>
<p>its possible </p>
<p>the human being can change his/her/its brain wiring very quickly</p>
<p>and fasting ... to stop eating and only drinking water for some time ... does greatly help in such a reform of ones lifestyle</p>
<p>its all about integrity, believing in what feels to be the truth for oneself
and translating this into ones everydays life</p>
<p>this is the strongest defence one can bring up against any tyrant</p>

        <p>In addition to that ... the damage done with the tyrant restricting most everyones freedom of movement and freedom of assembly ... the damage done by undermining everyones most intuitive choice with whom one wants to be near and with whom rather would like to have some more distance ... by making everyone social distancing ...the damage done by making people inhale their own exhaled air, by restricting the free flowing air with forcing people to wear masks</p>

        <p>While I agree with most of what you said and you have some very valid points all of what you are talking about are dynamic large scale paradigm shifts.  </p>
<p>I am talking about the here and now.  </p>
<p>Here's the thing and I myself get caught up in this too sometimes.  Being spiritual means being more ethereal minded, but we live in a tangible, base world and while these are lofty and valuable shifts we should be making they are only changes one can make for themselves from within.  </p>
<p>I am talking about what can we do here and now on the ground level to make ourselves heard because our voices are being silenced and our freedoms are being dominated and we are being made the brunt of people's self-righteous hatred.  </p>
<p>I want a solution for right this moment in time that works on a base level.  While this is a great approach for everyone to take, that is a journey that starts within.  I've done a lot of this journey for myself.  That's how I stand so strong in my convictions because I know how the body can live and thrive in its own homeostasis.  </p>
<p>Now how do I get the world to see that or at least respect my own sacrosanct rights to body autonomy?  That's what we need to look at.  That's what we need right now.</p>

<p>No. I'm sure you meant that in a generalized way.  I think you're right.  This would be a great solution for the whole "site your sources" thing.  Because it would site the sources.  So much is being done with antibodies right now too.  </p>
<p>I'm by no means an expert.  My expertise is administration and writing.  I even have a small marketing background.   So I would be ideal to gather and sort and perhaps do such a thing.  We're I to have the time. Which sadly I do not.  I'd love to collaborate with someone maybe.  But I'm not even. Sure I have time for that.  </p>
<p>I know we always say, someone should and we neglect the fact that if the need is there, and we see and understand the need and we can help then it is almost an obligation that we do so.  I genuinely just don't have the time or head space for it right now.  But if not now when too?  </p>

<p>but yes, ideas described in a public space are for everyone to consider, pick them up, own them, adapt them, remix etc etc.</p>

<p>about lack of time ... perhaps if one does not spend too much time on elegance of formulation, not care too much about logical composition of argumentation structuring ... but just writes away ... like ... goes on a 10 hours inspired writing trip ...</p>
<p>the thing might be done within two or three days</p>
<p>however</p>
<p>no human being has any duty nor any obligation to do anything </p>
<p>what ever we human beings want or feel we would like to do is just that</p>
<p>a wish</p>
<p>an urge </p>
<p>as this moment in time is only one more situation where a several millenia old system of feudalistic empire style domination hierarchy is showing its inner machinations more openly ...</p>
<p>and why they don't bother to hide anymore but show their dictatorial might in plain daylight ...</p>
<p>because there is a growing alternative ... more and more people learn about the biome, about the virome, consider to exit from all the fighting each other, fighting the little microbeings ... lifestyle and switch over into camp everybody-loves-every-little-thing</p>
<p>and once a certain percentage is reached ... once a certain percentage of people are not participating in the fighting mentality anymore...</p>
<p>the empire will die</p>
<p>its most sure that it will happen</p>
<p>question is only how long they can postpone the dissolving of all hierarchies</p>
<p>oh ... by the way ... I did collect some of my writings in 2020 revolving around the ... decentralisation topic at</p>
<p>archive.org/details/dissolving_all_hierarchies</p>
<p>my approach there was to just go trough all the posts I wrote on a social network site and select the ones what somehow had a connection to the topic</p>
<p>very well possible to to jumble up something like that in a forum wide effort ... something like ...</p>
<p>who wants to contribute some of its/his/her texts/posts to an ebook revolving around the topic of ... the coronavirus is not my enemy</p>

<p>everyone who feels like these or that texts what one has written in 2020 and 2021 ... since the beginning of the so called pandemic but really the beginning of centralistic elements of society starting another one of their big dictatorial shows of might ... uups ...disgressing again..</p>
<p>everyone who feels having written some valuable texts towards the area of...</p>
<p>I refuse to declare the coronavirus my enemy ... I refuse to surrender to the deliberate false flag domination operation ... called coronavirus-pandemic</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and again slipped of the path ... smile</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>okay one more time</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>everyone who feels like wanting to add ones texts ... pro freedom, contra dictatorship... coronavirus is not the enemy ...</p>
<p>texts one has published here on this social media site ... reddit ... or on any other website and or blog, social network etc.</p>
<p>to a list of texts ... the list having the intention to allow each other see the richness of argumentation as well as to share this wealth of diverse informations with anyone possibly interested ....</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>everyone interested in contributing to such a project ... could either compile a list of permalinks / uniform resource locator adresses to ones own texts perhaps with some words, a sentence describing what's it all about</p>
<p>or go one step further and archive these texts over at the wayback machine of the internet archive <a href="https://archive.org/web/">https://archive.org/web/</a> ( "save page now" field )</p>
<p>to make sure that the informations are preserved for the future</p>
<p>resisting any possible attempts of eventual future censorships</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts and ideas.  I truly hope you are right.  But if I've learned anything about mankind it's that we are so afraid of the unknown that the vast majority would much rather stay in indentured servitude; in almost all ramifications of that, even and probably especially our own subconsciousness.  </p>
<p>But I hold a glimmer of hope that more people are being awakened and that there will be a shift.  Hopefully before we destroy our own ecosystem.</p>

        <p>as for the end of servitude ... when are we human beings getting rid inside our heads of the concept that there need to be one who commands and one who follows ... the interesting thing is that with the coming automatisation, the allready happening robotisation of production/services ... the creative self-guided thinking and empathic processes will be eventually be most sought after in the human being ... so the empire will possibly even dissolve itself by not wanting anymore human slaves / serfs as the robots will do that for them ... and the overall rise in offered jobs requiring self-guided creative thinking processes ... might eventually also lead to many people considering ...</p>
<p>starting their own business, starting their own small scale production, offering services without being a branch of a global big corporation ...</p>
<p>mmmh... I have dreamed about scenarios like this one 
in 2017 when I wrote archive.org/details/apatm ... but actually no, the ... ascende perma and the membranes text is much more progressive and bolder, trusting us human beings even more to transform ourselves</p>

<p>I enjoyed our conversations a lot and hope you find all the relaxation to spend your time on whatever makes you feel good ... sometimes it also helps to just dive into nothingness ... shut off all the mental processes and just trust that all is well ... that all sorts itself out with or without me or you or anyone doing anything ... just by being flowing in our inherent connection to source</p>

        <p>Philosophically, "freedom" is at best an abstract defined by limitless options.  At least to me it is.</p>
<p>Take an option or choose a path and on the premise that the choice commits you to a given course, the freedom gets whittled down.</p>
<p>By that definition I see the purest definition of "freedom"- that being having infinite options, as something of a paradox.  To maintain that absolute state of freedom, one must not make any choice... it is a state of perpetual indecision- of paralysis if you will.</p>
<p>In this discussion, freedom is the ability of people to move about as they please with no government controls over that movement.  The Covid situation has afforded the opportunity for government to seize control of our ability to move, to make that its purview in order to establish conditions we must meet in order for it to measure out a limited ration for us.</p>
<p>Of course the condition is our serum status- furnishing out central controlling authority private information with which they will establish a database- affording access to it to economic players- and setting up a system of rules we must adhere to in order to be able to participate.</p>
<p>Fortunately, databases are absolutely 100% secure as evidenced by the fact that computer hacking as a term simply does not exist in language- and you can believe me because I'm congenitally incapable of expressing any sort of sarcasm.  If you do not believe me then just ask and I'll tell you.  No, really.</p>
