    <strong>Not allowing visitors in hospitals</strong>
    <p><p>No one seems to ever mention the number one thing that I find the most despicable part of these covid restrictions. People mention the elderly being isolated in old folk's homes. That's the closest I see to this. The fact that people cannot be visited by their loved ones when they're in the hospital, is THE MOST EVIL THING I HAVE EVER HEARD OF. I'm not afraid of this stupid virus! I'm afraid of, heaven forbid, something happening to me or my husband and not being able to be with each other. Every time my husband has had to stay in hospital I never left his side! Before Covid I had to be institutionalised for a psychotic episode and my husband visited me every day. If I had to be hospitalised now, with my husband unable to see me, I would probably kill myself. There is no reason for this! Just test the visitors! Done!</p></p>

        <p>Agreed. And it's fucking bullshit that funerals were originally not allowed any visitors, now allowed a limited number, while George fucking Floyd had a televised funeral with hundreds (maybe even thousands, idk) in attendance. How is this shit right?!</p>

        <p>The rank hypocrisy around that was a major breaking point to me. My family isn't "allowed" to drive two states away to bury our loved one, but that piece of shit gets a gold goddamn casket and a massive public funeral 'cause he speedballed his dumb ass to death while resisting arrest. Gee maybe my uncle should have gone around brutalizing pregnant woman and snorting fentanyl instead of being an actual good person.</p>

        <p>Thanks.  Honestly I didn‚Äôt know her as she was on the ‚Äúother‚Äù side of the family (my uncle‚Äôs in-laws).  I took my 9 month old baby to meet my 85 yr old grandmother for the first time over Thanksgiving-flew halfway across the country.  She said if she gets Covid the good lord will take her if he wants.  She‚Äôd rather see family than live like a prisoner-thankfully she lives in her own home.  But my cousin and uncle had just come from their grandmother‚Äôs funeral.  It was refreshing to talk to family that is all on the same side of this.  I feel less ‚Äúradical‚Äù than I did before.</p>

        <p>It's  more than just morale and emotional reasons. Visitation and posting a person on duty in the hospital room at all times are how you avoid your loved ones being murdered by medical incompetence. Misconduct by doctors and nurses is the third leading cause of death in this country and kills a quarter million Americans every single year. </p>
<p>2020 is a halcyon year for medical fraud, waste, and abuse. The people whose job it is to hold the system accountable and stand up for the patients are literally locked out of the building.</p>

        <p>My father in law is currently in a rehab facility after a mild stroke and they allow NO visitors.  He was already depressed before the stroke, I really think he will give up and die now.  One of the big issues with this is that it‚Äôs very difficult to communicate with the doctors and other staff.  We have basically given him over to strangers and have no way to support him or speak for him.  Knowing him, this is the beginning of the end.  He will give up totally now.  I am so sad and angry.</p>

        <p>My grandma was in the hospital for 3 nights, and she was so depressed being in there alone. My sister‚Äôs grandma has been in the hospital for over two months, no visitors allowed, and she stopped eating &amp; drinking for 3 days because she just wanted to give up. They finally allowed her wheelchair-bound husband to visit, and she felt a little better after that.  It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting that we can‚Äôt visit our family in the hospital.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I don‚Äôt know. It was my half-sister‚Äôs grandma and grandpa, and I haven‚Äôt really seen or spoken to them personally in several years. I assumed it was because she was basically going to allow herself to die by not eating or drinking, since she was isolated in the hospital. I guess they decided that was the only option to save her. Maybe she requested it; I‚Äôm not sure. </p>
<p>I hope you can get the same result in your situation. This is a very awful time for anyone trapped in a hospital alone, especially elderly.</p>

        <p>I literally just got off the phone with my mom who was in tears because my great uncle (her uncle) has pulmonary lung disease and was admitted to the hospital because of difficulties with breathing. His sister wasn‚Äôt allowed to accompany him inside because of Covid so she‚Äôs sitting in the parking lot with no idea what‚Äôs happening. It‚Äôs so sad and tragic and wrong.</p>

        <p>I'm so thankful when I had my miscarriage in June that things were more relaxed so my husband could be with me. If he hadn't I would of bleed out in the waiting room for God knows how long until someone found me since they only found me a room AFTER I started passing out from extreme blood loss. I'm currently pregnant again and scared to go through another miscarriage as hospitals are on restrictions again. I 100% believe my husband would do whatever in his power to stay by my side in the event we lose another baby, but it scares me to play the what ifs from that day. I very well could of died and id of been shoved in a corner unconscious and no one would of even knew.</p>

        <p>I'm a traveling nursing assistant in Florida and many patients ask me when they can see their family. It's really sad and I don't have an answer. it's such bs. Facilities test the staff and get a result in 10-15 minutes.</p>
<p>There was just a 76 year old man who suddenly died when he was recovering from back surgery. they wouldn't let the family see him in the facility. However they let family in (but only the wife) AFTER HE DIED.  HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE???</p>

        <p>I was hospitalized after a car crash a few years ago. I was with my friend and I was in the passenger seat. We got hit by a pickup truck on the driver‚Äôs side. We were both sent to the hospital. She stayed in longer than I did but I was in very bad shape. I was in for three days and my fianc√© came and saw me every day for hours on end. It would have killed me to not see him. Especially after something as traumatic as a car crash. It‚Äôs so fucked up.</p>

        <p>was in the hospital last week for severe dizzy spells,turns out the label on my medication was wrong. while i waited to even go in the back,was in emergency room,they wouldn't even let my husband in the waiting room. So I sat near the door so he could see me. when i finally went back,minus my husband again i decided to keep my phone on my person and film them as they took tests etc. I was so scared that the dizziness promptly went away, I assume it was the adrendaline. as soon as i felt better i kept asking "can I go now?"They wanted to do a covid test but I declined,claiming insurance wouldn't cover it religion litterally anything to keep them from jabbing that qtip in my brain. They let me go home thankfully but I was really worried they would force it. When i discussed the insident with my inlaws my father in law pointed out that the mis dosing may have been intentional and that terrifies me that he may be right.</p>

        <p>Yup, it's really fucked up and makes zero sense. My father is having some health issues and he's a super stubborn, stoic, 25 year Navy veteran. Unless he's had a few beers, he is very soft spoken.</p>
<p>My mother has been his advocate and voice for their entire 35 year marriage. She's not allowed to go to his doctor visits with him...the man she has shared a bed with since 1985. IF HE ISN'T SICK WITH COVID NEITHER IS SHE!!!!</p>
<p>She is the one that would tell the doctor what's really going on, symptoms my father might not even remember or realize, etc. My dad is the type to just say "Yeah I'm good". It's so unbelievably fucked up that it's making me pissed off just typing this out. </p>
<p>Hey, he might have cancer, but THANK FUCKING GOD he didnt get covid!</p>

        <p>My Dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer (GBM) last March. His health starting declining rapidly early this year. Around April, his health was in a state it was difficult for us even with 24/7 care in his home to help him. Deciding to put him somewhere with more help and possibly never seeing him again was one of the hardest decisions I have ever made. While we were waiting for a spot to open for him, he passed away at home surrounded by loved ones and his doggies which I am grateful for. Even the thought of making this decision was awful and I can‚Äôt imagine actually having to go through with it.</p>
