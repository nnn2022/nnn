    <strong>Do You Know Your Enemy?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey gang! This will likely be my last post.</p>
<p>Thank you for the support and reassurance that I am not alone in my worries or my hopes for the world. Too much time on the internet sinks me into pessimism and I don't want to fall into a trap where I go over the same worries again and again. This is just me, I am in no way speaking for anyone else. I joined this group because I was really worried and needed people I knew I could confide in that would be receptive to my concerns and give me a place to speak my mind. I have found a way to manage my worries and have gained great value from the people in No New Normal. Thank you.  </p>
<p>So, if you would grant me a moment to share some parting thoughts I have had recently, I wish to moral grandstand for you all.  hahahaha. I sincerely beg your forgiveness and request your kind humour. Totally fine if you disagree with anything I am about to say, you are welcome to have your own perspective... which is the TLDR of this whole thing anyway.  </p>
<p><strong>In this group</strong> we are uncomfortably aware of ostracization and condemnation of our perspectives, concerns, and ideas. We take the attacks from our community and the corporate press personally, and are disturbed by the calls for people to "distance themselves from unvaccinated friends and family".</p>
<p>From the outside we may be seen as a group of conspiracy theorists, or murderers, or crazies. When we know that each of the 90k individuals in here offers a vast range of opinions and experiences. We have people from all over the world, different professions, men and women, fathers, husbands, mothers and wives. We have people that are pro-vaccine except this one. We have people totally against all vaccines. We have people that got the COVID shots and still give their support. Certainly, we agree on the same basic principles or else a group couldn’t form, but we all get there in our own way. </p>
<p>Failing to see the forest for the trees, or the trees of the forest, in this case. Is dehumanization at its finest. That this group is not made up of human beings but is a sea of ideology that must be stamped out, either through conversion or force. It does not matter what the binding agent of a group is. Whether the ideas are perceived as evil or virtuous. Starting from the conclusion of condemnation is the issue, rather than giving the other person the benefit of the doubt. </p>
<p>Nor can you possibly know the intentions of the many based on the ideas of a few.</p>
<p><strong>Tangent:</strong><br>
The road to hell can be paved with good intentions, and I don't think anyone has the right to say what is best for another. The N3 critic types are saying "do what we tell you before the Government comes and makes you" whereas N3 is just saying "I will leave you alone if you leave me alone".</p>
<p>Assuming an unvaccinated or unmasked person is a threat is like assuming everyone is concealing a fire-arm, or a knife, or just a bad attitude and looking for a fist-fight. Diseases aside, every human is naturally a threat to every other human at all times. People do great harm to each other all the time, but can never know who will instigate the harm.  We lower that threat by having a culture of respecting bodily autonomy.</p>
<p>All you can do is make the decisions that you think will keep you safest, rather than dictate how others must act. Demanding others wear masks or get vaccinated for your own protection would be like frisking everyone you personally meet at the supermarket. "Leave me alone", is not the same kind of aggression or threat as "do what I tell you". Not everyone is carrying a gun, and not everyone is contagious (with covid, flu, HIV, Hepatitis, Ebola or any other nasty pathogens).  </p>
<p>Bittersweetly, this does mean, as heartbreaking as it is, that your friends and family have a right to distance themselves from you or disinvite you to gatherings. If they only want vaccinated people in their vicinity, they are afforded that right. It really hurts and may seem totally insane to us, and you can try to negotiate by all means! However, personal freedom goes both ways and if they are set on their decision we must respect that, just as we would want our decisions to be respected. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Now if I may call upon your empathy.</strong> </p>
<p>Let us be careful that we do not mirror the behaviours of those that would try to aggress against us. Those on the pro-covid measure side, those that support government, those that criticize N3. Whom ever you find yourself disagreeing with. Do your best to see them as people first, and respect their rights and freedoms. The Golden rule does not say treat others how you are currently being treated. It says treat others how YOU would LIKE to be treated.</p>
<p>You have the right to disagree with them the same as they have the right disagree with us. The day anyone loses the ability to disagree or voice a contrary opinion is the day the world gets a lot worse than the issues we are bickering about, as Eric Weinstein recently said (No not Harvey haha). This even includes people that deny the sky is blue or think the Earth is flat. Think of them what you will but leave them alone. Don’t lose sight of their humanity. All people have the right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression. Don't tell people how to live their lives and don't violate their autonomy (to any lurkers that will rebuke this notion by saying non-compliance is a violation of your rights. Words, ideas, and inaction are not aggression. This starts enabling the concept of Pre-crime and thought-crime - see Minority Report and Orwell's 1984. An act of aggression is someone physically preventing you from getting vaccinated, or snatching your mask off, or involuntarily playing a game of  ooky mouth with you etc.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Please note...</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely none of this is to imply criticism or anyone or any ideas of this forum. Rather, I care about and cherish the values of N3 and am empathetic to its members. I want the best for everyone in here and simply hope to ground the conversation, if anyone resonates with what I am saying.</p>
<p>I am guilty of thinking of people as sheep, normies, covidiots etc. and succumbing to dehumanization. I am not here to claim virtue over any of you. I have been reflecting on my own behaviours and encourage you to join me in this exercise and see where you go with it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>I see this fighting</strong> is getting more intense and might be carrying on for too long. Seeing enemies all around us, at the very least, causes us to be stressed. If we let ourselves get sucked into the vitriol, our seemingly aggressive, tense, heightened demeanor will likely only serve to confirm the biases of our critics, just as the behaviours of our critics confirm our own biases. Lets be careful to not get caught up in games and lose sight of why we are all here.</p>
<p>This does not mean concede your ground, or not push back, or let yourselves be bullied. Hold what ever opinions you believe best serve you and make your own journey. Just, let us observe our own actions so we don’t become the monsters we THINK we are fighting. Don't lose your sense of humanity within yourself OR in others, even if they harshly disagree with you. </p>
<p>Again... we see this a lot these days in many attempts at virtue. </p>
<p>The Ryan Long skit of Wokes and Racists is a perfect example. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev373c7wSRg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev373c7wSRg</a>) </p>
<p><strong>Keep in mind what we want to achieve (</strong>as far as I can gather...):</p>
<p>- prevention of authority to dictate and suppress individual freedom</p>
<p>- The right to informed consent</p>
<p>- The right to bodily integrity</p>
<p>- The right of freedom to choose</p>
<p>- The need for clear data and honest conversation on all sides of the issue (regardless of how bad COVID may or may not be, or how effective the vaccines may or may not be). </p>
<p>- The right to be left alone</p>
<p>- The right to say what we think and freedom of speech</p>
<p>- The right to freedom of movement</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Don’t stop making memes though.</strong> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.</p></p>

        <p>Excellent parting shot.  I will definitely have to save this and keep it in the sidebar and/or pin it.</p>
<p>I know how it is in terms of the mental health aspect though and wish you the best.  You're right though, the harassment we get puts people on the defensive and that will hopefully get better.</p>
<p>Maybe we'll see you around.  Thanks for the wisdom.</p>
