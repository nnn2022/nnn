<title>Anyone stop to wonder if the reasoning for vaccine hesitancy is the fact the rest of the population can actually survive from the virus? Also doesn't help when the CDC still restricts the sheep after getting the vaccine to still wear masks and avoid dining indoors.</title>

    <strong>Anyone stop to wonder if the reasoning for vaccine hesitancy is the fact the rest of the population can actually survive from the virus? Also doesn't help when the CDC still restricts the sheep after getting the vaccine to still wear masks and avoid dining indoors.</strong>
    <p><p>They made it so clear that even when you get vaccinated you need to wear a mask. On top of that it seems like other businesses don't give a fuck if you are vaccinated since you can "still spread the virus to them". Telling people they can't eat indoors, travel, etc. after getting vaccinated is like telling people they can't have sex even with a condom on because you still might get someone pregnant.</p>
<p>Huh? What's the fucking point then? If vaccines do in fact fucking work then people who have gotten the shot would be allowed to do all these things without requirements. Oh and don't even get me started when people use the fact the "Not enough people are vaccinated" excuse. Uhm wasn't the point of the vaccines to "protect" the people who were "the most vulnerable" to Covid? If that's the case the whole reason why there's hesitancy is because the rest of the folks out there who aren't taking the vaccine guess what ARE HEALTHY!</p>
<p>It's been a whole fucking year. It should be established by now that if you haven't gotten sick and died from Covid chances are you have a pretty good immune system. Unfortunately some lives were lost due to Covid, but most people recovered and have antibodies for it! What all the sudden antibodies will disappear? Oh and side note that the people who have died "due to Covid" probably already had previous health conditions. </p>
<p>What we are most likely to die from now is suicides, alcohol, drugs, which have all sky rocketed since the pandemic. Of course it's hard to trust any numbers that someone puts out there because ever since Covid and how the number of cases or deaths have been reported it's all bullshit. We are at a point now where A. The most vulnerable are getting jabbed. B. The most vulnerable and even the ones aren't vulnerable have developed antibodies if they did get it. C. People should be more concerned about the number of deaths after vaccinated rather the number of cases.</p>
<p>Vaccines aren't mean to 100% protect you. They are simply mean to prevent people with horrible immune systems from getting terminally ill or dying from the virus. THAT'S IT NOTHING ELSE. If you are healthy you don't need the shot. Simple right? Well what seems to be happening is that in order to have control, the CDC WANTS EVERYONE TO THINK THAT EVERYONE'S IMMUNE SYSTEM IS SHIT. Otherwise we should be good by now to reopen. They want you to think 30% of the population has been vaccinated. Meanwhile I am sure the amount of people who got jabbed who actually need the vaccine is much higher.</p></p>

        <p>If what you said is true, no one in a household of multiple people would ever get over a cold.  By the time the first person got over it they would catch it again from the last person who got it.</p>

        <p>It's because they can't identify who is vaccinated. and it's not legal for private business to investigate that and they know nobody is going to take the jab without being pressured so they're trying to get infrastructure in place to make private (public) corporations the ability to do that.</p>
