    <strong>How do people do not understand the survival rate ?</strong>
    <p><p>99.8% for the majority of humanity and first you have to catch it. Which has another different probability. </p>
<p>Consider that you are wearing a mask which is claimed to be effective to stop more than 90% of the virus from spreading. </p>
<p>These are low chances for even for 80 year olds with chronic diseases. </p>
<p>If you say people are animals, they will infect others and they disregard the safety of the old, obese and the chronically ill (fact is, these type of people with all love to them have always have been at high risk dying from anything even from the seasonal flu), then you need to study the lifestyle of this niche or segment of the population. Direct you propaganda, sorry, awareness and solutions directly to them. State in you’re awareness campaigns do not panic average joes, your survival rate is extremely high. The vaccines are for the vulnerable. It’s a disease the vulnerable should watch out for. Not all people have the same bodies.</p>
<p>This is clearly not a problem that the world has to stop to for most of humanity. </p>
<p>As cliche as it sounds: logic and rationality never stands in the crowds and I honestly say I was part of the crowd. Fear is the real disease and the modern media is the steroid that will happily turn this fear to a grand dramatic play.</p>
<p>I have recently come to a term in social science called “the availability cascade”:
( an actual small risk perceived by the public as a significant one, which then creates a snowball effect that enlarges the risk image using the help of politicians and the media)
after reading about it one might come to a conclusion that this is exactly what is happening. </p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_cascade</p>
<p>However,I truly believe that the modern average joe is genuinely easily gets panicked. Panic does not allow anyone to think clearly. Add to that the demands of everyday life and the insane effect of mainstream politicalized science which will shut down any opposite opinion goes against the narrative.( remember doctor drew ? )</p>
<p>No body has lived before in a Situation like that in an age of social media and grand global capitalism, where money will gladly mix with blood.</p>
<p>Sorry if my grammar is bad , English isn’t my native.</p></p>

        <p>That's the question really. Everytime I bring the survival rate into a conversation, the conversation usually ends right there. The brainwashed people wont go there. OR, if someone is brave enough to continue they usually start talking about possible disastrous long covid symptoms.</p>

        <p>There was a guy arguing (and being massively upvoted) on another sub the other day claiming forced vaccinations were justifiable because Covid killed .4 percent of NYCs population (1 out of every 250 New Yorkers died in the last year and a half from COVID). A very simple check with the CDC renders the claim so far from truth, several magnitudes lower in fact, but even when another user refuted these claims with the statistics from the CDC, said user was downvoted into oblivion. </p>
<p>These people do not care about science or statistics. It’s sad that anyone has died of coronavirus. It’s a bad virus and it’s important to eradicate it, but we need to be debating using rational thinking and scientific backing. The pro-lockdowners and people who love the idea of vaccine mandates will absolutely not back their ideas with science because these ideas aren’t backed by science. They’re backed by mainstream news.</p>

<p>There’s a really good book written by an independent journalist. A former NYT for 10 years. He goes to an investigation of what happened in the world during summer 2020, highly focused on New York. </p>

        <p>I mention the survival rate and I've gotten "Well yeah that's because of the worldwide response.." as a rebuttal. I say its harmless and they say the survival rate is because of lockdowns and mandate masks... I dunno, man. It seems like the unvaccinated are going to be treated like second class at this rate.</p>

        <p>Yea, survival rate has really nothing to do with response taken. It's the actual rate. Only thing that the "world wide response" could do to lower that rate is if it actually helped the healhcare system and hospitals not get overwhelmed. And seeing the data 99,9% of the places the healthcare system was nowhere near at the limits. And if they were it wasnt due to covid but they were bad already before covid.</p>

        <p>I researched long covid and there really isn't strong evidence that supports it's existence. A few studies I saw relied on online polls where people voluntarily report symptoms, which means the authors of the study had no way to verify if those people actually had covid or that their symptoms were actually caused by covid or an underlying health condition. </p>
<p>But, assuming those people actually did have covid and were suffering from long covid, the most frequently reported effects were fatigue, brain fog, and shortness of breath. Not really that life altering if you ask me, especially shortness of breath. You can just exercise and increase your lung capacity</p>

        <p>Its much higher. 99.9999%  </p>
<p>The virus ran its course over a year ago. There hasn't been a pandemic of covid since may of 2020. The leaders and media have just been calling every death a covid death and using nothing but unreliable tests on healthy people in order to keep the fear going. This gives governments power and billionaires money. This forces people to get vaccines they don't need which brings in even more money.</p>

        <p>You can hold that personal belief, without feeling the need to extend those beliefs to everyone. 95% of women asked years later, do not regret getting an abortion. </p>
<p>Criminalization of abortion doesn’t lead to fewer abortions. It leads to more women dying in unsafe procedures.</p>

        <p>YEA BUT 1 DEATH IS 1 TOO MANY WHEN IT COMES TO COVID DEATHS !!!!!!!!!!!! </p>
<p>and they'll say .02 percent dead is a massive number when you're considering worldwide numbers </p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>People are unfortunately genuinely scared and they can't see how unlikely it is for them to catch the virus and then actually die. I see insane people walking around in painters suits in airports with lab goggles on thinking it actually protects them. Or people can't even touch the tv screen in their seats on the plane. They only touch things with sanitizer wipes. That, in my opinion is the real disease. Imagine living your life not touching anything anyone else has touched lol. It's sad. The media has been pumping covid propaganda for a year+ now and its not going to stop. It's so bad.</p>

        <p>My risk of dying from anything other than "the virus" is higher than my risk of dying from "the virus" - according to covidodds.com</p>
<p>Don't know if anyone else hates the midwit M&amp;Ms example ("if I told you one in the bowl was PoIsOnEd would you still eat any") as much as I do, but you have pretty much the same chance of randomly choking to death on a not-poisoned M&amp;M as you do from dying of covid...so yeah.

        <p>I mentioned this to my boss and he looked at me for a second confused, then shook his head and said “that can’t be right. It’s way higher”. Because any sane person would recognize that if it’s true, then the measures we are taking are INSANE. So for him, it was more likely I was wrong than that the measures are unbelievably stupid. People just don’t want to entertain that possibility after having their lives disrupted and destroyed for a year.</p>

        <p>It's way higher than 99.8%.  Stop giving them far more credibility than they deserve. 99.98% is more accurate (which is a big difference), but even that is a bit higher than the truth. I think a person under 40 who HAS pre-existing complications will still have a 99.997% survival rate, or something close.</p>

        <p>2 things:<br>
1. breathing more co2 in then out causes the body to go to a fight/flight<br>
2. constant barage of propaganda of fear on the news as well as 'cues' via other groceries areas enforcing 6-6-6ft, masks, vinyl glass, etc (Hitler did the same thing of repetition)  </p>
<p>When someone is breathing in more CO2 than O2, they are more easily suggestible. the c.i.a has got this all figured out with their experiments on people in the past, they got this down to a science. this is why logic cannot enter their brain because that part of the brain is shut down and the reptilian brain of survival is dominant, it doesn't hear logic, it only looks to DO things that 'PROMISE' safety</p>

The doctors scanned her lungs and told her she has deep scar tissue and that is how it’s going to be for the rest of her life, reoccurring unbearable pain. She had CoVID in March 2020.
