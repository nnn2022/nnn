    <strong>How to deal with being attacked and hated and losing faith in humanity?</strong>
    <p><p>This might be more of a rant than a question but I do wonder how everyone else is dealing with this stuff. I don’t want to not speak my opinion about the lockdowns, masks, and other restrictions, but I am really bothered by how whole communities of people on Facebook and other social media sites will gang up on me and harass me when I do so. They don’t engage in debate. When I post what I like to think is a well-thought out post, and would willingly discuss our differences of opinion, I have not found any such willingness to listen from the other side. They just call you selfish and post gifs of a tinfoil hats. On FB they keep looking at my profile and ridiculing me for living in Iowa and calling me an idiot, saying I shouldn’t have been awarded a college diploma. I have never been personally attacked this way and it is really upsetting me especially because I don’t call people names or use personal attacks, and try to genuinely debate with them. </p>
<p>I can’t reason with these people. They refuse to listen and just want to cancel everyone who doesn’t agree with them. I have lost so much faith in humanity since the lockdowns started. It is terrifying and mind-boggling to see people collectively losing it over a virus that really isn’t that lethal when you look at the statistics. And to be unable to even discuss whether the restrictions we have imposed are the right approach to the threat the virus does pose, or whether the consequences outweigh the benefits. </p>
<p>Preaching to the choir here, I know. But I never thought people would go along with these dystopian completely arbitrary rules and willingly hand over their liberties so quickly.  I am getting really angry and depressed and I am also worried I won’t be able to express my views anywhere before too long because of censorship from all the social media sites. </p>
<p>Anyway..good to know I have company in this sub and other ones like it.</p></p>

        <p>The same way you deal with any narrow-mindedness (including religious extremism): ask questions; avoid statements. Bonus points if these blow open the illusion of sacrosanct authority.</p>
<p>Why do vaccine companies need indemnity?</p>
<p>Why are big companies open in circumstances smaller ones are not?</p>
<p>Why are pubs outlawed but packed Tube trains aren't?</p>
<p>Why can I go to work with thousands but not meet six friends?</p>
<p>I had this method explained to me by an ex-jihadi who now works as a counter-terrorism adviser. He used it to deprogram Salafi radicals. It can handle headline-reading slacktivists.</p>

        <p>Some days, when I have the energy, I try to talk it out and reason with them. Ask them enough questions and they end up in corner with no explanations for their arguments, cause it doesn't make sense when you apply logic to it.</p>
<p>Most days though I just smile and ignore them. They aren't worth the effort. </p>
<p>Can't offer any thing for losing faith in humanity though, mine was wearing thin before this year and now it's pretty much non-existent.</p>

        <p>You are right and they are mindless idiots. Not much you can do about that, except try to stay positive and find some distractions. </p>
<p>I'm always amazed to see 100's of mask wearing zombies every time I go to the supermarket and they're all obsessively staring at me. Two months ago I was too timid to go mask-less but nowadays I get a buzz from it because I know it really pisses them off and some of them will gain the courage from seeing me doing it, to do the same themselves. Leading by example is a good route imo.</p>

        <p>I second ask questions, avoid statements. </p>
<p>I tried the logical statement route. </p>
<p>But Karen would become rabid and just go off on a grandma killer tangent. </p>
<p>For example: BUT 11 MILLION are DEAD 
Me: well only 250000 are dead in the u.s. </p>
<p>that didn't lead to anything but oh so you don't care about dead people 1?1?1?</p>
<p>but playing dumb and asking redundant questions to make people have to think about what they are saying makes way more sense </p>
<p>I could've said: I thought it was only 250,000? </p>
<p>the person would've still covid raged at me but they would've been discredited and looked dumb and forced to clarify that yes 11 million have no died in the u.s </p>
<p>or if someone says HOSPITALS ARE AT CAPACITY!!!!!!!!! </p>
<p>and you say: I actually read that they weren't? also aren't they usually at capacity during cold and flu season? its so sad that our hospitals were always this bad. </p>
<p>they might covid logic you again but you can keep going until they have no choice to accept defeat. </p>
<p>at which point you may be accused of being a TRuMp sUppOrTer grandma killer but you can always just apologize and say you don't understand why they're angry, you're just repeating what you read. </p>

        <p>Leave Facebook and any other social media and find like minded people who you can talk to and hang out with in real life. I left in March and do not regret it at all and this strategy has kept me sane.</p>

        <p>I now use social media very lightly, and only because I have a very large family and close friends in all corners of the world so it is easier to communicate with them on the social media messaging platforms or blast a message on my wall for them to see. But with the current cancel culture climate, I stopped sharing opinion articles/ photos/ memes/ etc. on my social media. I still live my life and spend time with friends who have the same mindset. This way, if you're not comfortable seeing me, you don't have to and I will not force that upon anyone. Will I go out of my way to keep a friendship with someone who locks themselves in their house and ridicules anyone who doesn't do the same? No.</p>

        <p>The easiest way to deal with it is to completely ignore the COVID cultists.  Debating them is a waste of time.  Don't do it.  Just try to find other people who think like you do and hang out with them.  This entire time I've been hanging out with my friends.  None of us give two fucks about any of this shit.</p>

        <p>Online, it’s the mainstream opinion and the majority of people conform like good little mindless drones. But in real life, I would say it might be around 50/50 depending where you live. My mom treats the news like it’s the gospel of life, anything they spew out is always true. If I dare question anything, she gets angry and calls me a selfish naive Trump supporter. Firstly, we aren’t even American. Secondly, I’m a centrist and she knows that. She watches too much CNN, anything bad is somehow linked to Trump now.</p>
