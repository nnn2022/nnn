    <strong>Calculating an infection fatality rate for covid</strong>
    <p><p>I want to calculate an Infection Fatality Rate for covid from the raw data.  Then numbers used here are from <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</a></p>
<p>Total worldwide recovered covid cases are 144,966,267<br>
Total worldwide covid deaths are  3,436,764 </p>
<p>Adding both of these together gives us 148,403,031 total people recorded to have had covid.</p>
<p>If we take the total recorded covid deaths (3,436,764) and divide it by the total number of people recorded to have had covid (148,403,031) then we get an Infection Fatality Rate of .023%.  From this data, all people of all ages around the world have a .023% chance of dying with covid.</p>
<p>This is about double the fatality rate of the regular flu which is commonly said to be about .01%.  </p>
<p>However, there are two key grey areas in all of this that must be noted.  First, as we all should know, it is quite possible that covid deaths have been over counted, because dying <em>with</em> covid is much different than dying <em>from</em> covid.  And second, the total number of recovered cases are only of people who have voluntarily been tested and counted.  It is impossible to know the true full number of people who have had and recovered from covid.  The higher than number is then the lower the Infection Fatality Rate will be.  So .023% is our benchmark Infection Fatality Rate but if the true covid death number is lower and the true covid recovered number is higher then this Infection Fatality Rate would be even lower.</p>
<p>Please let me know you think of these calculations of the Infection Fatality Rate and my thoughts on why it may be even lower than we have the ability to calculate.  If you think there is an error in my calculations please let me know.  The accurate truth is the goal.</p></p>

        <p>Just here for the math. “Percent” means “out of 100”. So using your numbers: </p>
<p>3,436,764/148,403,031 = 0.02316. </p>
<p>Convert to percent: 0.02316*100 = 2.316%</p>

        <p>So as always, it really boils down to how good the raw data is. My gut tells me that the data is likely inflated, but to what degree could be impossible to ever determine.</p>
<p>I think it might also be instructive to compare your numbers to other common causes of death, like heart disease, auto accidents, etc. Then also compare the total number of alleged COVID deaths to all other causes of death.</p>
<p>Sorry, I didn't mean to give you more homework.</p>

        <p>You can only do this accurately by factoring in age and comorbidities.</p>
<p>Number of people aged 0 - 17 that have died in the USA since the "plandemic": 295</p>
<p>Number of people aged 50 - 64 that have died in the USA since the "plandemic": 89,227</p>

        <p>That is true if you want to get an Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) for each age category.  But here I'm just concerned with an overall IFR for all people of all ages.  0.023% for all ages as I have calculated is very low even for including all ages.</p>

        <p>If either your numerator or denominator are based on pcr as a diagnosis, and they both do, they're going to be way off, ruining the result. Pcr will let far more deaths be counted than really are, but also far more cases. Even then, with nonrandom sampling and a lack of modeling, the case counts will likely be low, but we have no idea by how much. At any point so far, anyone claiming to have an accurate ifr is almost certainly wrong.</p>
