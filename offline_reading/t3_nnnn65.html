        <p>Please don’t take this vaccine. Survival rates for the animals in the compilation I linked are much worse than survival rates for covid. </p>
<p>Viruses naturally mutate until they become weaker and weaker and eventually die out. There is no indication that this issue with mRNA therapy has been fixed with this vaccine. </p>
<p>It’s a risk vs benefit scenario and the risk isn’t worth it.</p>

        <p>Antibody dependent enhancement usually isnt seen in the animal subjects for 18 to 24 months. </p>
<p>We have about 10 to 18 months more months to see if people started dying off enmass. </p>
<p>If ADE is developed in COVID vaccine recipients, all it will take is exposure to the COVID virus and severe illness and/or death for hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>40% of phase 3 trials fail due to safety concerns or lack of efficacy. Considering the animal trials were almost non existent and the phase 1 and 2 trials were incredibly rushed, that 40% number is probably higher in this case.</p>
<p>I am not antivaxx, but I wouldn't even remotely consider getting these experimental injections for at least another 5 years.</p>

        <p>If this virus indeed has been lab spliced with subtypes of influenza (including 'bird flu'), HIV, and several human coronaviruses (MERS, OC43, HKU1), and this was the blueprint for the vaccines that are now seen as probably able to reach cell nucleus, messing up DNA, upon injection, ADE is then likely triggered not only by reinfection of a SARS2 mutation, but also possibly upon reinfection with mutations of these inserted extras like influenza. As it stands now, it looks all very intentional. Within 2 years, people will start dropping like flies. That's probably what Gates meant by announcing the next virus will be even more deadly. It's a culling alright.</p>

        <p>I think the downvotes are coming from shills.</p>
<p>Shills don't want good answers seen, so they downvote questions. And the subsequent good answers.
Shills want the sub maligned. So they prefer the good stuff hidden and the crap at the top. Then they goto NNNBan and say "Look at the crazy racists! I cant believe they actually think this!"</p>
<p>If you were a shill, how would you try to discredit this sub?</p>

        <p>I knew about ADE but that Table 1 gave me chills. Holy shit. It makes me wonder about what will happen in the fall when the vaxxed are exposed to real flu or even just colds/covid. I am worried that they will blame it on a NeW mUtAnT VaRiAnT and the "unvaxxed" spreading it somehow (cause that makes sense).</p>

        <p>I think you’re spot on. I don’t think it’ll be immediately realized—if ever—that the extreme reactions are from the vaccine, NOT the virus. </p>
<p>Plus this info about self propagating/self disseminating vaccines...give the vaccine to one person, and that spreads to many, many people who don’t even need to get jabbed to receive the vaccine. We need a viral vector for this self-disseminating vaccine...well, booster shots in the fall are going to be combined with the flu shot. Great! Now we all have the vaccine even if we don’t consent. </p>

        <p>That all really sounds insidious but I think staying in your house is not the way to go. Fresh air and the sun is crucial for the immune system! I don't know how it will be like, but I am basically priming my immune system for it (cleanest diet I've ever had, exercise, lots of sunshine to the point of being tan as a very fair skinned person, good sleep, positivity).</p>

        <p>I know it’s not good for me, but hell...if this self disseminating vaccine does what I suspect it does, it totally subverts the immune system so it doesn’t matter how resilient it is. </p>
<p>You might want to look into nano silver. A friend of a friend, Rima Laibow, apparently used it to cure ebola and is now touting its use as a COVID cure. I’m not sure how it works, admittedly...she claims it keeps the virus from attaching to ACE 2 receptors but I don’t understand the chemistry involved. They (FDA) are now suing her over the nanosilver cure—she only claimed it cured her COVID. </p>
<p>Anecdotally, I have cystic fibrosis, a severe lung disease. I got COVID and used nano silver and a host of other things and got over the infection in 3 days with no long term damage. See post history if you’re curious. </p>
<p>In seriousness, I will take nano silver before and after leaving the house. I don’t know how much I have to take to turn blue, but I’ll take my chances 😆</p>

        <p>Supposedly they all died, some in a few weeks, some in a few months. Factor in they have a fraction of human lifespan, humans may die in a few years. This may be why Michael Yeadon gave the 2 yr estimation, adding that "3 years is generous".</p>

        <p>Is it confirmed ADE always triggers? </p>
<p>I do know mRNA therapy had many, many failures where ADE ends up developing. Supposedly this did not happen in human trials for the COVID vaccine, or at least it hasn't been observed yet.</p>
<p>I'm still hesitant. If we make it to flu season and people don't all start dropping dead I'll feel more comfortable.</p>

        <p>To my fellow NNN:</p>
<p>You have downvoted someone for having an opinion and thought process other than your own. This caused him to likely delete his comments or get removed by Reddit as suspicious spam.</p>
<p>I went to a regional sub and said "Hi. Would you like to know why I think the way we do?" and got so heavily downvoted I was shadowbanned and all of my comments removed.</p>
<p>We are trying to make people understand us, not necessarily agree with us. In September they will be the ones who may or may not object when medical apartheid comes.</p>

        <p>Because anyone who takes it has their days numbered. You’ll notice in the coming months that you’re sick a lot more than usual and the severity of your immune response is through the roof. This winter will be especially brutal for you and anyone else who has taken it. Peoples’ gullibility will be their demise and I suggest anyone reading this who has not taken it to NOT take it. Survivability rates for COVID for  people in this commenter’s age range is something like 99.991%, whereas the survivability rate for people who have taken the shot declines drastically as time goes on. I predict average lifespan after the shot to be 2 years. Please read what I linked and think critically about what you want to do.</p>
