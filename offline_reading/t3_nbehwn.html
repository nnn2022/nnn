    <strong>Can someone explain this section in Pfizer Vaccine Document</strong>
    <p><p>Hello, </p>
<p>I have no medical knowledge whatsoever so this is just me trying to understand. </p>
<p>I’ve heard a lot about vaccine shedding in the past couple of weeks from multiple sources however I came across this Pfizer document. In section 8.3.5 it is stated that:</p>
<p>8.3.5.1. Exposure During Pregnancy
An EDP occurs if:</p>
<p>• A female participant is found to be pregnant while receiving or after discontinuing study intervention.</p>
<p>• A male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a female partner prior to or around the time of conception.</p>
<p>(Does this mean a male participant who has discontinued to take part in the story can expose a female partner?) </p>
<p>• A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of environmental exposure during pregnancy:</p>
<p>• A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact.</p>
<p>• A male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception.</p>
<p>Does this mean I can get „exposed to the vaccine“ just from being around somebody who has been vaccinated? If yes, how would that be possible? </p>
<p>I’ve posted this before in a more conventional subreddit and I received the answer that this would be a regulation for the event that someone would actually touch the vaccine or inhale it. Just the wording seems a little odd. </p>
<p>Here is the link to the entire document:</p>
<p>https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/2020-11/C4591001_Clinical_Protocol_Nov2020.pdf#page67</p>
<p>Thanks a lot guys.</p></p>

        <p>My wife had intense cramping she said felt like labor pains after spending an hour, masked, interviewing a vet who had been vaxxed two days prior. She is always regular and tracks her cycle on her phone, these irregularities are huge red flags that too many people are dismissing as ‘coincidence’. No. These shed spike protein which are said to cause damage throughout the body and vascular system. Stay away from the recently va xxed especially if you are pregnant</p>

        <p>Hey great questions. However, this document from Pfizer are the protocols that they established to do the research (trials) on their vaccine. </p>
<p>So this document does not contain any conclusions on what the vaccine does in terms of efficacy or side effects. It's just a starting point where they put on paper how they are going to do the actual research to study the vaccine.</p>
<p>If you want to know more on the side effects you should read the research paper that has been published with the results. this paper just shows the set-up and "rules" that the researchers had to adhere to when doing the trials. </p>

        <p>This is the only vaccine that has this type of information. This would imply that somehow, pregnant women could be exposed to the intervention (i.e. the covid vaccine) through skin contact, or even inhalation, from others, although there is no official scientific rationale for this whatsoever. How would mRNA or proteins spread through the air, or the skin? You'd have a white residu everywhere if it would be the case. </p>
<p>This has now fed countless conspiracy theories online, which leads me to consider that this might actually be a planned psyop, in order to get people scared and divided. Divide the masked/vaxxed from the unmasked/unvaxxed. They use every opportunity to divide, opportunistically or planned. This Pfizer info also indirectly supports the idea of transmissible diseases, which I firmly believe is a lie, due to germ theory being false. Viruses do not spread nor cause sickness.</p>
<p>So, I'm skeptical, but undecided still.</p>

        <p>Something else comes to mind here, now that you’re mentioning it. I’ve came across a document from I believe the west Australia government a couple of weeks ago who labels the covid vaccine „poison“ officially on their public site. They have however removed the corresponding pdf document put you can still see it, which seems a bit too obvious not to have been put there on purpose or by mistake. </p>
<p>https://www.wa.gov.au/government/publications/public-health-act-2016-wa-instrument-of-authorisation-authorisation-supply-or-administer-poison-sars-cov-2-covid-19-vaccine-australian-defence-force-no2-2021</p>
<p>If this was put out to cause division it wouldn’t surprise me. The amount of division there is already is immense. </p>
<p>Do you have any information or documents supporting the „virus do not spread“ claim? I’m interested.</p>
