    <strong>For the future of humanity</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been thinking of these side effects of the vaccine are truly real won’t this mean many people will not be able to have kids in the future and many dreams and aspirations will be ruined? I truly feel for these people as much as they hate me for not getting it. I wish it didn’t have to be this way and if this is true and you want a future you potentially have to look for only non vaccinated people which cuts you off from potentially cool people who did take it. I wish this whole thing was fake but I can’t convince myself to take the vaccine and it hurts.</p></p>

        <p>Look, there are many plausible clues that we are in the biblical endtimes, where the masses are completely deluded, totally focused on sinful activities, thinking evil is good and good is evil, accepting satanic agendas, where truth is seen as lies and lies are considered truth. Days of Noah. </p>
<p>The prophecy of the Mark of the Beast seems to be very close, i.e. a chip implanted required to buy and sell. Musk's Neuralink latest implantable head-chip combined with patent 2020060606 (666), which is a biosensor connected to a cryptocurrency system, is able to connect a chip to buying and selling. This fits the bill. As soon as this will be required, you can bet your ass we are very close to the end. I, as a believer, am already convinced we are, but this should even bring unbelievers over to believe in God and the Bible.</p>
<p>This is about good versus evil in the end. You need to make a choice, and live with the consequences. God bless.</p>
