        <p>I think most of this subreddit is people who understand what Covid is and the actual facts about how dangerous it really it is. We understand the risks and just feel like everyone should be able to live their life the way they want without woke keyboard warriors yelling on every ‚Äúpopular‚Äù Reddit post that we are a bunch of science denying, flat earth, racists. It‚Äôs really just a space where we can speak our mind without being banned for having an unpopular opinion. There is a large spectrum of views about Covid on here. Personally I‚Äôm someone who thinks getting rid of more people might not be bad for the planet. We have been cheating death for too long and prolonging life to the point of overpopulation. The Earth will find a way to heal itself from the parasites know as humans. I am a strong believer that if it‚Äôs my time then it‚Äôs my time. I live by faith over fear and will not spend what could be my last moments of living hiding in my home away from everyone and everything I love. I‚Äôm NOT sorry if that makes me sound selfish or stupid. I don‚Äôt give a fuck. And most of the people on this sub don‚Äôt give a fuck either. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

        <p>I've been alive almost 60 years.  I have never seen such a concerted global propaganda campaign.  There have been PSAs every 20 minutes on every possible media, 24/7.  Signs everywhere.  Senseless, illogical rules:  Stand 6' apart in the airport terminal, but then sit 6" apart on the airplane, and pretend it's safe to drink your diet coke and eat your snack despite being in the most serious pandemic in human history, with the most deadly virus ever.  Safe to shop in Walmart, but not to teach in school.  Etc., etc.</p>
<p>Ever changing goalposts--no masks, any "face covering", tightly fitting mask, two masks, etc.</p>
<p>Vaccines hyped to the max.  Coerced, even.</p>
<p>If this were the most deadly event in human history, it wouldn't have to be sold so hard.  We would all be in terror not because of what the media or government has told us, but because of what we would see with our own eyes.  And I don't mean the early videos from China.  I mean daily reality.</p>
<p>My company has 300 people.  We've had probably 10 "cases" (meaning positive test results), with some saying they had mild symptoms.  One person had open heart surgery a few years back, so some underlying conditions there.  He went to the hospital for a day.  Fully recovered.</p>
<p>If this were truly as deadly as the WHO made it out to be, we should have at least several employees who died from it.</p>
<p>It all seems overblown.  We have employees who reported their relatives died "from COVID" but as soon as they start talking about it, you learn that they were either very old, or overweight, or had bad hypertension, or whatever.</p>
<p>I don't doubt there is a new Coronavirus strain that emerged.  The unprecedented response and stunning hypocrisy has me wondering.</p>

        <p>I am tired of the ‚Äúsettled science‚Äù on masks, hyperinflated case numbers, these ‚Äúsafe‚Äùemergency use vaccines, and the propaganda we hear over and over every day. We live life at our own risk, and that means having the ability to make decisions about our own risks. If you are terrified of catching Covid, stay home, wear a mask, whatever you want to do. I want to be able to live life, it is my choice. </p>
<p>If this were really about our health, where was the push for people to get healthy, get their diabetes under control, and lose weight. Instead they closed the gyms and locked us down. Covid has been an issue here in the US because many here extremely unhealthy. The Covid bill going through Congress is a Trojan horse bill full of pork. Covid has been perverted into a political tool.</p>
