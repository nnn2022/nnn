    <strong>I don't even care anymore that operation lockstep was presented as a fictional scenario</strong>
    <p><p>I'll keep this real simple and easy to digest.</p>
<p>As most of you here know, the Rockerfeller Foundation published a document with potential world treathening scenarios and their plans to solve these crisis situations if they'd ever occur.
One of these scenarios is very similar to our situation now but has an interesting section that a lot of people forget about.</p>
<p>They call us conspiracy nuts while the official RF Foundation document talks about citizens being controlled by the government in a tighter way and using unfair methods to control these people and tone down their mobility significantly.
Then after that, the citizens will, according to their words, realize withing about thirteen years later that the government purposely drew more power from them and that they have been restricted, causing the to rebel but it would have been too late.</p>
<p>We all know that the Rockerfeller Foundation has a lot of influence on the world.
EVEN IF THIS SCENARIO IS FICTION, WHO THE FUCK WANTS AN ORGANISATION, WRITING STORIES LIKE THAT TO WORK WITH OTHER BIG COMPANIES AND INFLUENCE OUR LIVES?</p>
<p>It is so flabbergasting to me that people actually don't look at the crazy shit the big OFFICIAL companies say and write.</p>
<p>Thanks, needed to rant.
Sincerely Randy</p></p>

        <p>Most people have a limiter in their brain that makes them think everyone behaves and thinks like they do.</p>
<p>People like us (critical thinkers) are rare these days. </p>
<p>Just be glad that you aren't alone. That's what I keep telling myself.</p>

        <p>If I remember correctly, they werent even talking about dealing with such situations but how to use them. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nommeraadio.ee/meedia/pdf/RRS/Rockefeller%20Foundation.pdf">"Scenarios for the future of technology and international development"</a></p>
<p>Is the title for those who dont know. Its not "How to deal with major threats to human society" or anything like that.</p>
<p>But even if it was as you said, I wholehearly agree with you.</p>
<p>The sad truth however is, that they very clearly tell you how they plan to "govern" the world and people are either completely clueless or cant comprehend it.</p>

        <p>While I was reading the four scenarios I felt that I could relate examples given from each of them to real life occurrences. The news headline sections seriously made me question how many times I had read something eerily similar and never thought twice about it. Personally I came away wondering what the big difference was between all of them bc they all have major relevance. Do you think that all four scenarios are relatable to the situation today or do you believe lockstep is the only similar scenario?</p>
