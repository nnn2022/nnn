        <p>Remember, cops bad.</p>
<p>Except when arresting people for saying "maybe these rules are a bit overboard" and still following the bs rules.</p>
<p>But then cops bad when arresting rioters.</p>
<p>And good again when they get called on a kid with a nerf gun in his room, sitting there, menacingly.</p>
<p>And individual rights good. We need to call orange man a dictator.</p>
<p>But if you question anything else, you should be quarantined in a camp, for your own health. You know, so you can concentrate on what you did wrong. Maybe do some work while you're there.</p>

        <p>This is not a drill.  This is a totalitarian police state, and it has widespread public support.  This is what pure evil looks like.</p>
<p>&rt;Police believe a 44-year-old man from Burwood East was one of the main organisers of the rally. He is still in custody tonight and is expected to be charged and his home searched.</p>
<p>&rt;One other person was also arrested for assaulting police during today's protests.  "Police were disappointed that many protesters were aggressive and threatened violence towards officers," a Victoria Police statement said this afternoon.  "There were no injuries to police that have been identified at this time."</p>
<p>These people are bravely fighting back despite the risk of fines, violence, or arrest.  We need to be doing the same in the rest of the world until every restriction is removed.</p>

        <p>The tyranny that's being imposed in Victoria is objectively far worse than anything Trump's done or even contemplated. Trump himself is instinctively authoritarian and is at best a fair-weather friend of human liberty, but this really serves to expose how little these people actually care about dictatorships, as opposed to just hating Trump personally.</p>

        <p><em>Trump himself is instinctively authoritarian and is at best a fair-weather friend of human liberty</em></p>
<p>I agree. People, though, tend to have naive views of how authoritarianism is going to develop in the "modern" world, i.e. it's not 1930 any more. It's going to come from a larger and larger state apparatus, as we see with Covid. It's not going to come, in a major western democracy like the US especially, from a coup in which the well-trained military, having sworn an oath to the constitution, just decides to support an unelected President for all time, thereby destroying the country as they know it.</p>
<p>It's just fucking naive, but Trump has made the lib-left so bonkers that they think the US system of government is just going to <em>fall apart</em> because Trump waves his finger a certain way. I'd like to say to them:</p>
<ul>
<li>"bad" judges are not dictatorship</li>
<li>a kurmudgeonly Senate is not dictatorship</li>
<li>Trump not caring about you and lying is not dictatorship</li>
<li>the military has been what it is now for many decades; but they care about their country and "freedom" and are not going to support a coup (if I'm wrong here, well I want to be wrong)</li>
<li>an ugly and contested election season is not a dictatorship (see Bush vs Gore 2000)</li>
<li>thousands of people on Twitter who utter scary political thoughts are not a dictatorship
Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>They've talked themselves into this extreme line of thought because Trump mumbles so much bullshit, and via a bunch of overwrought "historical analysis" at the <em>Atlantic</em> and their favorite podcast -- while governments as they are now, no change required, just continue to trample on people.</p>

        <p>So, Trump followers actually believe that he's going to deploy the     military across the US, "pretending" to prepare for deployment of     the covid vaccine. But, in "truth", he'll be using the military to     take out "liberals" and "leftist governors".  </p>
<p>This isn't just cognitive dissonance, this is lunacy. The only     "positive" one can read from this is that, at least it does now     appear that Trump followers do admit that he lies and now weave this     into their wild beliefs...  </p>
<p><strong>Trump’s “military” deployment of vaccines on         Nov. 1 is a clever cover story to prepare for Insurrection Act         invocation, mass arrests using military police</strong><br>
<a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-09-13-analysis-trumps-military-deployment-of-vaccines-insurrection-act.html">https://www.naturalnews.com/2020-09-13-analysis-trumps-military-deployment-of-vaccines-insurrection-act.html</a>  </p>
<p><em>"'Operation Warp Speed' isn't actually about vaccines. It's a       cover story to distribute US military troops across America under       the cover of 'vaccine distribution.' This is why Trump is pushing       so aggressively for a vaccine by November 1st. He needs troops       ready to activate before Election Day. Once the radical Left       launches riots and violence after the election, Trump invokes the       Insurrection Act and activates all the troops already in place."</em>  </p>
<p><em>"In other words ... “Operation Warp Speed” isn’t really a vaccine       operation but rather a national security operation that will put       US troops on the streets of every American city in an effort to       restore the rule of law, arrest treasonous actors (including       mayors and governors) and put down left-wing terrorists."</em></p>
