        <p>Former newspaper reporter here,</p>
<p>Those dingbats in the financial sections are worthless. It's quite literally "markets moving this way because... (whatever the headline is for the day)"</p>
<p>They just need to fill space. That's it.</p>

        <p>It's not fake dude. </p>
<p>The fed has to balance between hyper-liquidity and illiquidity. There's too much cash in the system. </p>
<p>Hyper-liquidity - to combat that, the fed is forced to keep the money printing. This becomes a singular point of Weimar Republic Germany, hyper inflation, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, etc. There's too much overleveraged positions, and this is one road they can continue down. </p>
<p>Illiquidity - stop the printer. The dollar will stabilize, but the veil is pulled back with EVERYONE caught with their dick in their hands.  The result, is skyrocketing interest rates, which will cause a collapse on commercial mortgage backed securities, people have too much credit and will be forced into bankruptcy and foreclosure. </p>
<p>The FED HAS to choose a path. </p>
<p>It looks like they're leaning towards creating an illiquid market so far.  Stocks are falling because institutions are overleveraged. Selloffs and value will decrease. Stocks will plummet as the market constricts and dries up. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo came out today and canceled all their credit lines for their customers. You don't do that, unless youre overleveraged and bleeding. </p>
<p>You've been warned. This isn't about Covid. Never has been.</p>

        <p>I've posted this before. </p>
<p>Wallstreet is tumbling because the bankers are losing control of the world economy. Due to tremendous amounts of greed and overleveraged positions.</p>
<p>ALL of Covid and the vaccine is a massive distraction to the true problem that is on the precipice of bubbling over.  The economic collapse. </p>
<p>Keeping us scared of Covid is a complete distraction. </p>
<p>In the United States you're going to see an economic collapse worse than 1929. People will be angry. Very angry. They will revolt against the elites, who ripped their freedom, closed their businesses, and indoctrinated them with a "vaccine" that is killing youth and compromising the healthy.  The American people are fed up, and the elites know this. </p>
<p>This is VERY fucking close to happening, and when it does. You'll know, and Covid will be a drop in the ocean for what is to come. </p>
<p>Kiss your loved ones, and join hands with your fellow countrymen. Fuck BLM, Woke, Trans Rights, Women's rights. It's all distracted in-fighting so that we don't wake up to those greedy hogs at the top. </p>
<p>Haha went on a bit of a rant, but this comment is going to age very well. I'm not wrong.</p>
