    <strong>Don't get yourselves distracted by the squeaky toy (Fauci)</strong>
    <p><p>Over the past few days I've seen quite a few posts flaring up about Fauci and his emails, how he knew it all along etc.    </p>
<p>That's fine, it's true, the evidence is there.    </p>
<p>This is however a distraction. Fauci is nothing but a scapegoat. The people who are really responsible for this are putting everyone they can in the direction of the shots.     </p>
<p>Don't let those who are really responsible for the biggest genocide in history of this planet get away with it.     </p>
<p>Jump in on the class action lawsuits that are going on against CEOs of Pfizer, Moderna etc, focus on the journalists who promote the hate and measures taken by the government, get every fucking one of them down if you can.     </p>
<p>If it was for me, those companies would be shut down, their assets seized and handed out to businesses that went bankrupt or close to it because of this bs.    </p>
<p>On top of that I personally would have the heads of the vaccine developers and others responsible on the block and gone with them for genocide though usually I'm not a supporter or promoter of death sentences.</p></p>

        <p>There's a reason why there hasn't been, and almost certainly never will be, a real investigation of the Wuhan lab. And it's not because of China's involvement in creating COVID.</p>
<p>It's because of Pfizer's, Moderna's, Johnson and Johnson's and AstraZeneca's involvement in creating COVID.</p>

        <p>Precisely. Genocide is not protected through liability clauses though so they can and hopefully will be prosecuted.</p>

        <p>I also feel the same. Everything about the whole Faucigate seems off. Like, all government employees are subject to FOIA, so it's not like he would <em>not</em> have known what he writes or says could have been incriminating. Something is off about this whole debacle. Patsies like him and Gates are just the frontmen/posterboys, not the real schemers behind this whole farce.</p>

        <p>I agree this is a diversion, but I'm not clear why...</p>
<p>To maintain the illusion that covid is real?</p>
<p>To shift us on to stage 2 (financial crash / supply chain disruption) which would need to involve China?</p>

        <p>The people at the pharma companies have worked hard to sell their new poison and made sure that we're left without the possibility of attacking them legally for causing people harm with it.     </p>
<p>Fauci is only the ugly face of the campaign, as well as a few others, who will be charged and sentenced, leaving those who should really pay, out of the picture, or so they think.     </p>
<p>I don't know anything about a stage 2 and tbh China's involvement may be less than we think. It's self-evident how much easier it is for a corrupt, totalitarian government to control the dumb masses with help of a few of the biggest global players, leaving them richer and us poorer.</p>

        <p>To join a class action lawsuit, you need to first take the vaccine and get harmed or at least have a family member who was harmed and cannot join (such as due to death or because they are a minor), but even then, they are pretty well shielded, especially in the US where they have been exempt from liability for decades.</p>
