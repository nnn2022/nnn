    <strong>Fear + Propaganda = Sheep</strong>
    <p><p>Masks are now optional at my workplace. Aside from myself, some maintenance guys and our IT person and his crew, everyone still wear them all the time. They are saying: </p>
<ol>
<li>I'm scared without a mask.</li>
<li>I don't want to make other people feel uncomfortable (wha???)</li>
<li>"Feeling frightened."</li>
<li>What if I have to work with an un-vaccinated person? (Again, huh?  We have worked through this whole pandemic. Get a different job if this is the case).</li>
<li>I'm so very filled with fear.</li>
<li>I like the masks, they keep me anonymous. (why do you have a public job?)</li>
<li>"This  is just a dry-run because I'm going to wear my mask all the time in  public and for the rest of my life because, you know,  humans--germs--sickness--living."</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll  straight up say that I see all of these people differently now.  It has  really exposed how utterly cowardly and timid so many people have become, especially in the education, public service sector that I work at. The government, and most specifically Fauci, created a servile and robotic portion of the population. It feels much like the pod people from the Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</p></p>
