    <strong>The burden of proof</strong>
    <p><p>is on the person trying to convince you to get vaxxed. Prove to me that if I take it, I wont get the virus, I wont get sick, and I wont spread it. Furthermore, prove to me that the spike protein is not cytotoxic, and is not bio distributed, only concentrated in my arm. In other words prove to me that its a Vaccine.</p></p>

        <p>I've seen things about saying how governments and pfizer have an agreement not to disclose any adverse effects for about 10 years so that alone should be enough to refuse such a concoction being injected in your body</p>

        <p>Wait, are you implying burden of proof lies on who makes the claim? You must be new to these parts!</p>
<p>I fully agree with you, but it'll never happen. Branch Covidians are not allowed to question, they just mindlessly do what the television and Twitter demand of them.</p>

        <p>Yes. In my opinion, one of the most powerful questions to ask people about the mRNA shots that will get a good conversation going and promote critical thinking is: ask if they know of any peer-reviewed independent research studies that try to determine where the nanoparticles holding the mRNA get distributed once injected in the body and what variables might affect the outcome. Any time anyone tells you something about the mRNA shots, gently ask about the methodology used to determine that finding. Ask for specific methodology, data collected, and results of specific studies, not just "sources" which can be anything. Look for and read studies. Combat scientific illiteracy by reading, critiquing, and sharing actual journal articles. Do not believe people who think only specialists can understand the articles. That's not true. Use libraries, not google, to search for journal articles. If you run into a paywall to access an article, please dm me and I will get it for free.</p>

        <p>You mean liposomes? Into the cell membrane like all liposomes. Go find those studies yourself though lol, it pretty basic stuff. Heres one though, was not hard to find.  https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.1c04996</p>

        <p>That's right. Maybe I didn't phrase my question well. I am wondering about where the mRNA gets distributed in the body. Does all the mRNA go into the arm muscle cells or does it go somewhere else?</p>

<p>As i comend this all 'learn for yourself, don't trust tv' stuff, taking medical decisions for yourself without medical knowledge (basic tbh, this is 2nd year stuff) or trusted doctor opinion is most of the time pretty risky stuff.</p>

        <p>Its funny, another question that I asked, after the initial question. Why do I have to do all the hard work? Reading these studies, learning more about biology, spike proteins, how vaccines should work, how they function. My arguments stem from quoting the CDC, the Pfizer studies, nefarious or not, while they get to just repeat what some guy said on TV!!</p>

        <p>Biology in general doesn't work like that due to too many factors and difference among people. In order to actually prove it, either you need a ridiculously powerful computer where you can just feed every factor and calculate the consequence or a few clones of yours to actually test.</p>

        <p>Not that I care if you take it or not it’s a free will choice, vaccines aren’t a cure. They never have been, that’s why it’s called a vaccine. The flu shot, measles shot, polio shot all prevent these diseases, they do not cure them. The definition of vaccine is literally “a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide immunity against one or several diseases, prepared from the causative agent of a disease, its products, or a synthetic substitute, treated to act as an antigen without inducing the disease”. I don’t understand how people who are completely opposed to it are so adamant about “the facts of the vaccine” when they don’t even know the difference between a vaccine and a cure.</p>

        <p>I’d like to offer emotional allegiance to myself. When I think about getting he vaccine it doesn’t feel like a good choice for me. And my emotions are valid to me. The End. I’m not debating it (I mean I will on Reddit). And I know that sounds cowardly but it’s just to exhausting debating with people. Specially if they already got it. They can’t see what they don’t want too. And people don’t want to be wrong and have to grieve the fact that they where duped. It’s really the Ego. And I don’t want my Ego to get into the same wave link as them. I want to walk away and just carry on with my life. They want us to fight ya’ll. They want us to argue and turn against one another. Perhaps we should just walk away.</p>
