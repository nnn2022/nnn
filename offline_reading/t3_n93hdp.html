        <p><strong>Last week</strong> news broke in <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/chinese-military-scientists-discussed-weaponising-sars-coronaviruses/news-story/850ae2d2e2681549cb9d21162c52d4c0">The Australian</a> that Chinese scientists were weaponizing coronavirus for five years before the outbreak last year in Wuhan, China. </p>
<p>Report:  Chinese Military Discussed Weaponizing Coronavirus Five Years Ago  before Outbreak — While Dr. Fauci Was Funding Their Wuhan Facilities</p>
<p><strong>Back in September 2020,</strong> Col. Lawrence Sellin (ret.) reported that there is unequivocal evidence the Chinese military was involved in the creation of the Chinese coronavirus.</p>
<p>Dr. Li-Meng Yan, who investigated the origin of the COVID-19 virus  during the initial outbreak in Wuhan China as a medical researcher in  Hong Kong, has now provided unequivocal evidence that the virus was not of natural origin.</p>
<p>In the article, “Unusual Features of the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Suggesting  Sophisticated Laboratory Modification Rather Than Natural Evolution and Delineation of Its Probable Synthetic Route,” Dr. Yan and her  colleagues have offered a detailed description of how the virus was  synthesized in laboratories controlled by China’s military.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tony Fauci was funding the Wuhan testing facilities during this time.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/china-probed-weaponising-coronavirus-in-2015-reports/cid/1815074">The Telegraph India</a> reported:</p>
<p>&rt;<em>Chinese scientists allegedly investigated weaponising coronaviruses  five years before the Covid-19 pandemic and may have predicted a World  War III fought with biological weapons, according to media reports  referring to documents obtained by the US State Department.</em>  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;<em>According to The Sun newspaper in the UK, quoting reports first released by</em> <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/chinese-military-scientists-discussed-weaponising-sars-coronaviruses/news-story/850ae2d2e2681549cb9d21162c52d4c0"><em>The Australian</em></a><em>,  the bombshell documents obtained by the US State Department reportedly  show the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) commanders making the  sinister prediction.</em></p>
