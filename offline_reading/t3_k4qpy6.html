        <p>I agree that this is tyranny. We have people who are quite literally starving to death. If it wasn't for my parents estate, I would personally be starving to death right now because I cannot hold a job with my mental illness and Social Services keeps on telling me "You are not mentally ill enough to be on SSI or SSDI!"</p>

        <p>My girlfriend's shop got shut down from March-June. She had two jobs and her second job shut down too. She filed for unemployment but never saw a dime. She had NO money coming in, but thankfully, I'm active duty, and was still getting paid. She moved in with me until her job started up again. </p>
<p>I'm lucky. I'm the exception. Many lost EVERYTHING. And the going narrative in the media is that if you didn't die of COVID this year, you didn't die. </p>
<p>I don't think we'll ever know how many starved or committed suicide.</p>

<p>And the media is not covering the mass unemployment and homelessness that will happen. Theyre just waiting for Biden </p>

<p>We will never know because the people behind the stats will actively try to hide it.</p>

        <p>IMO it stops being tyranny when it gets to that point and starts being an engineered genocide.</p>
<p>I believe part of the reason for these lockdowns are to cause a mass starvation event to kill off a large proportion of people, or maybe it's to get people desperate to accept anything that the government offers as help, even though they're responsible for the mass starvations.</p>
