    <strong>Covid - Distraction of the Year</strong>
    <p><p>The year is 2020.</p>
<p>It came as a shock when the US elected their first black President in 2012. Now, the president of the 'free world' is a washed-up former billionaire never fully removed from the golden teat of being born into so-called privilege. After running his daddy's company into the ground, he became a washed-up game show reality TV star and continued to lose money and evade the IRS. Now, in the ultimate position of power, the ego-maniacal, sexist, Pig-headed disrespectful tyrant thinks that he can do whatever he wants. Even now, as he is set to leave office, he is still ranting and raving like a toddler on a tantrum every time he doesn't get his way, screaming "You're Fired!" at whoever upsets him. He doesn't give a shit about his nation, his people.</p>
<p>Only himself.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's sad how many stupid people there are in America because only they would vote for him. Case in point, I was watching Animal Cops and some stupid guy thought he could keep an alligator in the house as a pet...There were TRUMP signs everywhere.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It has been nearly an entire YEAR that this fear-mongering via propaganda has gone on......That's right, we have wasted nearly an entire year of our lives. Most of that year spent trapped inside, our eyes glued to televisions and social media, waiting on instruction on what to do next..that things are going to get better. </p>
<p>Wait... I know a song to this effect that goes "Don't want to be an American Idiot...one nation controlled by the media / controlled by hysteria... It's calling out to Idiot America!"</p>
<p>In March, Covid-19 hit and the world went into a lockdown...</p>
<p>People started dying and hospitals and morgues are overwhelmed with the number of bodies that are piling up. Front line staff are overwhelmed, overworked, and can't deal mentally and emotionally. The government says they are just as flabbergasted and overwhelmed at this as the public and do not have any answers for us on how this started or what they are now going to do about it. They tell us to stay tuned to tv and social media for further instructions and go silent for a while. </p>
<p>We are told to stay locked down, given rules and guidelines...this goes on for a while then it changes, things are lifted and we can see smiling faces again and talk but social distance.</p>
<p>Summer comes to an end and we are on lockdown again as cold and flu season approaches.. Well .. DUH! it's going to spread, the symptoms for COVID are the SAME as the flu! Did I forget to mention that? Yeah, fever, chills, diarrhea, vomiting. It's a virus that has to run its course, like any other virus out there that causes the flu. Yet...there is still no definite end to this so-called 'pandemic'.</p>
<p>Do you see where I'm going with this?</p>
<p>I mean, c'mon there has to be an alternate agenda here! How could there NOT be, allowing all these people to die while blaming it all on the flu, although it may have been from underlying medical conditions.. yet apparently the rich and privileged get sick and are well again within a week? </p>
<p>I also hope that whoever's behind this has a plan to drag tRump out of office and off to jail for coercion, treason, tax fraud, and anything else that will keep his disheveled, unkempt, rude, entitled ass in prison for the rest of his life. </p>
<p>Besides that, what else is the government doing behind our backs? Denying abortion rights? Running bills through that will slowly take away women's rights that we have fought so hard to earn, despite still not being treated as equals?</p>
<p>Running drugs/money across the world for their own benefit or to appease some government somewhere in the far east? </p>
<p>Spending sloppily at the taxpayer's expense? Most definitely!! Especially when there are people at home, wherever that is to you, dear reader; who are starving and without adequate shelter, food on the table, and clothes on their backs. Where people are afraid to leave an abusive relationship because they are afraid of their abuser. Many of these people have no other place to go, as they have been isolated from friends and family. </p>
<p>War Veterans who are suffering from PTSD and substance abuse. Living on the streets and begging for change, despite being war HERO'S who have stood up for their country and the right to live free. They should be treated a lot better than that! </p>
<p>How society's most vulnerable are treated really shows how corrupt those in power really are.</p></p>

        <p>It’s a bot post. Nothing to see here. If this were an intelligent, non-biased post, the OP would have mentioned that government leaders at all levels opposed the president on his travel restrictions in February. They called him racist and xenophobic and encouraged people to visit Chinatown in CA and NY. To continue shopping and live their lives. That was until The masses started buying into the plague mentality and they saw money to be made. Then they were all about masks, Trump didn’t do enough, and travel bans and lockdowns became their ideas. It’s a farce and a joke and being being perpetrated on the public as real.</p>

<p>The point of the post is to show that people are Sheeple and will idolize someone in power instead of rising up to question them when necessary. How was donald trump ever able to run for president, let alone be elected? Being famous before his failed presidency led people to idolize him and follow him like sheep. Granted these people are stupid and now look at the states along with the rest of the world.</p>

        <p>I spent none of the year, inside, glued to social media. That is what people who can’t think for themselves do. I don’t need instructions to tell me what to do. I lived my life the best I could given the hysteria. Sure I couldn’t go to the movies, but fuck Hollywood, I don’t like to give them my money anyway. I lost my job, but rather than waiting for the government to save me like a deadbeat, I took whatever job I could, multiple in fact, to make equal to what I made before. I still got married, with all of my invited guests, traveled to Disney for my Honeymoon (No lines!) I agree with you, fuck the government, it’s not just Trump, it’s been like this for a while. It’s time for a Revolution of sorts. It doesn’t have to be violent, but those in power won’t go without a fight. You think Biden is going to be non-corrupt? He’s been part of the same corrupt system for 50 years lol. It doesn’t get better until we decide it does. I think that the Covid bullshit will backfire on them because people will be pushed to their limit and that’s when governments get overthrown.</p>

<p>This may come as a massive shock, but not compelling others to fund your lifestyle choices is not 'denying your rights.' You don't have a right to anyone's approval or cash.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying MY rights in particular, but Women's rights to medical procedures involving the reproductive system, including abortion should not be so hard to receive, no matter where you live. <br>
What kind of lifestyle do you think these women live? Walk a mile in their shoes, poor and unable to support themselves and they find out their pregnant. Or maybe they were raped? Maybe they just don't want to bring children into the world at that time, given current circumstances???   </p>
<p>Or maybe, they don't want to bring a child into the world at all?  I fit into this category. Finally had my hysterectomy just over a year ago after fighting for 10+ YEARS of awful pain from cysts on my ovaries that would cause me to pass out. But not before passing out and splitting my head open which required eight stitches to close. I also had a concussion which lasted a week.</p>

<p>One of these is not like the others.</p>
<p>Either way, no-one's 'right' grows out of another's forcibly-extracted wallet. I think people should be much more generous with their money, and single or poor mothers should be supported. Perhaps by the state. Perhaps by charity. But not by theft.</p>
