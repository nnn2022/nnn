    <strong>Allegiant Airlines kicks off Trump supporter</strong>
    <p><p>My husband, grandson and I were on an Allegiant flight from Great Falls to Arizona.</p>
<p>We were asked to get off the flight for not wearing masks.</p>
<p>This is our story:</p>
<p>We get to the waiting area and the gal calling out zones announces that “if you have a medical condition you do not have to wear a mask”. I suggest to my husband who is a veteran that he lets them know about his medical condition, so he doesn’t have to wear a mask.</p>
<p>He doesn’t say anything to the gal but walks past the gate not wearing a mask. I assume they can’t ask about his medical condition because of HIPAA. I have seen this on store signs.</p>
<p>We board the flight and I mention to a stewardess that he has a medical condition, so I ask if he has to wear a mask. She lets me know that they need a note from a doctor for that exception.</p>
<p>My husband and I both suffer from lung tumors so masks are especially bothersome, but we still wore them yesterday!</p>
<p>When I am asking the stewardess if my husband is exempt, my own Trump 2020 mask dropped a bit so I could talk. She demands I tighten it up and I did.</p>
<p>We go to our seats and my husband has on a tight medical mask given to him by a stewardess. He never removes it the whole time we are seated except to eat a piece of candy.</p>
<p><strong>We are all wearing masks.</strong> We sit on the tarmac for 50 minutes. I am drinking water, so my mask is pulled down and up and my grandson is eating Lemon Head candies so his mask also is up and down, but still looped around our ears.</p>
<p>On a recent Alaska Airlines flight I was advised that I do not have to wear a mask while eating or drinking.</p>
<p><strong>A stewardess does come by when my mask is up and tells me I need another mask on top of my Trump 2020 mask because mine does does not go over my ears. I show her the ear loops on my Trump 2020 mask. She leaves; defeated she couldn’t cover my Trump 2020 mask.</strong></p>
<p>No one says another word as we are waiting for maintenance then we get an announcement we are turning around to the gate because of a mask violation. We have no idea it is us!</p>
<p>We go back to gate and three of your representatives tell us we have to get off the plane because we won’t wear masks. I tell them we are eating and drinking. They won’t hear anything of it and tell us we don’t have any choice and they escort us off the flight.</p>
<p>So we get off the plane with a crying grandson who wanted to go to Arizona with his grandparents.</p>

<p>Found your real reason right here. They booted you because of political afflilation. There are a lot of people who hate trump supporters even people who merely voted for trump.</p>
<p>And this goes against American values that I know of for so long.</p>
<p>Problem is political afflilation discrimination is legal in the US so the only ground to sue is on 1st amendment rights.</p>

        <p>If you want to be a victim, you’ll be a victim.</p>
<p>The Trump branding had nothing to do with why they were removed. They were violating this airlines policies. Just because an Alaskan Airlines flight allowed them to take masks off during eating and drinking doesn’t mean that this airline has the same polices. </p>
<p>&rt;    Face coverings may be briefly removed to eat or drink, but otherwise must be worn at all times including at the ticket counter and gate, while boarding and exiting the plane, and on board the aircraft.</p>
<p>Something tells me that these face coverings weren’t briefly removed. I’m absolutely not pro-mask but the Trump logo isn’t why they were removed.</p>

        <p>You're right: not <strong>briefly</strong> removed - the masks <strong>weren't removed at all</strong>. They remained on faces, just moved up or down to eat or drink.</p>

        <p>Find a good civil rights lawyer (hopefully who may take the case pro bono), and sue the pants off of them.</p>
<p>You followed the instructions you were given, the stewardess made it obvious the issue was the Trump mask, and medical confidentiality rules still apply ie they can't ask for a doctor's note.</p>
<p>Do you have any witnesses willing to come forward on your behalf?</p>

        <p>If the airlines receive a government bailout, I will lose my shit.</p>
<p>Service levels and behaviour by airline staff prior to the FakeDemic were abysmal - they are now into "Auschwitz of the Air" levels of terrible - and they are accountable to no one.</p>

        <p>I think something odd is behind the flight industry. They really don’t seem bothered even though their business has got to be the most affected.. Travel will also be the thing that stays restricted longer than anything else. Yet they aren’t doing much to make their customers happy. It’s as if they don’t care and want to go back to the 60s when flying was a luxury and mostly just for the upper class.</p>

        <p>I'm sure it has something to do with being a Trump supporter, but some people think disliking masks or not believing in their efficacy is the same thing as not wearing one (even if you are). So by asking for an exemption, you become a "filthy unmasked person" for all intents and purposes even if you agree to wear one.</p>

        <p>I’ve flown AA, Alaska and United... but the only airline that gave me grief about masks (and also temperature checked me at the gate — barf!) was Frontier. A rinky dink budget carrier like Allegiant.</p>
