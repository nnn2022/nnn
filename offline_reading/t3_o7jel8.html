    <strong>Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.</strong>
    <p><p>By Benjamin Franklin. Exactly what is happening today. Doomer accepted to give up their libertied and accepted lockdowns and forced vaccination to be “safe”. Remember the “stay safe” that’s used everywhere.</p>
<p>1.5y later, lockdowns and forced vaccinations are still here + we are not safe  with vaccinated people getting infected as much as unvaccinated and people dying from the vaccine.</p>
<p>You are being played by the global elite who are exempt of lockdowns and other restrictions that apply only for slaves like you</p></p>
