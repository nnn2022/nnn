        <p>The logic of these people. "She would've died soon anyway", is an argument used by them, yet you can say the exact fucking thing for every 89 year old who dies from COVID, but suddenly when it's gRaNdMa, no death is acceptable.</p>

        <p>They are shallow, worthless, under educated, over socialized, pieces of trash. They are the epitome of moral-relativism. They act like they are some virtuous intellectuals when in reality they are just afraid they might get it and so “insert mental gymnastics here.” They can’t catch cancer or mental illness or poverty so they DO NOT CARE, but the minute they might be exposed to a COLD VIRUS that is a little worse than usual, “Screw you, science denier, this is for the good of humanity!”</p>

        <p>And if they try to tell you that you are because of muh public health and you say “okay, if I’m responsible for your health, I order you to go on a diet, lose weight, stop watching tv, go to bed at 8pm, disclose to me any prescription medications and previous sexual partners, vigorous exercise 1 hr everyday and no more smoking, drinking, or sweets of any kind,” well, they don’t seem to like that very much.</p>

        <p>Yes pretty much this. </p>
<p>What also annoys me, is the "don't you care about obese people" bullshit. Honestly, even if you're overweight, you're still not in a high risk group. You have to have an BMI around 40, to be among the risk groups and sorry, if you didn't bother looking after yourself the last years, I don't see why I should. </p>
<p>I've seen so many doomers crying about how "people don't care about my health because I'm morbidly obese :(". It's funny how NOW they could do something against it, but instead they opt out to stuff their faces even more.</p>

<p>Truth is I don’t. I don’t care about anorexic people either. I might pay them the passing thought of hoping they get better and can overcome whatever is causing their eating disorder. But beyond that I really don’t care. I don’t keep them in the forefront of my mind throughout the day. I don’t invest extra time in doing anything special for them. I certainly don’t sacrifice hard-earned and well-liked things in my life, that make my life worth living, for them. And I never claimed to be someone who did! And the people who are upset about it aren’t doing those things either! Since when did not “caring” enough become this hypocritical thought crime?</p>

        <p>Right.  We are forced to care about everyone that has a problem?  Why do i have to care about this group or that?  It's getting tiring keeping track of all the poor oppressed people I need to care about.  I care about myself so I can try to care about the people in my life. It's always an argument too.  I got into an argument with a trans person on Reddit who said something like you don't even care about Trans people as if that voided my argument.  Why do I have to care about Trans people?  Trans people aren't forced to care about me.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's only that, I think that they're very lonely and don't get invited to anything. Or why do you think, that they respond with such vitriol when they see a party? </p>
<p>Someone I know is also someone who cares about COVID, and who wears a mask, etc, but even he doesn't really care about people having parties, he just doesn't go there. Doomers could do the same, but instead they sneak out and secretly film these people (prior to this, reddit would've lost its shit because of that) and then cry in their virtual hugbox.</p>

        <p>The only part I disagree with is the “under educated” part. I fear it’s the complete opposite: many have at minimum bachelor degrees and have gone through the academic conditioning and indoctrination. People who <em>think</em> they’re smart are more susceptible to propaganda and brainwashing because they believe they’re too smart to be fooled.</p>
<p>So you have a mixture of conditioning to follow authority unquestioningly as a result of schooling and an inflated ego. It’s radicalized dumbassery basically lol they’re useful idiots who will never question their assumptions due to their level of education and the echo chambers in which they operate daily.</p>

        <p>The woman was in her early 30's. Most COVID-19 deaths are above the average life expectancy. If we assume the average COVID-19 death is one year below life expectancy then her death alone is worth 40 COVID deaths. </p>
<p>But deaths from cancer don't matter I suppose, only COVID-19 deaths get the red carpet..</p>

        <p>&rt;    it’s a cost-benefit analysis</p>
<p>That’s the most frustrating thing, is that <strong>no</strong>, there was absolutely, without a doubt, zero cost-benefit consideration for any of this. These ignorant, blind, assholes <em>assume</em> there was some cost-benefit consideration “because of course, why wouldn’t there be,” because they trust that if they made this decision themselves, they would have done one. But no! There is not a shred of evidence that the consequences of lockdown (outside of the first two weeks) were ever considered before they were implemented and continued for the better part of a year. To think that and to believe that shut down cancer treatments for <em>months</em> was considered at the start of all this, and taken as acceptable, is to be willfully stupid.</p>

        <p>Fun fact: most redditors, especially in r/Immunology are scientists or future scientists ;). Talk about a circlejerk subreddit. Taking your time to make separate posts to bash someone together who disagrees with you. High quality sub I must say</p>

        <p>Are you yourself an immunologist? If so, please do your best in dispeling the myths that immunity doesn't last very long since antibodies fade. We've had enough medical misinformation in the past 8 months as it is, specifically early in the pandemic when doctors and immunologists were saying there is no immunity.</p>

        <p>Well, I'm studying to become a tumor immunologist, so kind of.</p>
<p>&rt; immunity doesn't last very long since antibodies fade. </p>
<p>Given that you're talking about COVID-19, two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Antibodies are not the only mechanism in your body to get rid of infected cells. Cytotoxic T cells' role seems to be crucial as well, which are also activated (same as for memory T cells for immunity) when encountering the viral antigens. However, studying these cytotoxic T cells on a large scale is much harder as they are present in much lower quantities compared to antibodies.</li>
<li>We need more time before we can draw a conclusion about fading away of antibodies. I've seen several contradicting studies (which of course is normal), so there's nothing we can say really.</li>
</ol>
<p>Luckily, a vaccine can strengthen the immunity by using adjuvants in the vaccine design, so for vaccines the case is a bit different.</p>

        <p>No, I know these things man. I'm a med student and like 2 days before the lockdowns happened in March I finished my immunology rotation.</p>
<p>I can imagine how difficult and expensive it would be to replicate the Karolinska Institute study on a larger, populational level so that'll probably be years away.</p>
<p>As for the second point, I explain it to people as antibodies fading after an immune response is a normal thing. Antibodies are produced by Plasma cells derived from clonal expansion of B cells, but Plasma cells don't replicate. Their only job is to make immunoglobulins. They die off after a certain period, but a small subset of Memory B cells remain.</p>
<p>The point of my comment was the general public around you. Your non-medically educated friends and family. I think it is up to us to be the filter between total bullshit and current established science for them, because there are too many fearmongering articles coming out on such things.</p>
<p>&rt;Well, I'm studying to become a tumor immunologist, so kind of.</p>
<p>Good luck! I'm planning on specializing in either cardiology or oncology myself in the future.</p>

        <p>Ah you're a med student as well.</p>
<p>&rt;I think it is up to us to be the filter between total bullshit and current established science for them, because there are too many fearmongering articles coming out on such things.</p>
<p>Yes, I totally agree with you. Indeed I've seen some fearmongering articles as well as hyping up drugs before they've even started clinical trials. But I've seen too much downplaying of the severity as well. Take OP for example. He's cherry-picking studies/articles to support his standpoint, but people need to understand that that is not how it works. If I cherry-pick studies, I can 'prove' almost anything in science.</p>
<p>I'm not having any trouble updating my friends and family. However, people on the internet seem to be much more stubborn, so I've kind of given up. There seems to be a lack of knowledge on how science works in general, that makes it impossible to have a proper disscussion with these people.</p>
<p>&rt;Good luck! I'm planning on specializing in either cardiology or oncology myself in the future.</p>
<p>Thank you, I wish you best of luck too!</p>
