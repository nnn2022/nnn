        <p>Easy for these elites to say closing down businesses, staying home like a fucking hermit, and losing your life savings is righteous when they have many many millions to live off of and they get exemptions to the rules that us plebs don't get.  Fuck these arrogent ignorant assholes.</p>

        <p>The cancer argument is deceptive and exaggerated. People get second or third opinions in the medical field all the time. </p>
<p>But the reason myself and others distrust Fauci is because Covid mitigation measures do not happen in a vacuum. They have side effects in other areas. We may never know the true number of people who have committed suicide or overdosed as a consequence of pandemic related unemployment, depression, misery, etc. </p>
<p>What was good about the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic is that they didn’t solely listen to the scientists. They took the input of economists and others to determine that a federal lockdown/mask mandate wouldn’t make sense. The Covid situation in South Dakota is different than New York, so it wouldn’t make sense to implement the same measures in both places.</p>

        <p>Too many people are falling for this false logic.</p>
<p>"These are the experts.  We should listen to them".</p>
<p>First of all, not all the experts agree.</p>
<p>Second of all, science is an empirical study.  It does not make decisions.</p>
<p>The science so far has <em>only</em> focused on transmission of covid-19.  Nothing else.  Not the economic impact, not the impact on future taxation, not the impact on the social fabric.</p>
<p>I don't know about you guys, but I'll say this about myself.  I used to be an upstanding, hard-working, contributing member of society.  I had employees, I delivered an important service to my clients, and I helped other small businesses with my purchases of their products.</p>
<p>This has all been completely wiped out to zero due to the government imposed lockdowns.</p>
<p>I will say this: The government will not be getting any more money out of me.  I will not be paying my taxes going forward.  Nor will I make any attempt to prop up a government which either through malice or incompetence (or both) ruined everything I built over the past 15 years.</p>
<p>I have a feeling many people feel the same way.</p>
<p>If you've read Atlas Shrugged you'll be familiar with the phrase "Who Is John Galt?".  "Where have all the good, productive people of society gone?"</p>
<p>Well, they disappeared.  Government created an environment where innovation and hard work no longer mean anything.  Therefore, those individuals stopped producing.</p>
<p>Watch how quickly our society falls apart after that.</p>

        <p>There are thousands of experts from different countries who have signed various open letters against lockdowns, aside from the GBD.</p>
<p>And lots of experts criticizing PCR testing.</p>
<p>And now equally many experts skeptical of a rushed new form of vaccine.</p>

        <p>Has Fauci said anything as of yet about Ivermectin?</p>
<p>After banning this drug for use in covid (with 40 years of safety data) the NIH quietly became neutral on it last week. 16 RCTs on Ivermectins use in covid - prophylactic and treatment in early and critical stage illness. https://covid19criticalcare.com/</p>
<p>Just because someone is an expert doesn't mean they'll do the right thing.  </p>
<p><strong><em> Reminder of Lancetgate </em></strong> a sham of study (since retracted) passed and was published in the leading most prestigious medical journal. </p>
<p>Ps it would have inspired more confidence if Fauci had said "while we wait for the vaccine, please ensure your vitamin  D levels are sufficient"</p>

        <p>Guess that's why I went to two doctors and a chiropractor about my chronic neck pain and only found relief when I did my own research. Spoiler alert: It was bad posture. Was holding my shoulders up unintentionally. I haven't had pain since reading an online article. Huh🤷🏻‍♀️</p>
<p>Just remembered I had a similar experience with odd abdominal and back pain I was having. Saw three OB/GYN's and got treated like I was making it all up. Online research alerted me to peri menopause and some herbals that might help. Spoiler alert: The herbals helped immensely. They also helped with another issue my doctor wanted to give me prescription meds for.</p>

        <p>There's a lot of fallacies in his reasoning.</p>
<p>Building muscles and a good body is a reasonably objective hard result. It is also not particularly complicated.</p>
<p>Balancing the pros and cons of approaches to handle a pandemic is not something anyone is an expert in; some people know more than others about specific areas but that doesn't mean that those people know more than the collective wisdom of the others, the so-called "non-experts". There's no way this is true...the collective wisdom of non-experts, as well as dissenting so-called experts will always vastly outweigh the knowledge of one individual come-what may. </p>
<p>The prevalence of groupthink amongst associated groups is also a huge problem and always leads to conformity. If you hear the phrase "there's a consensus of experts" on complicated issues, that is far more indicative of groupthink than it is of a lot of independent people coming to the same conclusions from their own independent experiments.</p>
<p>There's also the usual trope - follow the money. If you want to know why an "expert" thinks something, it's usually a good idea to check who's paying his salary. It's quite an eye opener to understand that expert opinion almost always conforms to the opinion that happens to make him wealthier.</p>
