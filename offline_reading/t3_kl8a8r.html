    <strong>How are car dealerships now?</strong>
    <p><p>I don't mean the sales side, though that may be relevant.  How crazy are parts departments with masks?  I need to purchase some parts from my local dealership.  Being Sunday, I couldn't call them since they're closed so I decided to check out their website.  Amazingly, covid isn't even mentioned once on the site.  Surely that must be an oversight so I looked at their Twitter.  Basically nothing either.  It's filled with people posing with their new cars.  About half of the pictures are people without masks inside so I'm conflicted.  </p>
<p>Basically, can I expect my local parts department to be mask Nazis?  Has anyone had a shitty experience with this?</p></p>

        <p>I think it depends where you are...
Here in Central P.A., I can walk into most stores - including Walmart, Lowes, McDonalds, big name food stores - with no mask, shop with no mask, check-out with no mask and it's no big deal, I don't even get any second glances.</p>

        <p>Most big stores here (Texas) are like that too. I haven't been to the dealership in a while, so I have no frame of reference. The website being generic doesn't help either. I may have to just go when I get some free time, even though it's a haul.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™d recommend the same approach anywhere, walk in not wearing one and if they ask you to, wear it under your nose. That way you can judge for yourself what level of paranoia they are at.</p>

        <p>You could also get away  with not wearing one by saying you're exempt or just ignoring them unless they're really militant about it.</p>

        <p>I'm in bad California and my Honda dealership feels exactly the same as before, just with masks. Had an issue with my car and they asked me to ride shotgun with the 60+ year old master technician to help diagnose my issue. Windows rolled up, no AC running, all the things that go against the guidelines. I couldn't believe that they allowed that to happen in Gavin Newsom's state. We wore masks, I told him "I don't care if you don't care", he didn't care but he also didn't want to get in trouble over not wearing it. </p>
<p>I've never been to the parts counter before but I'd imagine it's going to be similar</p>

        <p>I usually go to O'Reily's and ACE to buy things for my E30. I have never worn a mask at these places and I have been fine. Some of the employees don't wear masks either. It's worth mentioning I live on the exurban/rural part of town and there's enough like-minded folks like us. The demographics of people who work with cars also plays a role here.</p>
<p>Try going without at first, see what happens. Worse case scenario you have to leave or have to wear it under your nose.</p>

        <p>I bought a car in July. I didn't wear a mask and they wanted my business so they didn't push it. Instead of doing a "test drive", I had to do a "car rental" because the dude wasn't allowed in the car with me.</p>
