    <strong>WANNA GO TO COLLEGE BUT DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANY VACCINATION PROOF.</strong>
    <p><p>My parents want me to go to college and get a good education more than anything. I value education too on a very high level. But I also value freedom and human rights and every university right now is requiring vaccination proof to have access to campus. I don't think it should matter whether I am vaccinated or not to have access to basic educational needs. These document requirements are plain stupidity and a violation of private life and I don't want to stand here and comply. I don't think that the vaccine is going to cause me any harm or refuse to get it, it's more of the fact that I am completely against having to provide proof of vaccination everywhere I go. </p>
<p>I just don't know what to do.</p></p>

        <p>Forget about going to university or college. They've essentially become leftist indoctrination / vaxxtermination centers. Besides the college degree is essentially worthless in this age of grade inflation, mass immigration, outsourcing and automation.</p>
<p>If you really want to experience the benefits of higher education, try distance learning or maybe try learning a trade instead?</p>

        <p>Agreed. I'm 41 and I have an associates degree from a community college, a state license for one trade, got on the job training for a second career and I'm currently getting online certified for a third career. </p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree that colleges are just leftist indoctrination centers at this point.</p>

        <p>I completely stand with you on this because a long time NYU professor Mark Crispin Miller was recently called to be fired by students for suggesting that mask mandates are propaganda... literally in an American propaganda class. He now fights for educational freedom and sued NYU for firing him. I do have the gross feeling that even being in college environment right now wouldn’t even allow for real educational discussions anymore because of censorship and the stigma around the unvaxxed. 
At this point I really do believe college isn’t what my parents make it out to be especially right now. But if I don’t go they probably would cut me off completely. So... I must.</p>

        <p>Ask your parents this question: if a university degree is so valuable, why is there so much student loan debt in this country?</p>
<p>The mere fact that this "crisis" exists is proof that the cost of attending a university is usually greater than the economic benefit of having the degree.</p>
<p>This might be hard for people from older generations to wrap their head around, because universities were truly worthwhile when they were your age. But it's not 1990 anymore. If they would cut you off for not attending a university, they're probably stuck in this mindset, so if you decide not to go to one you should try to show them why the calculus is different today.</p>

        <p>Attend an out of state community college and get an online degree. MCC Nebraska has good tuition and hasn’t asked for anything from me after I applied. I’m only taking one class there for post grad stuff but they said I didn’t need to send them anything, even transcripts.</p>

        <p>There are schools that don’t require the vaccine. Don’t listen to people telling you not to go- wtf kind of resistance is that? There shouldnt be any doctors, lawyers, or engineers who aren’t liberal? Liberty University and Univ of Alabama are just 2 off the top not requiring anything.</p>

        <p>I feel you, I'm kinda in the same boat rn. My community college mandated it last week. They're having everyone wear masks, which I simply won't do. Fuck that. For this semester I'm just gonna try to hold out by doing all online classes (which I don't mind, I enjoy online courses) and basically see what happens... But shit, I know that I can't stay online forever for certain classes like biology. I'm planning to protest with some friends because I'm not having any of this shit anymore</p>

        <p>If you have an idea of what you want to do for your career, find out if there's maybe a way you can get your foot in the door without a college degree. It really depends on the industry, but some options might include trade schools, online certifications, or apprenticeships.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that a lot of job listings will say that they require a bachelor's degree, but many companies won't really care as long as you can demonstrate you have the skills you need. And once you get that first entry-level job, a degree will become less and less important because you'll have real experience. Personally, i don't have a degree yet have landed multiple jobs that "required" one.</p>
<p>If you're not sure what you want to do, maybe go for an associate's degree. Community colleges are run more locally than universities so hopefully you can find one that doesn't mandate the vax.</p>
<p>Finally, you could look into private universities as well, as there are a few out there that are run by sane people.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>
