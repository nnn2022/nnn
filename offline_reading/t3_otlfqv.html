    <strong>Bob Odenkirk hospitalized after collapsing on set - could it be a long-term side effect?</strong>
    <p><p>Some of us are currently dealing with family members having long term side effects from an mRNA vaccine. When we see the following headlines we can't help but wonder...</p>
<p>March 27, 2021 : <strong>‘Better Call Saul’ stars get COVID vaccine at Hispanic Cultural Center</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.krqe.com/health/coronavirus/vaccine/better-call-saul-stars-get-covid-vaccine-at-hispanic-cultural-center/">https://www.krqe.com/health/coronavirus/vaccine/better-call-saul-stars-get-covid-vaccine-at-hispanic-cultural-center/</a></p>
<p>July 28, 2021 : <strong>Bob Odenkirk hospitalized after collapsing on set of 'Better Call Saul'</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/entertainment/bob-odenkirk-collapse-intl-scli/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/entertainment/bob-odenkirk-collapse-intl-scli/index.html</a></p>
<p>We all know about <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-57267169">Lisa Shaw's post-vaccine death</a> (BBC reporter)</p>
<p>And Vivekh, the India Health Minister who very famously got the vaccine <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/vivekh-59-popular-actor-and-green-ambassador-dies-in-city/articleshow/82122381.cms">to show people how safe it was and died shortly after</a>...</p>
<p>Could Odenkirk's collapse be related to mRNA vaccination? A clot problem? Heart, lung, or brain issue?</p>
<p>Pay close attention. Based on what I'm seeing with real-life first-hand experience, the long term side effects may have begun to emerge in some people.  I'm also noticing cold and flu-like symptoms passing through some fully-vaccinated people that I know.</p>
<p>Like always, <em>it could be coincidental</em> and <em>there's no way to prove a connection</em>... But it sure seems like there's a lot of "coincidences" when it comes to anything related to Covid-19.</p></p>

        <p><em>Copypaste of response to another thread about this:</em></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/banned-paper-doctors-risk-versus-benefit-assessment-of-covid-jabs">this study</a>, mRNA vaccines <em>inevitably</em> cause blood clots, it's just how they work. You might not even notice micro-blood clots initially, but they are a ticking time bomb.</p>
<p>&rt;Just as smoking could be and was predicted to cause lung cancer based on first principles, all gene-based vaccines can be expected to cause blood clotting and bleeding disorders [33], based on their molecular mechanisms of action.</p>

        <p>The sad thing is, we'll never know for certain. Nobody's going to attribute stuff like this to the vaccine. Not a soul. The doctors and "experts" are all in cahoots together.</p>

        <p>Is there another thread in NNN? I searched and Reddit only gave me (censored) threads in (censored) subreddits.</p>
<p>Reddit's search is really bad on desktop, has anyone else noticed that? I'll remove this if someone else posted here but I don't see it.</p>

        <p>Good to hear!  But... How many coincidences before people connect the dots?</p>
<p>At this point people are denying it just because they don't <em>want</em> it to be true. I'm just saying to keep an eye out because it <em>seems</em> like there is a connection.</p>
<p>Every time I mention the issues happening in my own family I get others responding they're seeing the same thing.  Meanwhile, the side effects we see in people are mostly denied as having been caused from the vaccine because it's <em>so dark that people don't want it to be true.</em></p>
<p>But that's not how truth works. It either is or it isn't.</p>
<p>And that's why we shouldn't be censored from asking this kind of question and telling our firsthand experiences with the vaccines and side effects we see happening in real people that we know.</p>

        <p>Why not read the study I linked? It was carried out by a group of physicians and is amply sourced.</p>
<p>It demonstrates that the mRNA vaccines inevitably cause micro blood clots that can lead to a raft of health complications down the road.</p>

        <p>I appreciate that if you are already wary of the vaccine then something like this can confirm your bias in you eyes. However, for as long as I’ve been old enough to use social media/read the news I’ve seen celebrities suffer similar incidents regularly.</p>
<p>There are so many famous people, there are obviously going to be plenty that suffer health problems over a year. I haven’t noticed an increase in these incidents personally, I assume you have - however, you are going to be looking out for these type of incidents to confirm your bias.</p>
<p>I appreciate that you said it could be a coincidence, but I’d like you to accept that there’s a very high chance it’s just a coincidence. Bob is 58 and has drank and smoked during his life - to have a heart related problem is not unlikely.</p>
<p>I fully understand how people can be wary of the vaccine, but I just don’t like to see people utilise things like this for their own agenda.</p>

<p>If's Covid-19? Any death within 30, even 60 days of a test counts.</p>
<p>It might be related, and it might not be. There's no harm in wondering if it might be, especially for those of us who are witnessing firsthand side effects from our own family members.</p>

        <p>I’ve lost family to the virus but lost nobody to the vaccine. I’m vaccinated myself and noticed no side effects besides the typical immediate cold-like symptoms. Both my parents were pretty ill for a few days after getting their jabs, however I appreciate that a few rough days is better than them dying from the virus.</p>
<p>I also understand that what I’ve just said is anecdotal, as is what a lot of people who believe what you believe say. The vaccine has side effects, every vaccine can have side effects. However, I am 99% certain that Bob’s “heart issue” is completely unrelated to him getting vaccine back in March.</p>
<p>People suffered these type of medical problems prior to the vaccine and will obviously suffer them afterwards. I fully appreciate your skepticism but I think you should take more time to come to conclusions.</p>

        <p>It could be. Or it could be PARTLY related as well --- aggravating a pre-existing condition. (Just like Covid-19 deaths.)</p>
<p>My dad is now in cognitive decline months later after the Pfizer shots. He's 75, so once again --- it could be a coincidence. But it didn't start until after the shots.</p>
<p>I lost my mom in 2019 to "stomach flu" unexpectedly while they were on vacation. Old people die. It sucks.</p>
<p>But turning the world upside down like what is happening doesn't help anyone and actually makes things worse. The censorship is doing its job of hiding that. The media is doing its job of dividing people so we fight instead of seeing what a disaster this all is.</p>
<p>As far as "coming to conclusions" - I agree. There's a lot of "maybe" in my post.  Maybe you were jumping to conclusions because subconsciously you're thinking we're right.</p>
<p>In the end? I'd love to be wrong... But I think side effects are emerging and more will follow.</p>
<p>Take a look at the movement regarding Alzheimers. New drug passed even though 11 of the 11 people panel did not vote to approve it. 3 members stepped down in protest.</p>
<p>Biden at the end of May saying, "If we don't act now, EVERY hospital bed in America will be filled with Alzheimers patients!"</p>
<p>I think a higher-than-expected percentage of people who took mRNA vaccines will come down with Alzheimers or a prion disease so similar that it is misdiagnosed.</p>
<p>That new drug? It's $56,000 a year for treatment.</p>
<p>Create the problem, sell the solution?  And if you think this is too dark to be real, you're just being willfully blind. Such horrible things have happened throughout all history. We may just be living through one, now.</p>
<p>Today it emerged that some of the "young people with Covid-19" were crisis actors.</p>
<p>Combine the propaganda, the fear, the censorship, the force, the coercion, the money, the rewriting history ---</p>
<p>There's EVERY reason to be skeptical.</p>

        <p>The same exact companies making the vaccine have been caught selling cancer causing products. Pfizer's stop smoking drug was just revealed to cause cancer. J&amp;J knew their talcum powder contained asbestos and continued selling it for DECADES. Their sunscreen also was revealed to cause cancer.</p>

        <p>Yes! Yes! And yes!</p>
<p>This is all out there, public info. A lot of people even know it.</p>
<p>But at the same time, the same people who know this can't possibly imagine that the vaccines may be harmful to a meaningful number of people!!!</p>
<p>At LEAST enough that it should be a CHOICE. After all, that's all most of us are asking for. A right to say no.</p>
<p>That's hardly an extreme point of view, and yet they've turned it into one. Crazy, right?!</p>

        <p>Much like the communists they idolize, they refuse to even hear any dissenting opinion. If Biden or Pelosi told them we all need to amputate one of our arms for the greater good they’d start sawing. If they said we all needed to kill our first born they’d start drowning. And when they say we need to get rid of dissenters the anti-gun nuts will start shooting. </p>
<p>They’re insanely weak-minded people who need mommy and daddy to hold their hands and tell them exactly how to live their lives. </p>
<p>Mommy and daddy said the shots are safe, so you’re a piece of shit if you don’t get them. And you’re killing grandma. The Democrats who fled Texas to avoid a vote and infected a bunch of people with COVID? They’re heroes though, not grandma killers. The governors who sent elderly people with COVID back to nursing homes to kill staggering amounts of elderly people? Heroes, and we definitely shouldn’t even investigate them. Karl Marx, whose rhetoric led to the murder of more people than all of the World Wars combined times 20? Heroes. A guy wearing an American flag shirt? A violent extremist piece of shit. Why? Because Mommy and Daddy said so.</p>
