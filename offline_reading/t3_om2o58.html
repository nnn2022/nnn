        <p>If the corpses are not stacking in the streets, they'll need to stack some on TV. I guess I realized that after the Douma Report. Killing a bunch of Syrians to have a reason to bomb the country, claiming it was gas (which it evidently was not) documents what lengths the propaganda will go to.</p>
<p>Every nasty thing they have done to other people they will do to us now because we all are "hackable animals", as the WEF puts it. Home bias died when globalism rose.</p>

        <p>Use 'mass grave' footage, even though during a true pandemic of a 'highly contagious airborne killer virus' you would most likely be cremating the bodies for safety.</p>
<p>My favourite is India claiming to burn bodies, when it takes about 300lbs of firewood to burn one body in the open air (verify with a simple search on that fact), yet the footage shows 3 ft campfires..</p>
<p>Do they chop up the bodies first? or fold them up then burn them?</p>

        <p>I don’t see how these facts “are having it both ways.”  Believe it or not, but people like me care about both the unvaccinated and vaccinated alike.  I don’t want the unvaccinated to become infected.  Also your statement “unvaccinated are clearly not presenting a problem to the vaccinated” is not true.  People in the ICU take ample medical resources and man hours to treat.   If we have another surge due to the unvaccinated, then that potentially takes resources away from other non-Covid patients.  Additionally, not all the unvaccinated are unvaccinated by choice.  Some people can’t be vaccinated or won’t respond to it.  So the willingly unvaccinated are a threat to the unwillingly unvaccinated.  Finally, leaving a large population unvaccinated, leaves ample opportunity for the virus to continue to mutate in ways that could affect the vaccinated.  Remember the delta variant arose in a largely unvaccinated region, India, and is now presenting a problem to the vaccinated (not severe, but not great either).</p>

        <p>&rt;As you proceed to try to rebut facts with "what ifs."  You're literally spending an entire post doing exactly that.</p>
<p>Logical outcomes and educated possibilities based on prior knowledge and observation combined with risk-benefit analysis.   Would you argue that someone telling you to wear a seat belt when you're in a car is engaging solely in what-ifs?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;People in the ICU take ample medical resources and man hours to treat.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Only if you forcefully prevent people from seeking alternatives,  like Ivermectin and HCQ.</p>
<p>Do you mean drugs that have either been shown not to work (HCQ) or might possibly in some small studies (other small studies say no) and has definite toxic side effects (Ivermectin).</p>
<p>"I don't want to take a drug that has been tested and shown to work in large-scale clinical studies as well as large population studies and has very low risk.  I want to take a drug that might show some benefit in small-scale, non-blinded tests (dubious) and is toxic in the dosages prescribed."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;If we have another surge due to the unvaccinated, then that potentially takes resources away from other non-Covid patients.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Is that..  likely?</p>
<p>Possible, but hopefully not like last year, probably more isolated to smaller communities.  By percentage, fewer covid patients have to go to the ICU due to improvements in care, but we are seeing an uptick in cases and surges starting in areas that are unvaccinated.  An additional problem with the Delta variant is that while the vaccinated continue to show resistance to it, the previously infected don't show as much resistance and reinfection is a definite concern, so even if you want to believe that most people have been exposed previously it may not mean as much.    Personally, I would hate for someone to be in a car wreck and have to travel an extra hour to another hospital if the local ICUs are filled up.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Finally, leaving a large population unvaccinated, leaves ample opportunity for the virus to continue to mutate in ways that could affect the vaccinated.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Again,  is that likely?  Based on,  what?</p>
<p>Biology.  More hosts mean more virus, more virus means more replication,  more replication means more mutations, and more mutations mean a greater chance for it to evade current resistance.  Case in point, the Delta variant.  It has dropped the efficacy of Pfizer and Moderna against asymptomatic infection from 90% to maybe as low as 68%.  This means that even the vaccinated can become hosts and spreaders again. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And that variant was present before the vaccine was even distributed,  which means,  the vaccine is an attempt to win a fight that simply can't be won by mass vaccination.  </p>
<p>That's simply not true. We have beaten other highly infectious viruses (even more infectious than this virus) through mass vaccination.  What it means is that you can't dilly dally because the virus isn't.  While the vaccinated are more susceptible to this variant, if more people had been vaccinated then the Delta variant might not have been able to make the inroads into the US as it has.   I'm actually optimistic about the vaccines even if the virus ultimately breaks through.  Reformulations of the mRNA vaccines and their testing wouldn't take as long as last year nor will we have to spend months scaling up production.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Which makes the lack of other treatments criminally negligent.  </p>
<p>Criminally negligent are those that are peddling snake oil treatments and absurd false claims.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The MOST OBVIOUS outcome is unprepared for,  and you simply don't want to blame those responsible and are happy to play their game of shifting the blame onto those who owe you no duty of care.</p>
<p>What is the most obvious outcome you speak of and who should I blame?  I'm not blaming anyone yet. *If* this virus finds a way to break out again in the US due to the unvaccinated and I have to watch 100,000's more people die, then I'll get "blamey" (actually, I'll get a lot worse than that).  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>\&rt; who owe you no duty of care.  </p>
<p>And there it is, the real reason behind pretty much everything in this sub.  The inherent selfishness. "I don't believe this will affect me, so why should I even make modest sacrifices that would benefit others."  I am a firm believer that we do owe others a duty of care (and compassion).   While I am agnostic, a phrase I like from the Bible is when Cain asks "Am I my brother's keeper?" It perfectly symbolizes people's unwillingness to accept responsibility for the welfare of their man.</p>

        <p>Just going to ask about your ivermectin point, where has it been shown to be toxic?  From what I know, and I could be wrong, it's listed as an essential medicine by the WHO, has been administered billions of times, and the risk of side effects is so low that it's crazy to not at least try it.  I'm not saying it's the be all end off of covid treatments, but if it could have helped even one person then why is it being pushed aside for vaccines that apparently have plenty of side effects?  I can't comment on HCQ, haven't really looked into that but having heard what Bret Weinstein had to say about ivermectin it just doesn't seem to make sense to not be using it more.  It's also available in generic and costs roughly $1 per dose (can't remember if that's production cost or retail, but either way it's not expensive and as a bonus isn't lining the pockets of pharma execs)</p>

        <p>&rt; ivermecti</p>
<p>It is an essential medicine listed by the WHO and I'm not contesting that.  It is an important drug, especially in 3rd world countries that have rampant parasites especially ones that don't respond well to other drugs.  However, that doesn't mean it doesn't have side effects and has problems with toxicity (especially at the doses needed in vitro for covid (100x FDA approved levels)).  It just means that the benefits outweigh the risks for using it for that purpose.  I would take it if I had those parasites because it is an excellent drug.  I wish it did work for Covid, but the evidence really isn't there and the risk profile is high.</p>

        <p>There's just one gaping hole in your rant- as advertised, NONE of the 'jibber jabs' are vaccines &amp; NONE are ever claimed to grant any immunity to Covid, nor any variant. As advertised, they "may" reduce symptoms. Which means- YOU can get all the variants, you can spread them all, &amp; YOU can fuel their mutation even if you have all doses of whichever 'team' you root for. </p>
<p>3 wonderful Democrats from Texas (all fully vaxxed) just tested positive after their 'superspreader' flight from going to work. WHOOPSIE!</p>

        <p>This is such bullshit. People who refuse to get vaccinated are not the cause of events being canceled. These events can simply demand everybody to be vaccinated and there is no problem. Maybe, just maybe it is cuz they can't sell enough vax-only tickets?</p>

        <p>It’s insidious how the argument has mutated.  Near the beginning of the lockdowns, the narrative was “nah lockdowns are great, no bad effects, go learn to cook new things, stop whining” - many of the horrific consequences of lockdowns were largely suppressed, or at the very least blamed on “the pandemic”.  People who tried to point out the harms of lockdowns were dismissed.  This is because near the beginning, people needed to be sold on the idea in order to comply until they’d gotten into the habit of it.  Now, you hear a lot more stories about the harms of lockdowns, but suddenly the “it’s the sceptics’ fault that the dystopia is being prolonged” argument has been turned waayyyyyy up.  This is tactically smart, because people are so in the habit of obeying lockdowns etc now, and so determined that it must be worth it because otherwise they’ve wasted almost two years of their lives, that they don’t need selling on the idea of lockdowns.  But as more and more lockdown-related suffering has built up, people DO need someone to blame for it all - and thus it becomes our fault, in the eyes of the almighty narrative, that not only are people dying of the virus, but anything bad that comes from lockdowns too.  All our fault, apparently.  That the terrible things we argued against, protested against, are killing people and making people suffer.</p>

        <p>Reminder? We’re in a pandemic!? Bodies falling dead in the streets Wuhan style? No. Hospitals overrun? No. Average age of death higher than life expectancy? Yes.

        <p>It means the jab isn’t ‘sterilizing’ ( doesn’t kill all the virus) it’s similar to antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria... they always warn you not to overuse them for that reason ( don’t kill all the bacteria).</p>
<p>We are currently ( in mine and some pretty famous virologist opinion) over using the vaxx. A more reasonable approach would have been to vaxx the elderly and vulnerable but leave the healthy and young to gain natural immunity. The argument of ‘long Covid’ is specious at best( the numbers of young people suffering from long Covid is minuscule)</p>

        <p>Sure but what’s the totally combined mortality rate for all the vaccines? You shouldn’t really be able to tell me honestly because the majority of these deaths are not being blamed on the vax, but rather “other causes.”</p>

        <p>Do you wear a seatbelt when you drive?</p>
<p>Supposedly it reduces your already low chance of dying in an accident. I wear one, though I’ve never been in a collision. Who knows? The highways departments could be lying about that too.</p>

        <p>Except that you’re comparing apples to oranges. We can see car crashes. We can see and understand why they kill people and how to prevent that. It’s not the same with this virus. As far as I know, nobody has yet been able to successfully isolate the virus itself in cultures, so pretty much everything we “know” about it is based on speculative reasoning that can’t truly be substantiated with actual scientific procedures.</p>

<p>right, you are comparing a year throughout flu season to a couple of summer months. Talking about cherry-picking.</p>
<p>Once the flu season arrives later this year, all you vaccinated sheep going to be down with the flu as every year. But wait, that's not the old variant, that'll be the new OMEGA variant! Funny how that works, right?</p>
