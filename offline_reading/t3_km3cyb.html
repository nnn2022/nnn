        <p>Most vaccine certificates print on paper- buy cardstock(the heavier paper) or coloured paper (office weight) at an office supply store, and buy a lot of colors like yellow, pink, white, blue, etc. These papers will usually be available on your state website, or else, wait until someone on Social Media uploads a copy of theirs (you know someone will). </p>
<p>If you state uploads the vaccine paperwork- print it out on the corresponding color of cardstock, fill it with date, name, information as it would be on the card. Initial it yourself, even if you have a cool doctor or know a medical practitioner in your family- you don’t want them punished or put at risk. Just put random initials or a squiggly line type signature where they would have whoever gave you the vaccine.</p>
<p>If you use the screenshot method, take the screenshot, adjust to make it straight- even if some of the words are blurry, that’s okay. Use a paint program (iOS markup works too) to cover the original persons information. Print it on the right coloured paper in black and white or grayscale, which reduces any variations between colors. Do the same as above with filling it out. </p>
<p>Bam, you’re done! Do as many times as needed for kids in the house/for school records, etc. </p>
<p>If your doctor asks why you aren’t getting the shot with them, tell them that you were very nervous, and got the shot as soon as possible at the first place available to you. If the state seal and everything is filed correctly, they will put it in your medical file/your kids and write you off as vaccinated. </p>
<p>No need for any tech savvy or whatever- learned this tricks from being from an immigrant family and some of us (kids) having missing or incomplete records. Parents didn’t want to pay for additional vaccines when they knew we had them already and did this, gave the forms to our doctor claiming they had just been lost, doctor put it in a computer and we’re all good.</p>

        <p>Just say "I am exempt" and don't wear a mask around your chin, then they know you're fooling them. Happened to some friends, one was wearing a chin diaper, the other was wearing nothing. The one with the chin diaper got told to put the mask over their nose, the one wearing nothing was fine.</p>

        <p>I actually think we will see both digital and paper for awhile. Even though they are doing whatever they can to kill off all the geriatrics, there are still a lot of old people out there with flip phones or no cell phone at all. They will have a tough time getting everyone to use a smartphone and an app. Not because they refuse to but, because a lot of people won't be able to.</p>
<p>This is why I am honing my forgery skills with all this free time we've had lately. Gonna be a huge black market demand for professionally forged covi-passes. Just waiting to see what kind pf paper, ink and security measures they're going to use.</p>
<p>Creating or re-creating an app and digital pass would be very difficult to do.</p>

        <p>Depends on what is going on the QR code. There are a few ways I can see this be implemented:</p>
<p><strong>Pull Only</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Users' phones will poll gov't (or multiple) endpoint(s) to receive / display info and QR on the screen. </li>
<li>Data could have personal information, vaccine status, and risk level (in China, if someone lives in a neighbourhood with someone infected, the colour will change and the person can be denied entry to places)</li>
<li>This is a naive approach that could, theoretically, be spoofed. Depending on encryption, the data can be generated with something as simple as <a href="https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/">an online QR code generator</a></li>
<li>I would say that this is unlikely the approach a gov't will take.... but government software is often shoddy...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pull / Push</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Users phone pulls information listed above along with some database ID.</li>
<li>Scanner scans QR, sends (pushes) data to endpoint where the data is validated against a database.</li>
<li>Validity is returned to the scanner and (likely) the user's location will be stored at the endpoint for ~~big brother~~ contact-tracing purposes.</li>
<li>This would be hard, dangerous, and dumb to spoof. This method would be easy to track and punishment, as would be my guess, <strong>would be severe</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>**Data on the QR code will (if built right) also be encrypted. Essentially, this means that it will be very difficult (near impossible) to see what's on that code. In other words, even if you wanted to spoof it, you won't know how.</p>
<p>Theoretically, if these things are mandated, and if one was very apprehensive about it, the best thing to do would be taking a hammer across the centre of the phone screen to make a QR unreadable. </p>
<p>Personally, I do not think it is worth the risk.... however, and in keeping with the philosophy of this sub, who am I to tell you what to do.</p>
