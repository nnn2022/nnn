        <p>Because I would want to know if I should be self isolating so as to not endanger others? I can be asymptomatic, so I’d want to ensure that I don’t have it.</p>

        <p><strong>And yet asymptomatic people are going to be the most common infected individuals to be out in public</strong></p>
<p>I would be super cautious saying “asymptomatic spread is very rare”, and if you’re quoting the WHO they clarified that it is quite unknown the true rate of asymptomatic spread and the estimated range extends up to 40%. </p>
<p>Even if I took your word for that, if there is even a slight chance of me spreading the virus to someone why would I be reckless and go on about my day in public? Having known an immunocompromised person personally who died a week after being infected, and another who will most likely now have permanent health complications from it, I don’t want to be taking my chances of spreading it to someone even if its “very rare”. It’d be nice if I were infected for it to be entirely asymptomatic (though I certainly was not when I got it), that doesn’t mean the people I spread it to will be as fortunate. </p>
<p>Besides, asymptomatic is just one reason to voluntarily get tested. Why would I not get tested if I was showing mild symptoms for example? This guys comment makes absolutely no sense.</p>

        <p>Ok? What are you implying here lol.</p>
<p>1) Thats not even relevant to the conversation.</p>
<p>2) The only online source I could find that stated “Asymptomatic spread is very rare” (word for word) is from the WHO which is why I brought them up in the first place. The WHO proceeded to clarify their statement that the actual rate is unknown and that the ranges of infection rate presented (researched independently from the WHO by the way) can extend upwards of 40%. They’re only an offhand mention and  hardly add any substance to my point. </p>
<p>3) So what? “Is paid by Big Pharma...” isn’t enough to convince me they’re wrong (you know, because I have the ability to see precisely how the numbers are estimated by researching facilities and can independently verify their claims through simple research myself). In a world dominated by money, how in the hell else are large scale researching organizations going to operate without funding from massive corporations that are interested in the research they find? You do realize that if the data being produced by scientists/researches was a bunch of garbage, Big Pharma wouldn’t have the ability to make products to respond to pandemics (along with literally all of their other operations that involve any amount of scientific research) like these and thereby would lose money themselves. </p>
<p>I mean come on at least try and make your argument convincing.</p>

        <p>This sentence helps let me know that not only do you not know what you’re talking about, you’re also poorly educated. </p>
<p>Most people in this sub do at least have an ability to reason with people and understand how an argument works but it seems like you aren’t able to comprehend how to actually structure even a basic claim. </p>
<p>I hope you’re soon capable of typing more than 3 sentences on Reddit as I trust in due time you’ll be able to, once you come to understand that nobody cares about irrelevant ramblings.

        <p>I know what youre saying and unfourtunately nearly everyone on this whole subreddit is either willfully ignorant or unable to see fact. There's nothing but downvotes to be had for anyone who says anything contrary. I mean, its literally an <em>anti mask</em> sub. I was just going through to have a sad laugh at these people. I mean, see the other reply to this msg, i believe it was "how does a vaccine work?" Like, for real? You could pull straigh facts that youve doxxed from their lives and these people <em>Still</em> wont budge. Im just saying I know its frustrating, but dont doomscroll in all this negativity and frustrate yourself, friend. Hope all is well, stay safe.</p>

        <p>If you actually read this article, it says there was a 20% reduction in transmission, but then it also says it was done in may, where the transmission rate as a whole was much lower, in which the data "could not be accurately assessed." </p>
<p>You literally pointed me to an article with actual data that says both:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We dont have enough data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's a 20% decrease in transmission.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Which literally shows masks are effective. </p>

        <p>"Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection."</p>
<p>It's just a wild guess if they are effective in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It may be a 46% reduction, it may be a 23% increase. Also, yes, that was in May. This time of year, humidity is way higher and it rains a lot. It is known that if masks get moist, there will be fungi and bacteria growth in them. If you inhale deeply, these will enter your lungs deeply. Luckily, we have an immune system that fights these off initially. But the more you wear a mask, the more fibres you will breath in, the more your lungs will get clogged with these fibres, the harder it gets for your immune system to do it's work. These fungi and bacteria will start to accumulate in the parts of your lungs that are supposed to fight off SARS-CoV-2 if it reaches those parts. This fungi and bacteria accumulation can cause Acute Respiratory Failure by itself, now imagine what happens if you catch SARS-CoV-2 on top of that. They will say you died of SARS-CoV-2, while you actually died by compromising your immune system because you were wearing a moist mask full of bacteria and fungi. Keeping yourself healthy is more then trying to lessen transmission of SARS-Cov-2 by taking a precaution that isn't proven to be effective. SARS-CoV-2 isn't the only danger to people's health. Medical interventions are being carried out on healthy people. I just don't think that's the way to go about things.</p>
<p>Now please enlighten me on how vaccines are supposed to work if unvaccinated people are a danger to vaccinated people. </p>
<p>If you're still not safe if you're vaccinated, that must mean vaccinated people are also still a "danger" to vaccinated people. Which would mean there's no use in getting vaccinated right? 
Where is the flaw in this logic? And if there is a flaw in the this logic, doesn't that mean there is a flaw in the logic that vaccinated people are still at risk of getting sick by people that aren't?</p>

        <p>Tbh I thought I knew how vaccines work but now we have 2 people in this thread saying you I have the wrong idea. I was under the impression that if you took the vaccine you gained protection/immunity. But apparently all it does is sterilize you </p>

        <p>I blocked the guy who you responded so idk what he said but yes he absolutely has no clue what he is talking about when it comes to vaccines lmao. </p>
<p>Vaccines don’t guarantee you immunity from viruses/diseases. They give your immune system a far better chance at beating the virus by training it to be able to take it on if it were to enter your system. There is always a small chance though that you can still get infected but it is worlds smaller than if you were to not get the vaccine. Traditionally the go to way of doing this was delivering a weakened or dead version of the virus / pathogen to your immune system to trigger an immune response that can learn how to combat the virus should you get it in the future. With modern vaccines they’ve come up with methods to sequence mRNA to give instructions to your immune system (think of it as a blueprint) which creates the antigens without having to trigger a response with a weakened/dead organism. </p>
<p>They don’t make you sterile :p</p>
<p>Also the original comment he made about vaccines was so off base and had nothing to do with anything I said previously I just decided it was better not to explain it to him.</p>
<p>Edit: also what does desiring lockdowns (whether I do or don’t lmao) have anything to do with me understanding how vaccines work? They’re entirely separate.</p>

        <p>I think everybody grasps the concepts of what a vaccine is. Including the other guy you were messaging But what you just said there about mRNA is false modern vaccines have never implemented it before meaning you are what this sub will call you which is a Guinea pig for a vaccine that may very well cause sterilization. I am not an anti vaxxer I get my annual flu shot. But here is the thing(s) </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Covid is not a deadly virus and essentially the same as the flu in terms of symptoms and death rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flu isn't a deadly virus either but I don't take the influenza vaccine to not die I take it to help save myself from the mild inconvenience that is the flu. This is a vaccine I have been taking for years and has been tested on millions AND took 5+ years to develop not using brand new (untested) science (mRNA).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, desiring to be locked down (a strategy proven ineffective) by your Gov to mitigate the risk of a virus with a 99.99% survival rate for a vast majority of people. Shows a serious lack of independence and the ability to think critically.</p>

        <p>Not gonna insult you, just block you. It literally says the findings are inconclusive. But fun fact it did say phsycological issue may be a deterrent to wearing a mask. So maybe youre afraid of something other than a deadly virus or you were abused as a child, forced not to talk and it brings up bad memories or something. Either way Im sorry a small bit of cloth to keep coughs and sneezes combined with probably the inability to use a new mask everytime or wash the mask you have (probably because youre one of the many Americans who are going broke/you never learned how to wash things) is preventing you from seeing that an article thats inconclusive is exactly that. But I dont wanna give you an anxiety attack that tiny particles will destroy your lungs because its not like doctors before the pandemic wore masks every day and never got these crazy lung deseases you speak of. </p>
<p>For your sake I just hope you ~~dont~~ catch this. My roomate caught it, and he cant run anymore he was a perfectly healthy 29yo- because he was on your side. Didnt believe in masks or anything. Kept going to Venice to party everyday, and so on. Oh- and his GF?! Im not going to laugh but she said its not like its worse than the flu. Now , many months later she still cant taste or smell. But I dont make them feel bad for their mistakes, they wear masks, now. I can only hope you get it so that others can call you a liar- then youll hope they get it, and the destructive cycle will continue while i continue to enjoy my life being able to go on hikes and still able to taste. Oh- and I have controlled asthma (since 5yrs old) and I can breath better than my roomie too- and hes never had astma. </p>
<p>But yea, masks dont matter says a study thats inconclusive. 
Also inconclusive: Aliens really did put those random monoliths up! Prove otherwise!</p>

        <p>In a hospital setting, people are very cautious about when and how they wear their masks, and they have to throw them away in a closed container at least every two hours BECAUSE bacteria and fungi start growing in them. There have been studies about the effectiveness of masks worn by people in hospitals, and the conclusions were it was more of a ritual that they were about to do something important and that everyone should know, than something that's really effective. Some studies even show that their was more transmission of bacteria etc. if people in hospitals wore masks vs they didn't. I'm sorry for your friends. Luckily viruses get weaker as they age and mutatr, otherwise they wouldn't be able to survive. Let's hope vaccination won't ruin that process.</p>
<p>Good luck putting your fingers in your ears (blocking)  people for saying thing you'd rather not hear after yelling at them. Very mature indeed!</p>

<p>Regardless I haven’t done much engaging with people in this sub except for today so it has been a little eye opening to see just how diverse the people are here (from moderate dems who are slightly irked at the government to far righties who literally still don’t think the virus exists in any real capacity).
