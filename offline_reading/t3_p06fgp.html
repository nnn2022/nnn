    <strong>Do you live with someone who wants to get the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>I live with my mum and for the past year and a half she’s been against having the Covid vax. I think the fearmongering is getting to her because now she says she will just take it if she has to because it looks like it will be mandated for every job eventually and all she wants to do is work.</p>
<p>My answer will always be no so I’m starting to feel alone in this fight. I feel like things are going to get very bad soon. What can I do?</p></p>

        <p>Same (gf not mom). Kind of annoying how some people buckle to pressure so easily. Even if there's a vax mandate for groceries you'll likely either be able to get them delivered or get them off the black market (which will inevitably spring up given profit motive).</p>
<p>I don't want the bullshit vax. I will hit the road and live in a van and wait it out if I have to.</p>

        <p>I just assure her of the facts. This is a mental game, and for a smart general to win a battle with loosing as little men as he can, he must break the enemy's will!</p>
<p>What benefits will this vaccine give us? We were lied to about being able to remove the mask. We were lied to how effective and safe this thing is. Yet again people trust those leaders that continue to lie to them?</p>
<p>Where will it stop? They want us to feel alone to break us, you'll never be alone, and we must show others we stand with them...</p>

        <p>I show her the people who have died or had a serious reaction to the vaccine and she questions the validity because she didn’t see it on the news. I don’t know how to talk to her when she jumps back and forth depending on the day. One minute she’s watching something on bichute and the next she’s saying she’ll get the vaccine for a job.</p>

        <p>As far as the news part, Ask her this. Does she believe the media is honest? If she does ask her how does she feel about North Korea and china? If she disagrees with what those countries are doing remind her that stuff didn't happen over night. The media works against the people control by government to push the agenda.</p>
<p>As years go on you can change the minds of the people to do as their told. Thus ending up as a North Korea or china, where people starve and are happy. Told it's part of living here and "all apart of coming together".</p>
<p>Funny how government doesn't really care for it's people unless something is in it for them. I get we all need money to survive, because without it we can eat, sleep, or survive. Unfortunately if you can and it seems right you may have to leave your current area to find a free spot. Only if it is the last resort...</p>

        <p>I’ve said before that things don’t happen overnight. I was talking about what happened with the Jews though. I wonder if she would believe that our country <em>could</em> become another China or North Korea. She’s aware the government have done bad things in the past so why would anyone think they wouldn’t do bad things again so she knows but it’s just like it doesn’t sink in? I don’t get it.</p>

        <p>Fear drives emotions, keep driving fear it'll eventually ruin people. She may feel like there's no way out, like it'll never end. The mindset is different for everyone and allowing someone to see facts and allow them to remember it and care about it, must be tinkered to each person to fit them.</p>
<p>She must get out of fear first in order for her to understand. How? I'm not sure for her situation but I know if all us unvaccinated should be dead already? Covid has been doing it rounds for over a year and a half and yet we haven't lost the billion people like we were supposed to. </p>
<p>Remove the fear and we will return to normal.</p>

        <p>Explain to her that the government is counting on people to do just that, assume it will be mandated and just go ahead and take it. Tell her to wait until it's absolutely forced on her. Ask her how many boosters does she think her body can take before she clots? Tell her it's not gonna stop at just one, they want multiple boosters.</p>

        <p>Yes. My dad at first didn’t want it and now he mentioned he wants to know which one the neighbour had. I guess he’s falling for the "I’m getting older now at 60-something so I’m vulnerable despite being in perfect health otherwise" group. Plus I don’t know how desperate he is to move away from here but he’s the kind of person would do it for an airplane ticket and then stare at me funny for not doing it. He KNOWS I won’t take it, no matter the pressure and guilt-tripping applied to me. He better not be expecting me to take it because I got some news for him. I’m old enough to make my own decisions as pertains to myself and despite us living together for convenience, I’m not afraid to move out on my own and do my own thing.</p>
