    <strong>Parrot Journalism</strong>
    <p><p>Dear Doomers, </p>
<p>I know Covid gave you some purpose in life. Waking up and recounting all of that life-affirming social currency you have hoarded by appealing to the dark desires of the bloodthirsty internet mob must be a blessed existence.</p>
<p>I understand that your magnificent brains can hold more knowledge than us 'crazy conspiracy theorists' could ever possibly entertain; yet you selflessly choose to embrace your civic duty, with attacks on people holding opposing opinions, by reciting the article headlines you skimmed over that morning.</p>
<p>I assume it must be hard being the self-proclaimed smartest person in every room?</p>
<p>Here's the kicker;</p>
<p>If we don't believe what the media tells us, why do you think repeating the media propaganda word-for-word, with zero independent commentary, will make us believe it any more?</p>
<p>We are asking questions that can't be answered.</p>
<p>You are giving answers that can't be questioned. </p>
<p>Just because you believe everything spewed out by the mockingbird media, accept them as the unquestionable arbiters of reality and go around parroting their 'journalism' like you wrote it yourself doesn't make you a hero or more well-informed than everyone else.</p></p>

        <p>Just like If everyone jumped off a bridge would you do it too same concept if your opinion goes against whatever they're trying to push Yes you are the conspiracy theorist You are the racist I get that a lot it's very frustrating but in all actuality I think it's just a small group of people that believe all this a lot less than we are believing it's not the majority</p>
