    <strong>A Flipped, Reversed Narrative</strong>
    <p><p>I think the most ironic doublethink of this whole vaccine thing is what James Corbett recently pointed out... how these FAR-lefties (I'm not talking bout your average "Blue-no-matter-who" center-lefter) these luddite agrarians (that hate cars, complain about ableism yet thinks if everyone just biked instead that would solve everything, they are obsessed with "reducing their carbon footprint" and thinks the problem is that there's just not enough people living off-grid in cobb houses, thrift-store-or-bust, perhaps militaristically vegan, they legit might even be Communists) who once condemned and perhaps loudly protested these huge mega-conglomerate corporations and billionaires up til say about 1 1/2 years ago for their greed, corruption, shady dealings, threats to public health, animal testing, damage to the environment... now these people are all CHAMPIONING the products ("vaccines") of the very corporations they once loudly (maybe even violently) protested!!! You don't need to look far for examples... even just a quick peruse of Facebook and/or Instagram PROVES this with their "gEt VaXxEd YoU mOrOn" posts/pics. The whole political narrative of these leftists being unafraid of Middle-Eastern people even if the media was telling everyone to be suspicious of them because "our freedumz," protesting an illegal war and mass-surveillance state has been flipped 180 degrees with these very same people BEGGING for mandatory vaccinations (the VERY surveillance state they protested 15-20 years ago) even knowing a. these things have had NO long term testing or ANY FDA approval past emergency usage and b. they are STILL afraid of catching COVID because of the reported "breakthrough cases" even though they say "the vaccine reduces symptoms a lot more if you DO get it" and yet were cocksure of "being immune" once the vaccines rolled out and they took the jab!!! They might even be MORE afraid of the virus now that they HAVE the vaccine, buying into the very "fearmongering the media promotes" that they ALSO loudly spoke out against!!!</p>
<p>I feel like this is an extension of what was also pointed out on an episode of Corbett's weekly podcast in which "Punk Rockers get the jab." It's weird seeing these punks (even hardcore underground legends) that should know FIRSTHAND what it's like to be censored and condemned by what was back then normie society and before Clown World (a brutish understatement actually) didn't have ANY problem risking their health or safety with copious amounts of drink, drugs and playing in very dirty, grimy unsanitary venues with slam-dancers and borderline health-code violations now all of a sudden "caring about public health" and promoting getting the experimental under-tested jab from the very corporate giants they sang against... his co-host James Evan Pilato even said this coincidentally was around the time there'd typically be "Punk Rock Bowling" in Vegas. I mean, I get it that the music industry (yes, even hardcore punk in a lot of ways) is in large part about grooming so that might explain something... it sadly makes sense when you hear ALL KINDS of artists of ALL genres busy as hell making protest tunes when an EVIL CONSERVATIVE like Orange Man is in power over ANYTHING he does but where the fuck are they when BENEVOLENT LIBERAL Biden is bombing SOMALIA, one of the most poverted developing countries on earth!?</p>
<p>As a left-leaner myself (last I checked Civil/Social Libertarian counts as left? Might be a slippery slope, dunno) it's like for the past 1 1/2 years I've been watching a crazy real-life Twilight Zone/Outer Limits episode happening in real time.</p></p>
