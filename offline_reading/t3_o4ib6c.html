        <p>Businesses have demonstrated to date that even if someone has a Mask Exemption, they will deny service anyway, and are relying on their re-interpretation of 'private property rights' instead to rationalize their discrimination against people who will not divulge their medical information or comply to wearing a Mask.</p>
<p>I guess it's morally and ethically okay now to require your customers to wear a toilet seat around their neck as a prerequisite to service</p>
<p>These actions really need to be looked at by a lawyer under Discrimination laws.</p>

<p>I have the human rights mask exemption signage on my door and that is the ONLY covid thing you will see in my store. Everyone is free to do what they want, as long as they don't hurt or harass other customers for their own personal views. I am barely scraping by in our tourist town and I don't have the privilege to turn customers away like this idiot in the OP screenshot.</p>

        <p>Oh don't get me wrong, the Cult of the Mask is here too. I just don't give a fuck what anyone else does. It's their personal business, not mine. My store was deemed "non essential" last year, so I guess it's a bit different in that regard. Every other store in my area save for one other non-essential is "mask mandatory" and "one person per household" still, which is ridiculous in my opinion since we've had less than 20 cases since the beginning of 2020. I am unable and unwilling to sacrifice my life and livelihood for a handful of people to get over the sniffles. I hope things in your area get better soon.</p>

        <p>These people are more dangerous than you think.  We stand here and wonder how humanity can cause and stand by all the evil that has occurred throughout history.  Well, this is how it starts.  Call me crazy, I don’t care.</p>
<p>I have serious particle respirators but I don’t wear them.  I did last year before we realized what was released onto the world and things were very uncertain.  Still, I caught covid along with many other NYC area commuters I know.   We all survived.  Even my parents in their 60s caught it in August and while it was like a bad flu they’re fine now.  We all believe this virus is man made based on how it felt.  It’s unreal if you had a genuine case, although there are many fake PCR tests… Fun fact, the inventor of the PCR test was a vocal critic of Fauci and didn’t consider PCR a reliable test for viral infection.  He conveniently died in 2019.  Look it up, I wish I was lying.</p>
<p>After surviving Covid I completely lost any fear of catching it again, and began to worry more about the civil liberties implications of everything happening.  Once it seemed like having covid once provided lasting protection, and 2 blood draws showing I have covid antibodies over the last year I began just barely playing along with the mask theater.  Especially after all the riots last summer and being told that wouldn’t increase numbers…. What a crock.  Anyone with half a brain can put two and two together and realize this isn’t a real pandemic.</p>
<p>My office has been remote for 15 months now.  New York State is more or less fully reopen, but for how long?  I see this as the eye of the storm.  2020 was to see how much people would tolerate having their civil liberties stripped, and humanity performed poorly.</p>
<p>Don’t be shocked when some cooked up variant phobia brings back covid restrictions.</p>
<p>Just look at what’s been happening in Canada, The UK, and many other countries.  We’re lucky in the USA, despite how much our liberties were challenged over the last year+</p>
<p>Buckle up folks.  Employers here are already mandating it.  I’m expecting more businesses to start asking for proof of vaccination to go maskless.  They aren’t yet but don’t be shocked if it’s suddenly implemented.  In the end the vaccination is going to be forced through employers, schools, travel restrictions.  You can resist but the dehumanization of those who aren’t vaxxed is well underway</p>
<p>This crisis is far from over.  In fact we’re just wrapping up the first chapter.</p>
<p>I wish I sounded less doomer, but I’m in my mid 30s.   My coming of age event was 9/11.  I entered the workforce right after the 2008 financial collapse.  My wife and I wanted to start a family, but not in this world.  I’d rather not have that leverage over me right now, which is sad, but maybe adoption is my fate.</p>
<p>What’s happening to the youth makes me absolutely sick.  The fact that an experimental “vaccine” is being forced upon children as young as 6 months, for an illness that doesn’t even affect them… I have no other word for it except for pure evil.</p>
<p>I didn’t want this reality, but it’s here.  Defend your freedom now or prepare to lose it forever.  Prepare to get uncomfortable.  I’m praying for the best but preparing for the worst.</p>
<p>I wish I could paint a rosier picture but this is our reality now.</p>

        <p>You know with what you pointed out about children getting the vaccine you’re absolutely right according to the CDC‘s own numbers about 300 people and some change have died from Covid who were age 0 to 17 but the flu in the 2017 to 2018 flu season killed 600 people and some change who were age 0 to 17 so obviously the flu is far more dangerous for kids then Covid is.</p>

        <p>Right!? I’m just so appalled at how the world has treated my autistic 5-year-old over the past year. Absolutely no understanding, wasn’t even allowed to go back to school in person because she’s unable to tolerate a mask on her face (or the mandatory weekly covid swabs). The powers that be have decided that disabled people don’t matter anymore and it’s sickening to see how many institutions and individuals have adopted the same attitude :(</p>

        <p>If I could have a little rant of my own the autism community tends to lean very far left in terms of politics where is I am rather right leaning and if you disagree with them on anything they will badger you and disown you basically. And that applies to masks and Covid vaccines as well it even seems like the autism community has forgotten about sensory issues during Covid I’ve been called a murder for an awful person etc. etc. for my views on masks and vaccines. Go over to r/autisticpride and you’ll see photos of the people on the sub posing with the Band-Aids talking about how they are now super autistic or that their autism levels are maxed out now now granted I understand it’s meant to be a cheap jab at the anti-VAX community but still it’s just so cringe and ridiculous. Now granted I’m not like your five-year-old daughter I can tolerate a lot I can wear the mask and I’ve been swabbed many times but that doesn’t mean I can’t have sympathy for the ones that are hit really bad by the disorder who can’t wear the mask or deal with the swabs.</p>

        <p>I really appreciate your empathy and I agree it’s sorely lacking on the autism subs these days. I used to read r/autism to learn more about autistic viewpoints but I also had to stop with all of the political and covid vaccine worship posts. Reddit primarily consists of young, left-leaning adults (and probably lots of bots/shills) so I guess it makes sense that even the autism subreddits reflect that. But it’s really unfortunate that a community that prides itself on diversity is unwilling to consider other political/societal viewpoints. It is totally cringe that they think questioning the covid vaccine safety is akin to being an anti-vaxxer… the world is so much more nuanced than that. My daughter is up-to-date on every traditional vaccine but there is no way in hell I’m letting them inject that experimental crap in her. The propaganda has worked all too well on the masses and it’s very scary. For whatever it’s worth I appreciate your political stance and going against the mainstream narrative!!</p>

        <p>I mean I totally agree with you Mimi yeah I’m up to date on all my current vaccines but there’s no way I’m going to let them inject me with an untested non-FDA approved vaccine especially considering that to people in my family have already had Covid and pull through it just fine and I’m going to get an antibody test next time I go to the doctor just because I got really sick but I tested negative but I want to get an antibody test to see if I have the antibodies. And if you wanna learn more about me personally in my political stance as a conservative autistic person I actually have a podcast titled Thoughts From an Autistic Conservative If you wanna check it out</p>

        <p>No awareness of how corrupt and unethical it is for doctors to refuse to confirm mask exemptions for anyone for any reason. My doctor told me this as well. The CDC literally gave lists of reasons/conditions that prevent mask wearing, but doctors got together and decided not to follow CDC recommendations?? Sounds like a conspiracy if I ever heard one....</p>
