    <strong>I'm really peeved by the use of the word "conspiracy" lately, even the "conspiracy theorists" are using it wrong. Stop playing their games!</strong>
    <p><p>I've been seeing a lot of posts and comments, even from the side of the "conspiracy theorists", that use the word "conspiracy" to mean "made up". E.g.: "it's not just a conspiracy, it's proven"; "I believe X, but Y is just a conspiracy".</p>
<p>Conspiracy: 1_ A secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful. 2_ The action of plotting or conspiring.</p>
<p>A "conspiracy theory" therefore is any yet unproven theory about some group, any group, conspiring in some way against another. "Theory" is the word that denotes doubt in the story's validity, not "conspiracy". The word "conspiracy" in itself has a clear definition and has nothing to do with the veracity of the story.</p>
<p>As a side note, the "conspiracy theorist" in me is inclined to believe this is yet another effort to twist our language in a way that allows the very concept of a conspiracy to be dismissed by the general public. It starts by the wrong use of the word, conflating it with the concept of "some made up story", and ends with our minds, whenever someone mentions something that sounds like "a group plotting in secret", making the unconscious link "that's a conspiracy; conspiracy = made up; this is immediately dismissible".</p></p>

        <p>The term "Conspiracy Theorist" was pushed by the CIA to discredit people who had questions about the Kennedy assassination, since then it has grown to be a useful rhetorical bludgeon against anybody who questions the narrative.</p>

        <p>It needs to be more widely known that the CIA actively interferes with public discourse.</p>
<p>They try to coin terms like "conspiracy theorist" and "antivax" to create social pressure not to question anything the government says or does.  It's cringe to watch people call others antivax when they don't even realize two of these shots aren't vaccines at all.</p>

        <p>Youâ€™re absolutely right, â€˜theoryâ€™ is the word that should be getting that usage, and the improper usage annoys me very much too. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s really alarming how the conspirators have managed to effect every life worldwide, thats 7 billion peopleâ€”how is anything more corrupt and criminal than that?

        <p>I think it's because the word "theory" still holds validity to a lot of people, it's still used when referring to "legitimate" research and such. As in, "that's just a theory" doesn't immediately scream "therefore it's bullshit" to most, it just implies the jury is still out on that one. And sure, that is the case for many of these "conspiracy theories" that haven't been proven wrong, so "theory" is the correct term; but I feel the public needs a word that just dismisses the theory, so they stick to "conspiracy".</p>

        <p>I agree, they use it because they think it means â€˜absurd and crazy stuffâ€™</p>
<p>So to them, â€˜conspiracy theoryâ€™ means:
Absurd &amp; crazy stuff  theory</p>

        <p>I always try explaining this. Like people conspire everyday. Maybe the more appropriate word would be conspiracy hypothesis</p>
