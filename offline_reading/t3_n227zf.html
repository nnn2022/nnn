    <p><p>Hope that this will end well, hope that more people will wake up, hope that your actions and information will be helpful in waking anyone up, hope that your life will ever be more than a Groundhog Day treadmill ever again?</p></p>

        <p>I’m deeply disappointed in what seems like 75% of the global population. They are hypnotized zombies.  <br>
Is a happy life even possible now?  <br>
I was kinda struggling before the scamdemic and I stayed strong with hope this past year, but for some reason this week I’ve felt so lost and depressed.</p>

        <p>I go through cycles. But knowing that they are fighting so hard to suppress debate encourages me. If there were no hope for us there would be no struggle for them.</p>
<p>That, and my belief that we are eternal beings and that this realm is only temporary.</p>

        <p>Yes I get some solace by the same belief of eternal beings in a temporary realm. However it’s going to be a looong temporary.</p>

        <p>I'm a very resilient and positive person and that is coming in handy now. I have plans for just about every scenario. But so far it's just the same Groundhog Day you mentioned. I still have bad days, but I also still have hope that things won't get any worse and will change for the better. There's no reason for me to worry about things before they happen. That could lead to more anxiety and possibly depression. I suppose all of this is easier for me in the US. I feel terrible for people who are in worse situations or have fewer coping skills.</p>

        <p>Honestly at this point I've given up hope that people will wake up. I believe that those who haven't woke up never will and the ones that have are to few in number, im just waiting for it all to come crashing down.</p>
<p>Get in shape, stock up on long shelf life foods, get your ammo and get your guns. Its gonna get nasty. Good luck to you and yours.</p>

        <p>I know a woman that works in a my local rite aid who is the kindest woman ever. Honestly, I've always gotten along with her. But now that they have the vaccine she asks me almost every other time "So.. are you thinking of getting it yet?".</p>
<p>I understand that's it's small talk and there's no problem with that - The issue is that she doesn't get IT. She doesn't comprehend the fact that there are some people who really have no interest in putting this shit in their bodies.  </p>
<p>That's the way things are now. Can't waste energy be angry or upset. It's sheer confusion that some of these otherwise normal people you run into day to day are brainwashed. I have no faith in them to change. Why would they?</p>
