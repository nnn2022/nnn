        <p>This makes me pretty angry and distressed but at the same time it's also hilarious. Are people really going to follow this? I don't really have a clue what the rules in the UK are anymore but I've been having people over to my house for dinner during this whole thing, those who would come anyway, and in San Francisco you need a permit to have a 'small outdoor meal gathering'?  You mean a picnic or a bbq, or are those words we only used in the before times?  Can you be prosecuted for having some friends round for dinner inside?</p>

        <p>Approximately 1/1000 people in the UK have died of Covid this year, about 65 thousand people. Those are people’s parents, siblings, coworkers, teachers, neighbors, etc. who are never coming back. It is a mind boggling tragedy. Objectively the UK has done an absolutely terrible job handling this crisis. (To be fair, at the federal level the USA has also done a terrible job.)</p>
<p>The death rate from Covid in San Francisco is between 10 and 20 times lower than the UK. Fingers crossed that it stays that way.</p>
<p>(The exact numbers of people who died without being explicitly tested are hard to judge in SF, as the absolute numbers are low and get lost in the noise of deaths by other causes, but it is plausible that e.g. a couple dozen homeless people have died from Covid or from causes related to the pandemic, without being included in the official tally because they didn’t get tested.)</p>

        <p>This is a load of rubbish, I'm in the UK and have no idea where you got your covid deaths, but it's about 40,000 right now, nowhere near 65,000. Like everywhere else, the vast majority of these are very elderly or sick people who would likely have died within a year anyway, many of those in nursing homes. It is very far from a mind boggling tragedy when a bad flu season like 2017 can claim 30,000 lives, again of people with a median age of 80.  Not only that, many of those deaths are not of covid but with it, in most cases covid is not the primary cause of death. Classifying these people as parents, siblings or whatever is true of course (everyone is), but you make it sound like young healthy people were dropping like flies in a hopeless appeal to emotion which is just a complete lie. I don't know anyone who has lost someone to covid.  Every year, over 600,000 people die in the UK, 78,000 of those die from smoking related illnesses, so if this is a 'mind boggling tragedy', then we have a much worse one every single year from an easily preventable cause.  The likelihood is even given all of this, by the end of the year there will be little, if any, excess mortality in the UK on an annual basis.</p>
<p>I couldn't agree more however that our response has been awful and the government did nothing to target measures at the places that actually needed them - nursing homes. Overall, that isn't much different from anywhere else though, as nowhere really implemented the correct measures to protect the vulnerable and at risk groups.  The truly mind boggling tragedy is the collateral damage that lockdown has caused, with an estimated extra 10,000 dementia deaths alone caused primarily by neglect during lockdown, let alone the enormous amount of excess deaths caused by missed medical procedures and mental health issues. 
All of that without even considering the economic impact.  However, this is the same in the USA as well.  </p>
<p>None of this changes the fact that the measures described in this paper are completely insane security theatre, not measures that will have any impact on death rates, as any measures must be targeted at those actually at risk who are the very old and very sick.  The epidemic is already over so implementing measures now is completely illogical.  Perfectly healthy 30 year olds have zero reason to do anything differently from normal. The UK wants to implement similar things as described in this paper here, the reason I said I have no idea what the UK measures are is that I stopped following them as they are completely pointless - unfortunately most other people here are still following like the sheep they are.  Masks are meant to be mandated on public transport here but I just ignore it and noone has said a word to me yet.  The UK had all this stuff and people here are obeying it for the most part but it made no difference at all to the outcome.  I'm just completely shocked that people will follow these insane orders.</p>

        <p>If you track total deaths in the UK, it is about 65,000 more this year than the average of the past several years. Those deaths are either Covid (many undiagnosed or e.g. recorded as “pneumonia”) or otherwise caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>This may even be an undercount, as in industrialized places where there has not been any Covid epidemic, deaths are slightly down this year due to people’s lack of movement and extra precautions.</p>
<p>&rt; measures described in this paper are completely insane security theatre,</p>
<p>Staying physically distant from people goes very far to avoid passing respiratory viruses. Such viruses are contracted by either (a) breathing in small droplets of someone else’s spit, or (b) touching a contaminated surface and then touching your nose/mouth.</p>
<p>A large number of recent studies have confirmed that widespread wearing of face coverings is very effective at reducing the reproductive number of the virus, in fact more effective than people expected a few months ago.</p>
<p>&rt; Masks are meant to be mandated on public transport here but I just ignore it </p>
<p>Allowing your own selfish impulse to avoid trivial inconveniences to drive your behavior is profoundly antisocial, and at a large scale such antisocial behavior goes a long way toward explaining differences in results between countries.</p>
<p>Not abiding by simple trivially inconvenient precautions that might save your neighbor’s life doesn’t make you a clever antiauthoritarian free spirit. It just makes you an asshole.</p>
<p>You’d fit right in with these people though https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9p-ECR69o0</p>
<p>&rt; Perfectly healthy 30 year olds have zero reason to do anything differently from normal.</p>
<p>Even perfectly healthy people in their 30s (like myself) generally have older neighbors, friends, relatives, coworkers, etc. Beyond that, a large number of young people are obese, diabetic, hypertensive, immunocompromised, etc. Being young and healthy with an appetite for personal risks is not inevitably tied to having no empathy for others in a riskier position.</p>
<p>But beyond that, this virus kills perfectly healthy young people at a far higher rate (well over 10x) more than influenza. Speaking only for myself, if I can avoid a 1/1000 chance of death (roughly the odds for a person in their 30s who gets infected) by mostly staying away from people for a few months and wearing a face mask when I go to the grocery store, I’ll take it.</p>
<p>&rt; The epidemic is already over</p>
<p>This is certainly not the case in San Francisco, where something on the order of 1% of the population has already been infected.</p>
<p>&rt; 78,000 of those die from smoking</p>
<p>Thankfully smoking is not a contagious viral infection. But you are right that public health efforts should be focused toward discouraging people from smoking, perhaps by making tobacco producers liable for the health costs incurred by their consumers.</p>

        <p>Highlights:</p>
<p>&rt;1.2. All Small Outdoor Gatherings must be scheduled to conclude in no more than two hours. The duration of all gatherings should be limited to the maximum extent possible.</p>
<p>&rt;1.3. Participants must not move among simultaneously occurring Small Outdoor Gatherings or switch places with Participants in other simultaneously occurring Small Outdoor Gatherings. Participants are strongly discouraged from attending more than one Small Outdoor Gathering per day, and should not attend more than two Small Outdoor Gatherings per week. The more contacts a person has with others, including during Small Outdoor Gatherings, the more they are placing themselves and others at risk of transmitting the virus</p>
<p>It even includes a checklist.</p>
