    <strong>Bureaucrats hanging on by their fingernails</strong>
    <p><p>I just had a random thought I'd like to share.  I've posted before about 'follow the money' with scientists and doctors or as I like to call it 'The profit incentive in misdiagnosis' so let's go with some of the things we're talking about a 'I got the shot' card? tattoo?  whatever?  To attend a sporting event, concert, travel, whatever.  Does anybody besides me think that there's a little bit of 'man if I make and push this rule I'll be in this kush job for another 20 years'?</p>
<p>At the end of the day people are selfish, greedy, and only out for themselves.  A person can be kind and philanthropic but as Tommy Lee Jones said 'a person is smart but people are dumb, dangerous, panicky animals and you know it'.  </p>
<p>Look it's a random thought and I might be totally off base but I'd like to hear what you think.  I'd like to hear your opinions fellow NNN'rs.</p></p>

        <p>I believe money is what it has been about for some time.</p>
<p>I get spam every day about no-contact thermometers.   People are designing and selling 'smart masks' that tell you when to breath and when to clean them.   Large corporations like Amazon are making billions more in profit.</p>
<p>All kinds of apps are coming out to allow you to prove your vaccine status - and remind you to get your next shot.</p>
<p>And vaccine makers look to make billions more from endless shots and booster shots.   Plus new shots for every new variant or new virus that comes along.</p>
<p>Covid has become a major industry.</p>

        <p>what are your thoughts on it?  I may be totally off base.  We might even disagree but here in NNN I would think that intelligent discussion, discourse, and even argument, in search of the truth would be a welcome thing.</p>

        <p>I agree, the state ultimately exists to serve itself, so this kindly of behaviour is to be expected. Who owns a country? The state. What is the state? A nonprofit entity which distributes its spoils to those working for it and those benefitting it first, the people which itâ€™s supposedly accountable to second.</p>

        <p>And yet that goes against everything this country was founded on.  I do not disagree with you.  But everyone working for the state has a profit incentive in carving out a little more here and there for them until us normal citizens are just cattle to them.</p>
