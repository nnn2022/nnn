    <strong>Public opinion plays a vital role in misleading people</strong>
    <p><p>People only give into the psychosis, because everyone else is doing it. Were the same people who are now pro-lockdown  mask-lovers running around during the H1N1 pandemic and yelling at everyone to "wear a fucking mask"? Of course not. The same people who are calling you a "braindead tinfoil anti-mask lunatic" never wore masks even during the regular flu season. Their whole personality is shaped on the public opinion. They aren't capable of critically thinking so they only follow what's the public opinion without even questioning it. They actually think the science on mask efficiency simply changed over night. The same people who are now so obsessed with this dystopia right now, would act in discust if they were told prior to March 2020 that this is how our future would look.</p>
<p>The media knows how to do it's magic and decieve people into doing something that they would have never ever even think of doing prior.</p>
<p>I think this <a href="https://youtu.be/GA8z7f7a2Pk">video</a> nicely explains what I'm talking about. People only follow something when everyone else is doing it. In the animal world we call them sheep.</p></p>

        <p>I did get a sinking feeling while watching that. I think it's a good example. The first few people are cool in my book, the rest are contemptible drones. Oh, and  the person repeatedly  bleeting like a goat didnt mitigate that impression.</p>

        <p>Great video! It really does a great job demonstrating joiner-mentality. People went from staring at that guy like he was a lunatic, to sprinting to join him. It was like watching a fire rage out of control. This was something positive, a dance party. But the same group-mentality happens with negative social trends as well,  as we're seeing with the mask wearing trend.</p>

        <p>Yes, to be honest I don't blame them for joining in the dance! Like have fun lol. But it's a demonstration of how easily people can be brought into something which they first think it's silly.</p>
