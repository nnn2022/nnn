        <p>They have been doing this “variant” garbage almost the entire time and I have yet to see any meaningful data that shows the variants even mean anything, except to promote endless vaccines. I’m surprised they keep pushing it as almost 100% of the time, viruses mutate to become more virulent and LESS deadly with each mutation.</p>

        <p>Well, you aren’t right about mutations making the virus less or more dangerous. Mutations occur randomly as the virus replicates its RNA strand of genetic information multiple times. They happen when genetic code is appended, modified, or removed. There is no such linking of genetic mutations causing a virus to be better or worse.</p>

        <p>I never said that mutations specifically cause viruses to be less deadly. It is a natural result of evolution that viruses become less deadly over the course of their mutations, because if they kill their host too quickly or too often then they won’t be able to replicate and spread as easily.</p>
<p>In fact usually when they talk about C19 mutating, they make a point to say that usually viruses become less deadly, but for some reason that has no basis in reality, scientists have tenuous reasons to believe that maybe this one is the special exception that is going to do the opposite.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile there are already thousands of "variants". Focusing on a couple and making them region specific suits the narrative better</p>

        <p>They pushed the variant story back in April 2020 when they claimed that the NY variant (actually, back then they were so lazy they actually called them STRAINS) came from Europe and was more virulent than the strain infecting the western costal states. </p>

<p>I read a lot and even I cannot keep up with the variants (at least they are no longer sloppily calling them strains) that they manufacture every week. "Eek" and "Indian" variants is just desperation! When do we get the Kazakh, Swiss, Fijian, Uruguayan, Lesotho and even Bhutan variants? How can anyone still believe any of this???</p>

        <p>Meet the new racket. Same as the old racket.</p>
<p>&rt;”Though of <strong>practically no value in the prevention of death from pneumonia, the serum itself may cause menace to the health and life of the patient, as may any other serum.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;The research workers in the field <strong>refused to acknowledge the obvious failure of the anti- pneumococcus serums.</strong> Their position and influence enabled them to <strong>maintain themselves as “authorities” and to force the acceptance of their obviously erroneous views.</strong>  They created numerous refinements in <strong>the typing of germs which progressively increased the number of types from four to over thirty.  This enabled them to place the blame for the failure of the serum on the method of typing.</strong>  The greater number of types made it more readily possible to <strong>manipulate the results obtained</strong> in such manner as to <strong>make the serum appear a bit more successful.</strong>  But the total <strong>death-rate</strong> of all types of pneumonia was <strong>not materially reduced.”</strong></p>
