    <strong>Why is This All Happening? COVID Doomerism as a Fundamentalist Cult of the Religion of Progress</strong>
    <p><p>The question of "Why is this happening?" isn't an easy one, and in my view has many answers. There's been plenty of discussion of direct causes, which include propaganda by the government and media, and what factors might be behind it, whether the agendas of western elites or the CCP.</p>
<p>Those are important questions, but the question that I'm most interested in is, why have so many ordinary people accepted this extreme overreaction so thoroughly? If the overwhelming majority of people saw through it, there's no way this could still be going on for over seven months.</p>
<p>Fear is an important part of it, but I don't think it can be explained solely by ordinary fear. Plenty of COVID doomers accept greater risks in other areas of their lives. What I'm seeing is a cultlike fanaticism, a fixation similar to some religious fundamentalists that I've known.</p>
<p>I've learned about the concept of "civil religions" from the author John Michael Greer. These two essays are a good introduction to the concept</p>

<p>He identifies the religion of Progress as being central to the modern world. The religion of Progress assumes that history follows a linear trajectory toward a future utopia, as long as we follow the right path, if we stray too far from the path we'll end up with the opposite of Progress, the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't believe in the central tenet of the religion of Progress, since what is progress and what isn't gets changed so often. For example, for some versions of Progress, cutting down forests to build factories is part of the march of Progress, in other versions, preserving those same forests is the objective. I think progress (with a small p) is a useful word when describing work done toward a specific goal, be it personal or political, but with the understanding that not everyone shares that goal. I can make progress in building a shed, but it's possible the neighbor thinks its ugly and wishes I hadn't built it. There have been both good and harmful things done in the name of Progress, and I'd prefer if things were justified on their own terms rather than hiding behind the mantle of Progress.</p>
<p>The believers in the religion of Progress don't think as I do, and they have been feeling more and more threatened. Twenty years ago, most people (in America at least, I'm speaking from an American perspective and it's be interesting to hear from others in other countries on this matter) assumed Progress was inevitable, but more and more people have been questioning that recently. When the power of a religion is waning, its adherents often double down on it and get more and more authoritarian in their drive to force others into their ideology. The worst of the inquisition, witch burnings, and other abuses of the church happened after the Reformation offered a serious challenge to the established order of medieval Europe.</p>
<p>We're seeing a similar situation in regards to the religion of Progress. don't think this sort of response would have happened pre-2016. Trump (and Brexit) have upset the established order of Progress, the high priests of Progress (the "experts") don't hold as much sway as they used to, and believers are doubling down on increasingly debased ideas about Progress. I remember the week in March when so many people flipped to doomer mode, mostly people who weren't unusually germaphobic and hadn't paid much attention to COVID before then. That was the week when beating COVID became important to the religion of Progress. The doomers can't see it as simply a virus with a relatively low fatality rate because to most of them it's more of a religious revival, one last chance for Progress to reboot and vanquish its enemies. To them, if we fail to beat COVID we will soon be back to the dark ages or worse.</p>
<p>That way of thinking is hopefully increasingly backfiring, as more and more people see places like Sweden and South Dakota as happier, healthier places to be than the dystopian nightmare that is sold to us as Progress.</p></p>

        <p>Once, America worshipped the God of the Bible.</p>
<p>Then, we decided that His rules were old-fashioned and restrictive, and we could do so much better without.</p>
<p>The problem is, people need to believe in <em>something</em> one way or the other.  When Christianity was thrown out, Fear, or Progress with Fear as its guiding principle, became its secular replacement.</p>

<p>Also, I would never have expected a reference to John Michael Greer on this subreddit.</p>
