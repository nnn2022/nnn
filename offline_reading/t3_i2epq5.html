        <p>It blows my mind how quickly the virtue signaling, suicide hotline copy-pasting fake concern just completely disappeared when a more popular cause emerged.  Poof.  No one gives a fuck about mental health anymore</p>

        <p>It reminds me when BLM exploded recently. So many basic people on social media changing their profile picture, #BLM, BLM IS EVERY DAY NOT JUST TODAY, posting virtue signalling posts about how anyone who doesn't eternally support them should unfriend them etc.</p>
<p>Then a couple of weeks later, when it's no longer trendy, goodbye to the hashtag or anything else related to them.</p>

<p>This one alsways drove me crazy. They didn't post it because the cared about some stranger thousands of miles away, they posted it to look good, to get karma, or for their own sake so the didn't feel bad, but not for any legitimate concern.</p>
<p>God forbid you called them out on it too.</p>

        <p>That’s exactly what happened. It stopped being the cool cause to fight for and really only was said cause when connected to a celebrity like Robin Williams. When it comes to regular people, it’s very often cast aside and it definitely is now. Deaths only matter now if they are covid.</p>

        <p>Pretty much the equivalent of "do a flip!" To jumpers. The doomers don't care. Especially if they are non essential and get by getting everything delivered. What happens when those deliveries don't happen because people become to engrossed in fear or too depressed at the state of things? Lets be honest. Before this shit, mental health was hanging by a thread. But at least we had ways to blow off steam. Gym, going out, seeing friends, traveling, just walking. Even the most introvert (like me) can take solace in some activity and not be constantly judged just for walking. It was cute in the beginning but now people are starting to lose it. Both sides. Bringing out ridiculous counter arguments that if this was the Holocaust, you will be dead for your "freedoms". It is insane to try to communicate to these people.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen so much of this in so many situations and it makes me want to vomit. I had an acquaintance from college, who was very pro me too and protecting and advocating for survivors of sexual assault and trauma and their wellbeing for the longest time, loudly state that anybody claiming not to be able to wear a mask due to PTSD (my situation) is lying and just using it as an excuse and if it’s really an issue she’s “sorry you went through that but you now don’t have some special case to endanger everyone else and need to stay home” 🙄🙄</p>

        <p>👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻exactly! Why should I have to go through intense distress just to get the stuff I need to live and also have a semi enjoyable life (as much as possible right now) because you’re too afraid or mad about a few people not wearing masks? If you’re that bothered by it why aren’t you the one that’s expected to and should be staying home? I didn’t ask for my trauma, I didn’t ask to be unable to cover my airways. But it happened and I’m doing my best right now, I distance far from everyone in the store, why do I deserve this level of hostility?</p>

        <p>The most ridiculous part is that the virus isn’t going to be spreading in stores. It takes prolonged contact with someone, and not when you’re passing by someone in the bread aisle with your cart for 5 seconds. </p>
<p>People are so uneducated about the virus and have chosen to believe everything they hear from the garbage MSM. If some people would read actual studies and information about IFRs, they’d understand that this is completely overblown. Instead they choose to believe anecdotal evidence. </p>
<p>I don’t do well sitting at home for long periods of time due to anxiety and depression. But yet, these shrews no longer care about mental health since it’s not convenient or doesn’t matter anymore. Who cares about suicide when there’s a virus around. They need to GTFO with that excuse.</p>

        <p>Yes because I frequently go around just coughing and sneezing out into the open to splatter it all over everyone, allll the time. /s</p>
<p>I carry Kleenex with me. I try to hold coughs and sneezes in right now because god knows you’re looked at like the world’s worst human if you do so in public right now, but if I can’t I cover with a tissue and also put my face in my elbow, so I give myself two barriers there. </p>
<p>I studied public health and global health crises funnily enough. I’d never do anything (out of the ordinary-I mean hey car accident stats are bad so some normal things we all do are actually a public health threat believe it or not) that actually endangered public health. I’m highly educated (not to toot my own horn or anything) and do have a background in epidemiology and how to deal with the spread of a disease as it becomes a pandemic. I am, however, also allowed to care about my own health and I do so in a way that is not endangering anyone whatsoever.</p>

        <p>This makes sense. I can understand how a mask may make someone feel claustrophobic or give the sensation that they can't breathe, which could cause someone to panic. Some people have genuine reasons they can't wear a mask. I know other people have talked about having disabilities that make it so they can't wear one, too, although I'm not actually sure what disabilities that would be... Maybe ones where they have difficulty breathing, so the added layer of a mask would make it too challenging for them to catch their breath? </p>
<p>Either way, I think it's fine if some people can't wear a mask, and I worry about people ganging up on or judging those few who really can't because there are so many people pretending they can't and being defiant assholes about it. It's like how people who pretend their poorly behaved dogs are service dogs just to get special treatment, and that makes it harder for people who truly need their service dogs with them in public spaces. I'll wear my mask and keep my distance to try to help everybody stay safe, and be respectful of anyone who can't wear one... I just hope those who don't wear them still try to keep their distance from other people to avoid getting themselves or other people sick.</p>

        <p>I used to be immunocompromised, but I consider myself to be healthy now because I’ve been stable for a little over three years. 
People used to go out when they had a cold or even the flu all the time. They’d get close to people, touch everything, cough everywhere... it was gross. 
That’s the only reason I had my own mask years before  this whole thing started. I used to be so afraid of getting sick.</p>
<p>But all of a sudden, they care now... </p>
<p>While I do wish they had the decency to stay home if they were sick, I don’t think everyone should stay locked up in their houses all the time just because of people like me.</p>

        <p>The one thing I do hope stays is that some people are starting to have a more cautious attitude about illness in general. Because it <em>is</em> reasonable to expect for immunocompromised people to be able to operate in the world at least somewhat normally. Flus and other viruses people get every year do put more vulnerable people at risk. I know I've been guilty of going around normally when I've been sick in prior years. If it turned out that I had gotten someone like you sick inadvertently and ended up putting them in the hospital or worse, it would devastate me to know that. While we can't stay in our houses all the time just on the off chance we might spread a virus, I think it's a healthy idea to promote that if you're sick, stay home, and if you can't stay home, it's probably good to normalize mask wearing. It would be good if we could come out of all of this with a culture where it's just considered the right thing to do to make it as safe as possible for people with poorer immune systems.</p>

        <p>Exactly. The vulnerable were <em>always</em> vulnerable. They were vulnerable to viruses and illness last year before this virus was discovered. No one did any of this, the world didn't shutdown to protect them, and they decided for themselves the risks they were comfortable taking to actually live and not just exist.</p>

        <p>They care about the societally agreed-upon problem.</p>
<p>Which really gets on my nerves. Because a number of us (a few of my friends since the beginning have had some sense) told everyone we knew that if we ignored the problems we were causing in the hopes of containment, we were going to cause a bigger disaster in the process.  </p>
<p>But tell that to the people who said "just stay home" and who are now saying "just wear a mask", and they'll call you selfish for your acknowledgement that there are other people in the world with other problems.  </p>
<p>Well, you know what, I guess I am selfish, and so are those other people, because damn it, they need to take care of themselves before they can take care of anyone else.</p>

        <p>It's always been this way. The "decent majority," as they style themselves, has never had any real empathy or compassion. That's why they spent so much time telling us about the empathy they felt for things, they thought that they could fake it until they made it.</p>
<p>Kindness is often not convenient or easy and it often takes more than most people are willing to give. Compassion means thinking beyond now and your own fears and at the common good. The mob can't do that. They recite the lines they've been given just like the NPCs that they have become. Social media took what was always a disturbing local phenomenon and made it a global connectedness of psychopaths lecturing others on what is right and wrong. </p>
<p>It's how they justify shitting on depressed people. It's how they justify rioting when they want and pretending that rioting is free of medical consequences in a pandemic. It's how they justify cancel culture and their extreme bullying of individuals - kind people don't insist on the destruction of someone's entire life for a few ill-judged words. And so on... these people are devoid of humanity and they always have been.</p>

        <p>Plus, the "support" and "awareness" was only for certain mental illnesses, like anxiety or depression.  I never saw anyone online advocate support and compassion for people with something like schizophrenia. God forbid you have a personality disorder. I have BPD and get treated like I'm subhuman for it.</p>

        <p>nah i disagree with that, lockdown (especially a second one) make you feel very hopeless so add joblessness, social isolation, lack of support systems etc to that and its an awful combo. Lockdown for many isnt the 'sit home and play video games' type deal like most of reddit seems to have.</p>

        <p>It's a terrible time for mental illness right now. I heard on the news that Zoloft prescriptions are way up because even people who have never experienced mental illness before are feeling depressed and anxious. It's even worse for a lot of people who already were struggling. People are scared of being sick, scared of being evicted from their homes, scared of not having enough food to eat, and then they have to sit home and marinade in those thoughts. It's a perfect storm for bad mental health.</p>

        <p>No one would do it for that small of a reason, however psychological features such as hopelessness (caused by the lockdowns that never seem to end, the media hammering home how life will never be 'normal', shifting goalposts making normal life seem unattainable)  increase their risk for suicide ideation/ thoughts. Factors such as unemployment/ losing a business or extended social isolation can be causes of depression and anxiety and increase ones risk of suicidal tendencies.</p>

        <p>Some people need more support than others. With that being said, we can't alter society based on the mental health needs of a few people, just like we can't at any other time. I have social anxiety disorder. Lockdown has been great for me personally. It's when lockdown isn't happening that I struggle with life. I have to work hard to manage it every day. I force myself to handle my own personal business on the phone because that's the only way some things can be handled. I have to go in person to the store or to class. I have failed classes before because I had panic attacks so severe I couldn't go, but that's my responsibility, not my teachers' or my school's. I have reached out for help and gotten it where it was offered, but ultimately it's up to me to do my best. It would be unreasonable for me to expect everyone to adapt everything around me and my needs. So I own my issue as much as I can, and I explain it and ask for help when I need it. There's no shame in asking for help or support because mental illness isn't something most people can handle completely on their own.</p>
<p>If people who are struggling with depression need help and support to get through lockdown, we should be doing our best to help them get support. The attitude shouldn't be, "Get over it, snowflake." Some people can cope but just need some therapy, some help finding outlets, someone to talk to, whatever it is that might help. But at the same time, if we as a society need to do something for the good of everyone (like a lockdown), then none of us should expect that the world halts what it has to do for our individual needs. As people with mental illness, we have to do our best to adapt, no matter how hard it is.</p>
