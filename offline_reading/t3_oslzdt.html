        <p>I filled that hole with simulation theory, and convinced myself that I might be God since I can't prove that anyone else has a consciousness or that this world wasn't created solely so I can experience it. </p>
<p>It sucks.</p>

<p>The problem with being smart is you can solve problems and understand things very easily. God and the universe can't be understood with our minds and its not supposed to be. God has secrets, the universe has secrets. We are just animals.</p>
<p>You've come to the conclusion that this is a simulation in your desperation to understand the world. The truth is we aren't supposed to understand everything and we are just along for the ride.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say I'm an intellectual, I hate reading. </p>
<p>But as for your last paragraph, yeah that's also possible. Religion and simulation theory could obviously be intertwined while our understanding of both could be completely wrong. I'm not suicidal, but I can't wait to find out what happens because I can't fathom the idea of "not existing" after death. I'm more inclined to believe in heaven/hell rather than ceasing to exist, even though I'm not religious in the traditional sense.</p>
