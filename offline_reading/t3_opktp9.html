    <strong>So over WFH. I feel like everyone saying they love it have just forgotten what real life is like.</strong>
    <p><p>How is that not supposed to be depressing? All of these people every day just leave their cameras off and I'm struggling to feel like any of it's real.</p>
<p>Like, what if it's just some big experiment to see how bummed out they can make someone. What the fuck? All of these people are vaccinated yet they're not making any of them go back to the office. Why the fuck is this company paying a lease if they're not making anyone come into the office, especially if literally all of these people are vaccinated?</p>
<p>It's so depressing, when does normal life come back? Who the fuck actually enjoys living at their office? I don't have an apartment anymore, it's an office. Love having my work/life balance be literally gone since my job is now in my f'in house.</p></p>

        <p>Hard disagree.</p>
<p>My profession going remote is the literal best thing to come out of the last year and a half for me, and it was overall a pretty good year and a half.</p>
<p>I will never go back to an office, period.  I'll take a pay cut if I have to but what a colossal waste of time offices have proven to be.</p>
<p>The only people in my industry that want to go back to the office are the useless parasites who don't make or produce anything and need to pad out their meeti g calendars to look useful.</p>

        <p>Working remote being the norm may have been the only good thing to come out of all this. I'd rather not have to put with the corporate culture bs and office politics if I'm able to do my job remote. Plus, it helps not having to commute and extra hour or 2 and squeeze in extra time to exercise, spend time with family, hobbies, etc. Don't get me wrong, whoever WANTS to go back to the office should be able to. I'd just rather work in the freedom of my own home and socialize when I want rather than insincere socialization that in person work brings. Besides, a lot of these companies are going woke and still requiring masks and distancing in person...that's a HARD no.</p>
