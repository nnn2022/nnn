        <p>They’ll say we need endless boosters.  Business is gonna be boomin’ for big pharma.</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.in/science/news/a-man-who-boosted-his-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-with-a-shot-from-moderna-said-his-side-effects-were-a-little-more-severe-the-third-time-round/articleshow/83671570.cms</p>
<p>"Oooh I got boosted!" he remembered bragging to family and friends afterwards, who were nonplussed about his unique booster shot experience. Perhaps they didn't realize that Hyser is one of the first Americans to participate in a groundbreaking COVID-19 mix-and-match study, aimed at assessing whether boosters work, and whether different COVID-19 shots are safe - and possibly more effective - when they're mixed together.</p>
<p>"With the booster, it was a little bit more severe," he said, describing waking up the day afterwards feeling "like I had done a very rigorous gym workout," with chills and arm soreness like he'd gotten a "hard punch in the shoulder." He popped some ibuprofen, which helped ease the aches, and by the following day, he felt like himself again.
"Given the dramatic impact that [the coronavirus] has had on the world, as a scientist, it's actually really heartening that these clinical trials are still going on and the secondary and tertiary questions are still being asked," Hyser said, estimating that he'll make about $600 total (compensation for his time) over the course of this study</p>

        <p>Injected with experimental mRNA serum apparently does not equate to vaccination.  Maybe there needs to be work on wording of these stories.</p>

        <p>This is interesting because this is the first time I have seen something where it would appear the efficacy of a vaccine is negative.  In other cases you may see people freaking about about how 1/3 of cases the delta variant are vaccinated, but in theory those could be biased from the fact that the delta variant is not as wide spread yet.</p>
<p>At this point the only argument would be if they went ahead and did stratified risk groups to explain why the people that got the vaccine were at much higher risk to begin with, and that would explain away the difference, but that would open up the argument to not vaccinating younger people because the adverse events might outweigh the benefit of the vaccine, and that argument would be absolutely detrimental to the revenue of Big Pharma, and therefore is an invalid argument.</p>
