    <p><p>I wish it weren't inevitable, but it really seems like it is. Everyone is just going along with it. "If I just stay inside...everything will go back to normal." "If I just wear a mask...they'll let me see my family." "If I just get this vaccine, I'll be able to keep my job", "If they just force all of these antivaxxers to get the jab, it'll be over"...If I, If I, If I....</p></p>

        <p>but smoking on planes obviously harms other people and is super gross and annoying at the very least, come on...</p>
<p>With COVID the "evidence" of benefits from wearing masks is specious to say the least, ESPECIALLY in regards to asymptomatic carriers. The masks are literally no different than <a href="https://youtu.be/wnBMwPcRbVE?t=20">Lisa's anti-Tiger rock</a></p>

        <p>My point was just that we think “obviously you shouldn’t smoke on planes or be able to fly to Mexico without a passport”, in the future people will think, “obviously you shouldn’t be able to just go anywhere without your health passport, Covid booster, and week long quarantine on both sides...flippantly disregarding these safety protocols obviously harms other people and is super gross and selfish at the very least”</p>
<p>That’s the direction we’re headed.</p>

        <p>Yep, being free was a crazy time! No one gave a shit who you were, you could buy a ticket the same day with cash (cash is what we called little slips of paper we could trade for goods &amp; services before 'cards' became mandatory) &amp; go anywhere! With only a State ID we could even go to Canada &amp; Mexico (&amp; the Caribbean). Too young for a Drivers License? No problem! Just come on in! I'd been to Canada &amp; Mexico before I could (legally) drive a car. </p>
<p>Won't be long &amp; no one will believe any of that! The very idea of leaving the house without 2 IDs &amp; a cel phone to track them, wearing 2 masks &amp; monthly 'update' shots will sound like science fiction.</p>

        <p>In the 70s and early 80s most people couldn’t afford to go on holiday. People in England went to seaside towns and this was the case in the early 1900s hundreds and probably well before. Travel will become a thing of the middle class and rich only. My mums parents, used to go on 3 holidays a year but my grandad earned good money. They went on a summer holiday with the kids, one on there own and to butlins. My grandad cleaned up Selifield reactor and plenty of others. It was his job. He was probably part of the Freemasons, my sister lives in an old freemason house. It’s got a Freemason stone sign in it, above the fire place and the house is from the 1800s. It’s a listed building.</p>

        <p>I've said this before too. The very concept of going to the grocery store at any time of the day without having to schedule an appointment as some countries are doing or having a set day to do so as others countries are doing. The idea I could items as much as I wanted without there possibly being a limit. Without having to wear a mask or some dystopian concept such as that in the future. All of it will fall on deaf ears and glazed eyes. Doubt they'll believe as the internet and history books will delete all traces of the world I lived in ever existing because I'm just a conspiracy theorist.</p>
