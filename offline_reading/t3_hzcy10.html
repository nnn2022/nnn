    <strong>I hate these people, nothing less.</strong>
    <p><p>Never have I been filled with so much rage and hate in my life. The politicians, the doomers, the idiots who question nothing, everyone who is allowing this nonsense to continue where I live, a place with no COVID cases at all, and especially the fearmongerers.</p>
<p>I’ve never hated anyone more. I hope bad things happen to them, I hope they get hurt. I hope their lives are completely ruined. I wish nothing but the worst on these people. I hope they feel the effects of what they’ve done until they day they die.</p>
<p>I will never forget who these people were as long as I live and I will never give them one ounce of respect again.</p></p>

        <p>I feel this way, too. I've felt a lot of anger and hatred boiling inside me since March, and it's only gotten worse. I especially feel it when I see my neighbors lately, wandering around their yard or the neighborhood masked up. Yesterday, I glanced out the window to see the neighbors' child relatives with masks on while in the pool, and it filled me with so much fucking rage. I get it, it's their lives, and if they want to wear masks, fine. But...they've been bullying people, including myself, into doing so as well. Nobody is allowed to wander out their homes without masks in my neighborhood. I often feel like a prisoner, and these people are the wardens. I mean, it's also like that as well in other parts of my state. Everyone is wearing masks, at all times. Even inside cars when alone. Or on bikes. Or on walks. And this is in the 90+ degree weather, and they don't seem bothered in the least, and even seem to be <strong>enjoying</strong> it.</p>
