    <strong>Leaving, relocating for freedom may not work. Hold your ground.</strong>
    <p><p>Get and share your support among others whose will is focused against this tyranny and the heads of this snake. Work on your determination..</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no free countries in the world now to go to. They have filled the whole world with their proxies, funded with their minted money, through global loan sharks like world-bank and IMF.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They can now coerce any of those countries we consider free to go full Nazi, by just threatening to pull the monetary plug. If not, they'll simply ask other proxies to start war, embargo, sanctions etc..</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They have successfully couped us all. And world has become one giant cage.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All that is really left for us now is our will and our strong yearning for freedom, which they now try to prey upon constantly, through fear-mongering "news" from their so-called "leaders".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So, what can we do?!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Don't give in, never give up and hold your ground. What was rightfully yours, is not for the other to take.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Get and share your support among others whose will is foccussed against this tyranny and the heads of this snake. Work on your determination.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And last but not least, work on your health (Rule of thumb: Modern food, modern life and modern ways need modern medicines and modern cures).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If they cannot break our minds and dampen our spirits, whatever they do won't last much longer. The universe, it's entities and karma that favors us will come to our rescue. Time will tell, just as history has always been written. Stay strong.</p></p>
