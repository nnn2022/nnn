        <p>I know a few freemasons myself (and at one point I was toying with the idea of joining after a lovely chap I met on holiday invited me to his lodge for initiation) - the vast majority know nothing and don't do anything beyond going to lodge meetings and the odd  bit of charity work. One such gentleman is an industrial fridge fitter who seems to have been invited in to just fit fridges for restaraunt owners and the like at bargain prices. I always thought he had learning difficulties before he told me this, which then made me think many of the masons are being used as useful idiots for the top dogs/the greedy. (Hense why police, tattoo artists, judges, barristers, business owners etc. Are invited in).</p>
<p>The highest ranking freemason I know (ex barrister turned doctor) is the one who put me off joining. Not only is he the single most intelligent person I've ever known, he is also of the opinion that it's not just a boys club; he was invited into the red house (believe that was his terminology) thanks to his masters in theology (one of 2 masters and 2 doctorates). It's a different world running by different rules in there. Occult practises are gospel, tarot dictates a lot of their actions and rituals are business as usual.
He ended up leaving exactly because of his theological background - once the occult elements started 'working'/manifesting, it changed his view from athiest with an interest in religion, to a genuine, practising theologian. </p>
<p>Since leaving the masons, he's had some sincerely strange experiences (spiritual in nature) that should anyone else have told me I'd have disregarded immediately. He's an incredibly sober, stoic and academic character, think Stephen fry but half the size and 15 years younger; I trust him implicitly.</p>
<p>Long and the short of it is, just because you know one low ranking Mason doesn't mean you're privy to what they're really about (not just directed at you Burnhen my guy, this is a message to anyone with even a minimal to moderate interest in secret societies). I suggest doing some digging around the history of the masons, there are some fascinating topics, such as Masonic temples pre-dating the cities they're built in in the US (and also happen to have been built across the layline the great pyramids live on, one such temple I do believe exists in San Francisco). Then there is the symbology hidden throughout architecture (check out mason symbology then take a look at the Whitehouse or pentagon from a birds eye view for a brief example... beyond this Masonic symbolism appears in virtually every major government building, churches, business logos etc.). Beyond this, numerology is the next port of call for your investigations and understanding the masons. </p>
<p>All just food for thought for anyone interested in diving down the rabbit hole and waking up from the Truman show. If you're not interested or open to the idea that's also fine and dandy, you'll have a far easier time enjoying the matrix they've built for us anyway!</p>
<p>I'll go back to my tinfoil lined cave now.</p>

<p>i have friends like this, specifically one who is aware of what is going on with covid and vaccines and now wants to bring his child to church, he considered himself an antitheist before this all started. its strange how witnessing and rejecting the occult invigorates your spirituality.</p>

        <p>It truly is! I think knowing that the ruling class actively believe in a greater power (and in a sense a different reality) somewhat unshackles you from the concrete prison they built for us and called society.
Diving down the rabbit hole and simply observing the world and behaviours expressed around me made me see the world for what it truly is. Vapid automottons wondering aimlessly through a materialist paradise; glaring into their phones, driving flashy cars or squandering worthless paper for more designer labels. Ultimately, selling their humanity. It made me acknowledge my routes, and through meditation (and binaural beats) I've had some truly existential experiences (in my case I was athiest through school, then agnostic following my best friends death aged 24 up until recently) that prove to me beyond any doubt that what we think of as reality is but a fragment in the overall tapestry of the 'universe' (or creative consciousness?) </p>
<p>On the topic of my friend - I don't want to give too many details as I feel he's quite an identifiable individual. 
But effectively, when he left the masons he had a sort of mystical experience, the first and last he had. Baring in mind he was 30-something when this happened and has a clear history of mental health... 
He said he was laying in bed reading, the night he officially left the freemasons; when the patterns on the wallpaper in his bedroom started turning into eyes. He started hearing voices murmuring at him, cant remember exactly what they were saying but it was along the lines of 'we'll be watching'. Then, craziest of all, he felt a presence in the room and spotted an (to him) instantly recognisable demon (he named the demon and showed a depiction of him online but the name eludes me. Quite an grey alien looking face with a fat body) watching him from the doorway. Then as quickly as it started, it stopped.
This was the moment I think that he became 'religious'. He spent a year or so in a foreign monastery for some kind of spiritual refuge, where he continued to have peculiar experiences that he doesn't share with anyone. </p>
<p>I'm sure he's not given me the full story, nor will he ever I'm sure. Freemasons will often tell you to never trust a freemason... perhaps once a freemason always a freemason? I'm sure they can't expose you to the weirdness and let you walk unmonitored back into society to tell your crackpot tales...</p>

        <p>I've always been quite open minded since I had a peculiar, repeated paranormal experience as a child (600 yr old family home did <em>appear</em> to be haunted) though I brainwashed myself out of the belief mid teens. Recently however, the air feels different.
 I think you're right though, dont lie, steal or hurt others; live to serve others in some way and you're on the right path.</p>

        <p>Thank you, as you seem quite well-versed on this point, could you explain how that relates to the Olympics in any way significant enough to be a part of the ceremony?</p>
<p>Because no one could be so credulous as to accept that as the premise for why this is portrayed without the relevance being established.</p>

        <p>It's common for the host country to truly incorporate their culture/history/things they're known for into the opening ceremony.  The 2012 Olympics were in GB, where JK Rowling is from.    </p>
<p>My guess is Voldemort was chosen because of how identifiable he is as a character.  Without watching the entire thing and seeing how the entire ceremony and all the other phases of the ceremony play together, we could turn this into just about anything we want.  It's a millisecond long screenshot that is part of an hour long ordeal.</p>

        <p>So are you suggesting this ceremony was to showcase Voldemort casting a spell on nurses? I mean how is that any better optics than what it already is, a dark obviously evil figure controlling the nurses (and by extension, healthcare). I'm not sure where robots fit in with your Harry Potter theory but I think the imagery is more than enough to deduce a vision here that is not just "children's literature"</p>

        <p>Well it wasn’t just Voldemort, it was chitty chitty bang bang and another one that I can’t remember. As I am sure your are aware that Harry Potter is one of the most popular children’s books ever. So of course that the planners would want to showcase it in the most dramatic way possible. Not everything is a conspiracy choose your battles wisely. Do what Alex Jones would do. If you want to watch the opening ceremony for context, here it is

        <p>"Symbolism will be their downfall"</p>
<p>Other fun things to look for during the Olympic ceremonies (and the Superbowl Half Times while we're at it) include other occult symbols such as: the all seeing eye/eye symbolism, black/white patterns that are usually checkerboards but can also be stripes (representing "duality"), pillars usually in sets of two (representing the masonic two towers aka towers of babylon), sun or "shooting star" worship, and my personal favorite, the fire sacrifice. This one goes way back, but popular instances include Katy Perry's flame dress, the guy who was lit on fire during the Indiana Jones special, and Michael Jackson had a great show with a giant Earth balloon and hundreds of dancers dressed in red, orange, yellow and white dancing underneath it (giving the vision the world was on a burner). </p>
<p>Very cool symbolism from our "elites", very cool, very moral..</p>

        <p>THIS. And also remember that this was when Israel won and they celebrated Eurovision in Israel. Which is kind of a coincidence</p>
<p>Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but Eurovision usually NEVER has those big celebrities singing in the open ceremony. Specially american celebrities. This was something unexpected to have someone like Madonna singing there.</p>
<p>And as a curiosity, she sang so bad live that when they uploaded the video on Youtube they edited it so it sounded better, you can find videos of the live performance and she sounds like crap lol</p>

        <p>oh my god! I remember that one. it was disgusting.<br>
I'm not sure I go for 4th dimensional space lizards, but more and more I'm convinced that the people who 'run' the world are not the same kind of beings as we are.. like, not properly human..?<br>

        <p>Haven't you known any evil people? I have, and they were just like me but with worse childhoods, an ego problem, and a lack of empathy. That explains most elites' behaviour better than being non-human imho.</p>
<p>Edit: That said, I'll admit the evil people I've known look possessed when they let their guard down. Something terrifying deep in the eyes. I'm not religious, but I don't think it's impossible there's some sort of demonic possession or something like that going on in those who embrace it.</p>

        <p>It was to honor the NHS of the UK (health system) or something, and tied children's literature to it. There's a video of the analysis on youtube, even includes a character that looks like Boris in a hospital bed. 100% predictive programming.</p>

        <p>While we are in the weird section of nonewnormal, there are several theories for the mandela effect.</p>
<p>One is cern. They have a shiva statue outside and made a mandela affected goading video. </p>
<p>Another is that we are all of one divine mind. The consciousness that is behind your eyes is the same as the one behind all others.</p>
<p>For me the choice is easy. Between fearing some control system shenigans, or believing that we are all God and can manifest the reality that we focus on.</p>
<p>That's not to say that I don't believe in the malificent actors in this world. I just also believe that they hain power by inciting us to fear. They have no other power, but to use our own against us. </p>
<p>The mechanism for hoodoo/voodoo is to make the other person belive that they have been cursed and their body and mind will do the rest. (there is more to hoodoo than curses of course) </p>
<p>Your one pointed focus is important. Believe and focus on the world that you want to see. Know that you will be OK and that your will will be made manifest.</p>
<p>Opposition gives energy to the other side that you are opposing. They get to decide the terms of the argument, that you oppose. Police create hippies, hippies create police etc. Go a third way. Live exactly how you want to live and as a fee human you have a right to live. It is also harder for the opposition to predict your actions as they are personal to you, rather than in predictable, easily countered opposition to a narrow agenda.</p>
<p>That's the basics. Can provide much more if you want.</p>

        <p>It seems like a Sigil, though I don’t know enough about chaos magic but it seems like the elites use a lot of things symbolically in the way one would if they were practicing this kind of thing. Just an idea.</p>
<p>We can in my idea educate ourselves on this kind of practice and make protective Sigils and things against this dark kind. I know I may sound crazy lol but if you read up on it and then look around at the symbolism they use, you may notice.</p>

        <p>One conspiracy theory is that everything that is happening now was supposed to happen about 10 years ago. Back then the technology wasn't in place for the lockdowns. No door dash, no smart phones,  Netflix and YouTube were not what they are now. We had dial up internet. It was a lot easier to tune out of digital fearmongering.</p>
