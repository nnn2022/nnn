        <p>I'm not an expert, but I could have told you that months ago. The states that got crushed by the virus early on are now doing victory laps and banning everybody else from entry. They didn't beat Covid. Covid beat itself.</p>

        <p>Here's what I've seen:</p>
<p>I live in a very busy area with a combination of blue-collar and white-collar workers.  </p>
<p>Additionally, I live near enough to a highway that always has construction going on.</p>
<p>The world around me did not stop.  For the first couple of months, there were some precautions, but generally no masks.  </p>
<p>I went to the hospital multiple times (routine check-ups - the hospital area also houses our local medical park - figured now was a good enough time with particular specialists that weren't checking on respiratory issues).  The hospital was not ever, not once, still not filled to capacity. I got a decent parking space virtually every time.  </p>
<p>Masks there?  Sure.  I get it.  I'm not going to even argue that.  Made me uncomfortable, but I'm not going to take that fight to a doctor's office - and lines were short enough that I barely had to wait in the waiting room before going to an exam room where I was alone and wearing one was unnecessary until a doctor showed up.  And even then, they were loosey-goosey on it.  </p>
<p>Mask enforcement in most businesses by June - okay.  Still...no big upticks, no big drama, no big bumps in hospital occupancy.  </p>
<p>July?  Now here's where the mask mandate rolls in.  In my office, it was kind of a given that people with cubicles social-distanced.  So, it was pretty much understood that being the adults we are, we can handle not wearing masks since we all more or less DID the right things well before there was even a thing called Coronavirus to worry about.  </p>
<p>Suddenly it's like: but why?  Among us, we know maybe one person who's had CV.  </p>
<p>Now if you want to go out to eat?  Wear a mask at the door.  Roll in to your table.  Sit down, mask off.  Nobody bugs you nothing.  Just put it back on when you leave. </p>
<p>I've seen more people afflicted by allergies the past few months.  I've seen more people downed with the flu last winter.  </p>
<p>From a 40K level, I can tell why an "expert" might think precautions are necessary.</p>
<p>As a working stiff, I'd be damned if I could tell you why the "expert" is missing the forest for the trees.</p>

        <p>Well I've got it now and is sucks balls. I've been sick sense Sunday and pretty much bed bound sense Thursday. And I work 3 jobs so not something I really want to be doing right now as I'm always on the go. If I'm sick for another week, I'll die from irritation and anger. It really just felt like a shitty cold for 5 days. I still won't say we should shut down the world over it tho.</p>

        <p>It is being implemented in Florida. They're doing just enough to avoid excess mortality from overrun hospitals. Restrictions are applied and lifted at the local level. Things are stricter in Miami, looser in Jacksonville, and looser still in the country. The cities have mask mandates, but there is no statewide mandate. The state is pursuing a "flat curve" herd immunity path, and they're doing a damn fine job. They don't don't say the taboo words out  loud.</p>
