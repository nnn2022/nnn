    <strong>The best way I've found to operate today without allowing it to be normal please do read download if you feel necessary....</strong>
    <p><p>Edit:  autocorrected from downvote to download... there is no download, just me trying to share my tinfoil umbrella.</p>
<p>So I got a text message from a friend saying that they tested positive, I was obligated to share that with my boss who gave me essentially a two week vacation "just in case" . He said that I needed A negative covid test to get back to work,  but I didn't want to participate in contact tracing, or sticking margellen swabs up my nose. </p>
<p>What I found was there's a company called Abbott that sells an at-home test where you get your own results in 15 minutes. What I did was blew my nose into a sterile 3x3" gause pad, used their q-tip to collect the sample from the sterile pad, and then administered that sample per their directions. I didn't need to register my name or anything else with the database (as their directions mandate a video call and photo of your ID!) and I get a positive or negative test in the privacy of my own home. </p>
<p>The only reason I'm sharing this is because I recognize that there's many of us who don't want to participate in any of this at all but for one reason or another we maybe forced to, this is a way that I found that you can get a legitimate answer yes or no, without having to share any of your information with nefarious actors, or install tracking apps on your devices.</p>
<p>I'm compelled to say that I am in no way affiliated with Abbott this is just because of my personal situation that I found this company that I could do this thing that seem to get a legitimate result. Download me if you want I'm just trying to share positive experience on my end in this clown world.</p></p>

        <p>Like a pregnancy test this has one control strip and one test strip so I needed two pink lines or one pink line to give me a diagnosis. I like the cut of your jib but unfortunately it doesn't not sail in these winds.</p>

        <p>Curious why you think they wouldn't want "proof" beyond my "word"...</p>
<p>Edit: beyond that I don't want to be an asshole liar. If I have covid why the fuck would I go back to work if I can have a free three or four week vacation? Now I'm going to take that fucking test and if I have it I'm going to stay home and if I don't I'm going to go back to work because I'm not liberal. I earn my money, I don't collect it.</p>

        <p>Abbott is a rapid antigen test yes? Lateral flow test that has been using the PCR test as a measure of how accurate it is if im not wrong.</p>
