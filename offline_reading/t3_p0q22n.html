    <p><p>"No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings." (Translation: Vaccine manufacturers can't be sued even if you prove you got side effects from it as long as they didn't mess up the actual injection.)</p>
<p>"No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, solely due to the manufacturer’s failure to provide direct warnings to the injured party (or the injured party’s legal representative) of the potential dangers resulting from the administration of the vaccine manufactured by the manufacturer" (translation: You can't sue vaccine manufacturers because they didn't give you proper warnings about side effects.)</p>
