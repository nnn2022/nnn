    <strong>Canada’s lockdowns nearly as strict as communist China, Cuba: Oxford University</strong>
    <p><p>Comrade Justin Castro approves this study..</p>
<p>Canada’s current lockdown measures are some of the <a href="https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/stringency-map">most stringent</a> in the world rivalling authoritarian communist states like China and Cuba, Oxford University’s COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) suggests. </p>
<p>Included in the tracker is a COVID-19 stringency index which measures the strictness of government protocols meant to handle the pandemic. </p>
<p>The score is based on nine variables including school closures, travel bans and other public health measures. Each country is given a value from 0 to 100 by the index, with the score of 100 indicating the strictest policies. </p>
<p>“The project tracks governments’ policies and interventions across a standardized series of indicators and creates a suite of composites indices to measure the extent of these responses. Data is collected and updated in real time by a team of over one hundred Oxford students, alumni and staff, and project partners,” reads a <a href="https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2021-03/BSG-WP-2020-032-v11.pdf">research report</a> on the project. </p>
<p>As of May 3, 2021 Canada had a stringency score of 75.46 which is driven by school and workplace closures, gathering restrictions, stay at home orders and other measures. </p>
<p>In comparison, the severity of China’s lockdown measures only surpasses Canada’s by a few points, with the communist state having a stringency score of 78.24. </p>
