        <p>A "death for any reason within 28 days of testing positive for covid 19" seems almost deliberately broad and designed to pump up the numbers.</p>
<p>But I got called a tin foil hat lunatic for saying this early on. It's fucking bound to be inflated, given those criteria.</p>

        <p>The entire thing is a scam - the tests are fake, "covid" is a marketing ploy for fascist vaccine passports.</p>

        <p>I spent a few days talking with someone who claimed to be a UK doctor, and I have no reason to doubt him.  He said he's quite comfortable diagnosing deaths due to covid, even without a test, because the symptoms are so distinct.  Patients with cancer, organ failure, whatever, will have that noted as well, but citing cause of disease as covid is no different than flu in the past.</p>
<p>So he was very much annoyed/offended/something when I made claims about elevated death statistics, because he sees this portion of the job as straightforward.</p>
<p>What's odd, and he apparently did not know, is the UK criteria for a death are separate, the "x days since a positive PCR test."  To be clear, assuming this user is being honest, this is NOT the criteria the doctors themselves are using.</p>
<p>So it seems the UK government (and this seems to apply in the US in most states as well) is literally using different criteria than the doctors to determine a covid death.  They're not looking at death certificates, they're reaching their counts independently.  Which is astounding.</p>
<p>(Or the guy is lying, I obviously have no way to know for certain.)</p>
