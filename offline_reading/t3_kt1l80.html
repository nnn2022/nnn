    <strong>Currently on senior year in high school, can't find any motivation despite my biggest efforts to be mentally strong.</strong>
    <p><p>What else can I say that hasn't been mentioned in this sub at this point? I just want to share my experience.</p>
<p>I'm 18, on my last year of HS. It's tough to concentrate as my school adopted hybrid learning (half of the days I stay at home, the other half at school), which I first thought wouldn't be <em>that</em> bad but I was proved wrong, 4 months later. </p>
<p>I feel it's unfair to evaluate us under these conditions. My teacher's aren't being any less demanding and I feel so burnt out, and I've always been the kind of student to take things positively and get good grades no matter what.</p>
<p>The days I attend school I feel suffocated with a mask on for 6 hours, plus we gotta have the windows open 24/7 "for security" and I'm right next to one, freezing for the whole session. We disinfect like maniacs and the chairs and tables end up sticky and damp. </p>
<p>The days I stay home it gets worse, I can't bring myself to focus on a screen at my desk for long before getting distracted and engaging in some other activity. Not to mention the Meet calls are laggy AF and we often have audio problems.</p>
<p>If all these inconvenients weren't enough, this year I'm taking something similar to the SAT in my country and I just can't think of how will I manage to pass that with a good mark seeing the conditions I have to deal with during this school year.</p>
<p>I can't stress enough how much I want this to be over and go back to the normality we had prior to the plandemic.</p></p>

        <p>Same here, except I work from home. All motivation is lost since there's no perspective anymore. Trying to 'be positive' and 'reward yourself more often' is only temporary and an insult to my mind.</p>

        <p>Just find solace in the fact that some 97 year old got to live another two weeks. /s</p>
<p>But seriously you're the ones I feel really sorry for.</p>

        <p>It's totally selfish and unfair to do this to young people. I think you should get organised. Plan to do something exciting as soon as you've passed, which you will. Empower yourself. As an 18 year-old I wish I'd known that I could do what I wanted and largely succeed if I was focused. My parents were obsessed with education. I ended up at university and perhaps you should too if it suits you, but if I had kids I'd tell them to get work experience and to focus on having fun and working. I know it seems like everything's against you, but at 18 you are perfectly able to succeed and make your own judgements.</p>

        <p>This comment resonates so much with me. Iâ€™m in my second last year of high school and I hate it here. Having the windows open is the worst part, and IDK what they put in the disinfectant at my school but itâ€™s disgusting. Please stay strong. More people our age are hopefully waking up.</p>

        <p>It's always great to see someone else my age can see past the awful situation we're stuck in and think independently :) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, (at least my mates) younger people seem to be very compliant and show little to no skepticism in their way of speaking and acting.</p>
<p>Stay strong pal, best wishes</p>
