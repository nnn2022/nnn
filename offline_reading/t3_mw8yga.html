    <strong>I feel helpless</strong>
    <p><p>I feel helpless to everything going on in the world.  </p>
<p>Helpless that I live in a Democratic state that still doesn't even have plans to roll back the restrictions. Helpless and angry that my family has been to afraid to go out now. That they have fallen victim to the fearmongering the CDC and the government has done. I feel like I am the only one in my family seeing through all of this bullshit. Especially since I had Covid and recovered from it mind you. Same goes for half of my family who got it, recovered from it and yet they are still scared!  </p>
<p>I mean good lord it's just common sense. If you caught something and recovered how is it you're still vulnerable? That alone proves you are fine to go out and do whatever you want. Also the huge thing I don't understand is people having issue with those without a mask. If you are that fucking scared why are you out?! Shouldn't you be at home?! Why go to a store or a mall if you're worried. I mean really why does everyone else have to suffer because YOU ARE SCARED. Just because you saw or heard someone else die from Covid doesn't mean that's going to happen to you too!   </p>
<p>For the folks who say to mask up I ask you this. Since masking up does prevent the spread according to you and your "lord and savior" Fraudci, shouldn't we just not breathe then? I mean you can't spread the virus if you aren't breathing. If the government said they had to take drastic measures to reduce the population because there is still a rise in cases even with the vaccine. I bet you wouldn't say you are on board with it now. I bet you would call me crazy. Yet whose to say if they show some crazy high infection number you would be on board with it then. I mean that is what is really scary and concerning. People would think logically that by getting rid of a huge chunk of the population the virus would go away or "have a really low infection rate" according to Fraudci.</p></p>

        <p>I didn't take any. I just rested at home and was over it within a week. Thing is I didn't even experience one of the worst or obvious symptoms. No Coughing, No Fever, No loss in taste or Smell. Just a stuffy nose that felt like a cold. It wasn't until a week after that when I was feeling better someone in my house got sick with the sniffles. They got paranoid and went to see if they were positive which they were. However, by the time I got my test which was a couple of weeks after I recovered from my sniffles I tested Negative.</p>

        <p>Try Wim Hoff Breathing Technique. Watch School of life, guy has some good tips on how to deal with life. Also watch the Ted talk Change your breath, change your life by Lucas Rockwood. Do pushups. Practice shadow boxing. Do skipping ropes but without the ropes, keep jumping 100 times. </p>
<p>I don't know what you are dealing with and I don't know what you are going through. But for every problem there is a solution and there is always hope. </p>
