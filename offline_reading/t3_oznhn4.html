    <strong>Covid religion</strong>
    <p><p>Just an observation I've had for a while, wherever you line up on covid and the vax, it's odd to me how the "science" has been turned into a faith and trust based religion. Science is a process to find truth that's why it's a process. It is ment to be challenged and debated within the parameters of the scientific process. We can also observe the lead spokesman (preacher) of the religion, Fauci preach for benefit of the religions gain and the fanatic followers who turn a blind eye to reason and critical thought, and of course science as it's definition. This post is not to discredit the idea of religion as religion is based upon faith rather the notion that a group of people are using a perverse idea of science as the foundation of their religion. Seems like an oxymoron. Why has science become the opposite of what it's supposed to be in culture today? Why should we listen when we hear leaders say "trust or believe the science" when it's meant to be proven not faith based?</p></p>

        <p>Murray Rothbard predicted this happening ~40 years ago. </p>
<p>Historically, people were controlled by religion and religious heads, just think of the Catholic church. A thousand years ago, people's lives were dictated to them by the church, their reasonings behind it being it was in the bible, while these people weren't allowed access to the bible, they had no way to prove or disprove it. They were kept ignorant, accused of blasphemy if they questioned the status quo, told to shut up and trust the pope. Religion was politicized. </p>
<p>Recently, atheism has become more prevalent seeing as we've evolved scientifically. That's not lost on "authority". Now we are seeing a repeat of religion being used to control the masses, but this time it's being called "science". You can't question it, otherwise you're a "science denier", modern day blasphemer. We have no access to any of their "evidence" and are told to blindly trust "the experts". Science has become politicized. </p>
<p>It's nothing but an old tactic, shaped for the modern era, that is tested and true in holding the masses.</p>

        <p>And what's sad is science is our process for finding truth through a method of discussion, controversy and trial. The very idea that truth could be found threatens their ideology and therefore must be silenced. People need to stand up for truth, for the scientific method, for what we believe in. Without that we will be controlled by this new cult behavior.</p>

        <p>Your post reminds me of a video I watched last name with Dave Rubin having a discussion with a rabbi and a bishop. They mentioned that people have filled in religious worship with government worship. Religious leaders make more fucking sense today than your typical politician. It's all about body, mind, and soul, but people feed their soul to the government in order to have answers.</p>

        <p>Yeah, makes sense. God designed us to worship. As humans we make idols for ourselves in spite of Him. Government can absolutely be idolatry for people. This explains why they have such disdain towards those who don't worship their false gods of covid and government along with them. Sounds like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and the fiery furnace. Just a couple more steps ahead.</p>
