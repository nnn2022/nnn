    <strong>What do you think about the state? I invite you to Libertarianism.</strong>
    <p><p>The state does not have the right to interfere with what people wear, it has no right to manipulate people, it should not interfere in what they do or not do, and it should not make decisions on behalf of the individual. Everyone should be free. Everyone should have the right to think what they want. Most importantly, the state has no right to interfere with people's bodies.</p>
<p>Democracy is nothing without a republic. Democracy is two wolves and a sheep deciding what to have for dinner. He who deceives the majority makes all kinds of tyranny against the few. Therefore, the average person thinks that <em>democracy "can be legitimate only as long as fundamental rights and freedoms are protected from all kinds of tyranny."</em> <strong>So what happened to that average person?</strong></p>
<p>These are sufficient arguments for you to understand that the current state system is terrible. America, the most perfect constitutional republic, has reached this point in 250 years. Other countries are much worse. So what will you do? Will you rebuild the same thing when it's demolished? I can guarantee that it will be demolished again after similar time. Maybe some of you will be fatalistic. You will think that this is the law of nature/god. <strong>No this is not true.</strong> The better a system is, the longer it will last. So what system is better than the current system?</p>
<p>I've always heard this from my environment as an excuse. <em>"Democracy is bad, but there is no better."</em> Well, have you ever checked to see if there is another system that fits your worldview? No you didn't.</p>
<p>America was founded on libertarian foundations. But it is clear that libertarianism is not enough. Isn't there a system that provides more freedom? Isn't there a system that provides more wealth, privacy, justice, happiness and permanence? It's a system that can better protect property (even my body looks state-owned in the current state) and not easily degenerate.</p>
<p>Libertarianism has developed a lot over the last 100 years. The problems are well analyzed. And solutions were found. It's a pity that people don't pay attention. But after all, there are 106k people even in r/NoNewNormal, right? You guys here are in a very select minority. I hope you don't settle for that. And investigate further.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You see big corporations supporting tyranny by collaborating with the state. Does that mean more capitalism isn't good? No. It is possible for companies to oppress people only under a state. The free market is the biggest obstacle to tyranny and <a href="https://mises.org/wire/why-there-no-such-thing-exploitative-monopoly-free-market">Monopoly are not possible in the free market.</a></p>
<p>I know it sounds weird the first time it's said. <strong>But here is The Red Pill:</strong></p>
<p>All kinds of services, such as the police, the court, the army, and road construction, can be done by private companies better, inexpensive and more morally correct than the state.</p>
<p>In terms of your perception, I can say that this is a kind of micro-federation structure. Individuals get the laws they want through compromises. And no one's fundamental rights can be violated.</p>
<p>Who developed libertarianism? <strong>And who makes</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism"><strong>Anarcho-Capitalism</strong></a> <strong>possible?</strong> Carl Menger, Ludwig Von Mises, nobel economists(Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman), <strong>David Friedman(son) and of course Murray Rothbard</strong></p>
<p>Its roots are even deeper. It goes back to individualist anarchists.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you at r/Anarcho_Capitalism.</p></p>

        <p>A friend of mine said that he’s libertarian and supports businesses not allowing people in without vaccine papers. He said everyone who is able to get the shot(s) should have to. Like… that’s the opposite of libertarian you brain dead slug</p>
