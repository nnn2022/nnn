        <p><strong>Table 3</strong></p>
<p>&rt;For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 4.0 additional conditions or causes per death.</p>
<p><em>so 94% of Covid deaths were people who had 4 comorbidities</em></p>
<p>And this is why mental health is a much larger issue for people under 25 than Covid ever will be. More people &lt;25 have committed suicide than died of Covid...</p>

<p>October 2020 had more suicides in Japan than all Covid deaths in 2020 there:</p>

        <p><strong>The government hasn't mandated vaccine passports because they can't.</strong> That would be against ADA Law and the 14th Amendment, which is why only private businesses (where you need a membership) can implement these policies.</p>
<p>The EEOC has declared Covid-19 a "direct threat" so employers could test for infection, but lack of immunity is not a direct threat and thus is covered under ADA Law. You would need to be given "equal access" or "reasonable accommodations" for a "public establishment". <em>The Vaccine Passport Rollout has enacted ADA Law and it applies to all public businesses with public access like the mall, or walmart, or a grocery store.</em></p>
<p>If we continue down this trail of following <em>for-profit</em> MSM propoganda then it will be established that the vaccine has enabled herd immunity, in which case it will be brought up that vaccine passports should be implemented. Stop being a labrat or enjoy the complete evaporation of liberties.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong> it's a clinical trial, so obviously long term effects are unknown. The industry's vaccine being pushed (Pfizer) is one of, if not the most,  criminal habitual offender in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Be on the ready if any public business tries to ask about vaccinations</strong></p>
<p>https://www.ada.gov/criminaljustice/cj_complaint.html</p>
<p>The definiton of "disabled" is even more vague than you may imagine. </p>
<p>https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/notice-concerning-americans-disabilities-act-ada-amendments-act-2008</p>
<p>&rt;The Act retains the ADA's basic definition of "disability" as an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities</p>
<p>For DCVPs <em>(Digital Certificate Vaccine Passports):</em></p>
<p><em>(imo)</em> Therefore, if you are NOT able to access an establishment due to a vaccine passport, then you are "DISabled" from free access and equal opportunity, which is illegal. Same as if an establishment had stairs leading to the only entrance without wheelchair accessibility.</p>
<p>14th Amendment, Section 1 (cutout):</p>
<p>&rt;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws</p>
<p><strong>You can say this is false, but medical establishments have been discussing this for months:</strong></p>
<p>https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/vaccine-credentials-how-make-sure-they-re-done-right?keyword=immunization%20passport</p>
<p>https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/key-questions-about-covid-19-vaccine-passports-and-the-u-s/</p>
<p><strong>ALSO you are not required to disclose the clinical trials you have taken part in, which is literally what Covid "vaccine" is... so no matter what way you look at it, it's all BS</strong></p>

        <p>My fault, somehow it sent me to the Provisional CDC data:
 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm</p>
<p>(Figured out I had already DL that pdf and had the Provisional page open for whatever reason)</p>
<p>My argument to masks is the same principal, because arguing specifics within a fantasy is still a fantasy. </p>
<p>It's illegal because it's an expetimental treatment not proven by any science <em>(as studies of masked surgeons have depreciated blood oxygen saturation in surgical rooms aka oxygen enriched environments),</em> and even smart masks coming out inform you when C02 levels are too high so you can remove your mask and get a fresh breath of air. It's all BS. </p>
<p>CDC also released a paper detailing how completely useless cloth masks, neck warmers, and face shields were. I also would like to mention completely ignoring every other form of PPE <em>(if they actually cared about protection)</em> as if a virus can't enter through the eye, or skin contact. "You must wear a mask, but please use the same utensils and desks as the previous 5 dozen children before you." Avoiding proper mask guidelines results in dirty masks being worn, spit laden masks handled by bare hands.</p>

        <p>Are any of the measurements done after the masks are damp? Many previous studies showed loss of whatever effectiveness there was after about half an hour</p>
<p>These only run a few rounds that dont  replicate real world scenerios. 
The original Lindsley https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/10/07/2020.10.05.20207241.full.pdf   which is slide 7 of your link. 
On page 13 of the study a realistic use scenerio for the children? Print that pic and show them what a test is. </p>
<p>Look at the graph for the Lindsley on pg 14 of their original document that the CDC chose to omit. The error bars of the 'no mask' and 'cloth' in the most 'deadly' size 0.6 micron. There is zero proof that cloth masks are improving condition in that catagory, and a very small amount that they are in surgical masks</p>
<p>They may have choosen those diameters intentionaly to muddy the water around the  1micron size, as the next catagory up expands to 1.1 micron. </p>
<p>I'll add more later if i have time</p>

        <p>I've been using the Lockdown Sceptics website as a regular source. It seems to be collating most of the the available data, amongst many other things. Here's a link to their search result for "mask effectiveness" https://lockdownsceptics.org/?s=Mask+effectiveness
I've gone through a number of these myself and there's some fascinating reading there, both scientific and expert written explanation for the lay person.</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge there has only been one random controlled trial for mask effectiveness re SARS Cov2. This was done in Denmark and released back end of last year. The conclusion was that masks do as near as nothing to protect anyone, however that tiny chance of something, maybe, possibly, has allowed the "fact checkers" to "fact check" it. But every trial or study ever done for masks for respiratory diseases has drawn a blank and with the flu pathogen being larger than the SARS Cov2 pathogen, if masks don't stop flu they won't the cov.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>
