        <p>I only find hope in Jesus, if I didn't have an eternal perspective I would've gone kamikaze long ago. </p>
<p>I'm still infuriated by the draconian restrictions in place, I'm seeing them affect my wife's mental health and it makes me rage inside. But what more can I do besides rely on my faith in Christ? The Bible always told this story. Cain killed Abel. The Jews killed Jesus. Bad people kill good people etc.</p>
<p>What keeps me going is believing there is an ultimate day of reckoning coming for all the unjust, and that I/we can escape it by believing the Gospel. Until then, I already knew this is how the world works. There is nothing new under the sun.</p>

        <p>https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210408-obligatory-jabs-necessary-in-democratic-society-europe-rights-court    </p>
<p>-----   </p>
<p>while I was a little relieved when I read about how the WHO was speaking out against vaccine passports lately recognising its potential for being used as tool for discrimination  </p>
<p>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-who-vaccines-idUSKBN2BT158   </p>
<p>( ... I have noticed the ... for now ... clause, possible that they might switch their stance once the pharmaindustry has ramped up production to have hundreds of millions of vaccine doses in storage ... )   </p>
<p>this decision of the european rights court is a serious setback for everyone who was  and is advocating body autonomy awareness    </p>
<p>but then ... the very nature of a court is highly problematic as ...   </p>
<p>who is electing these judges ... its the politicians who are highly connected to the big economy    </p>
<p>while it is very sad to witness this moment when courts sell out to a global concerted initiative taking away the individual personal sovereignty of every human being ...   </p>
<p>regarding what one wants to eat, drink or otherwise ingest/take in/inject into ones body  the sollution for this situation is most simple:   </p>
<p>to dissolve this megastructure what allows a few individual human beings to decide what is right or wrong for several hundred million human beings, to dissolve the political hierarchies in a most consequential manner    </p>
<p>so that we may arrive at the moment, where we who live together as each others neighbours will be able to come together at all times in the circle of all children, youth and adult human beings, all who live here and now permanently, everyone with the very same weighted political voting power ... to create, maintain and interpret the law what is valid on the territory of the local community    </p>
<p>so that we who live together as neighbours will be able to come together to decide what is right and what is wrong within our neighbourhood    </p>
<p>but how could we possibly get there  how could we shift all political decision powers towards the local sovereign community    </p>
<p>how could we detach our local communities from all the superficial artificial overhead called regional states, nation state, international law frameworks   </p>
<p>I see a most elegant way to do so in renewing our very basic contract, the most fundamental agreement we human beings know for setting up the way we function as a society:   </p>
<p>renewing the constitution of the regional state and the nation state possibly using concepts like:   </p>
<p>---   </p>
<p>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state    </p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level   </p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents   </p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state   </p>
<p>---   </p>
<p>as I understand it ... we still live in a framework what comes from the feudalistic structure ... the king chooses feudal families which choose the rules for the villages/towns/cities they are given ownership by the king ( ... the assumption there being that the king would be chosen by god to own all the land and would have the god given power to decide who can use it for what purpose ... )  </p>
<p>today ... the king is being replaced by the nation state what is represented by the national parliamentary assembly ... a few hundred people elected to make the rules, the law for their fellow millions of human beings and the feudal families are being replaced with the regional states represented by the regional parliamentary assembly ... also some hundreds or less ... elected people who make the rules, the laws what are still open for interpretation after the national parliamentary assembly has set the framework </p>
<p>and at the bottom are as allways the villages, the towns, the cities ... the local communities which have the smallest part of the law which they are allowed to decide upon    </p>
<p>by simply dissolving this hierarchy and shifting all political powers to the local community ... by dissolving both the national parliamentary assembly and the regional parliamentary assembly so that only the full assembly of all local residents of a local community remains as the only place where the law is made  </p>
<p>the circle of all who are each others neighbours ... create the laws what are valid in this neighbourhood  </p>
<p>it is so simple  </p>
<p>the moment we choose someone else to make the law for us ... we are fucked   </p>
<p>the moment we say ... no more representatives no more ... no more electing other people to make the law ... now we want to create the law what we are willing to live with in the circle of all human beings who live here and now as permanent residents   </p>
<p>from this moment onwards we unfuck ourselves but engage in respectfull dialog looking each other in the eyes at the same level knowing that this here and now, this meeting of all who are concerned about a topic, all who are living here in this local community as permanent residents are able to vote on what we are going to do to solve it... how are we going to live with each other on a daily basis so that everyones needs are covered and everyone is free to do as one feels it being suitable</p>

        <p>this is my hope ... that we human beings do some basic analysis what went wrong since the roman empire started to dominate europe ...   </p>
<p>the empire still is alive today, just a little better concealed</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>it is up to us to prepare this future where we stop electing people to represent us but start deciding in the  circle of equals</p>
