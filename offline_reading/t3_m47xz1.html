        <p>Several people in my immediately family had it (we think it was Covid, positive antibody tests confirmed it) and one of them is an 80+ year old senior with heart issues, bedrest for a week and now back on their feet and cooking/cleaning like it was nothing. My dad, two days of a sore throat and that was it.... yes we literally locked down the globe for this, insanity</p>

        <p>I know a few 80+ guys who pulled the plug on their ventilators. Granted they were heavy smokers and above the average life expectancy. Still have yet to meet anyone 79 or below that had more than flu like symptoms. Not trying to make a case here just what ive experienced over the year</p>

        <p>I've had it. I slept for an entire week and it felt like I had a slight head cold.</p>
<p>Also, most of my friends have had it and my family including my 95 year old g'ma and my Dad who has Type 2 diabetes and COPD.</p>

        <p>well, like my dad said he felt really bad, ("the worst sickness of my life") but he also had a nasty foot infection which i'm sure played a large role. he used to not wear a mask, but he does now because he says he doesnt want anyone to feel that bad.</p>

        <p>I went to a bull riding show back in July with my ex fiancé (we lived together) she came down with a pretty sore throat a week after and chills, after getting tested she confirmed she had covid. We slept together ate after each other, kissed, sex, you name it. I NEVER contracted it. Tests- negative.... antibody test - negative. I just don’t understand how the country is shit down for this INSANELY contagious disease but I still haven’t gotten it. </p>
<p>I don’t mask up, I travel frequently (my new gf I met while on a trip to Georgia in December) </p>
<p>I go to bars, I eat out, went to medieval times recently (if you’ve never been it’s fucking epic do yourself a favor)</p>

        <p>My family had it before we knew we were supposed to be scared. No one died then but after like a year is when we started hearing about people we know dying from it. I think most of the adverse effects come from anxiety, prolonged wearing of masks and getting treated in the hospital.</p>

        <p>Good news, they’ll have antibodies. My colleague got hers retested and a year later antibody titer is still up. So as far as I know antibodies last at least a year but knowing immunology those things should last for decades. For example the antibodies made from the MMR vaccine are constantly made for life.</p>

        <p>Back in October to November of 2019 I had a 5week cough;feeling like phlegm that wouldn’t come up. I’ve had my nose cauterized 3x for nose bleeds so send of smell is not a sign for me. I have aches,pain etc from my job and waking up so early so I couldn’t tell from that aspect. 
I’ve got all the bad things they say to beware of if you have Covid. 
Heart attack,diabetes. High blood pressure and cholesterol issues. 
I coughed and coughed for weeks. Was I scared? Never it was a cough. My remedy was whiskey, cold meds. Still here. Still breathing fine</p>

        <p>Gentleman that isn’t how statistics work.   Everybody you know could get COVID and be fine and it wouldn’t change the statistics.  </p>
<p>But that’s the point, they read the statistics and think Emergency Lockdowns.  I read the same exact statistics and call it Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The deaths and hospitalizations are inconsequential in the greater scheme.</p>

        <p>Me and my family had it too and it was like a flu. Even my grandparents (both are 80+) had it and survived, despite they are far from being healthy - my grandma is a chain smoker with diabetes and grandfather has walking problems and had cancer few years ago. What's funny, my grandma didn't have any symptoms. However my grandfather was sent to the hospital for 2 days due to high temperature. Anyway, we're fine right now and we can tell that coronavirus is not as dangerous as the media is says it is.</p>

        <p>One of my best friends got covid from her sister and she only got a bad case of the common cold (symptom-wise) and her sister had nothing happen to her. She is an athlete but her sister is not. It's all bullshit. Lock away vulnerable people and the sick, not healthy people.</p>

        <p>What do I tell the people that have had a death in the family from covid? Or who have friends with deaths in the family? What do I tell the old man that came up to me, the only one around not wearing a mask in the grocery store, to tell me about his wife who was just in the hospital for the 2nd time, 1st time being from covid? </p>
<p>Cause I can't call them losers for being empathetic.</p>
