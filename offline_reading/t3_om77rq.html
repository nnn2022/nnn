    <strong>To pro-vaxxers;</strong>
    <p><p>Edit; ...I have no idea where the picture of the bear came from. I didn't add any links with it in there either. Very odd.</p>
<p>To pro-vaxxers and anyone who supports the mandate of vaccine passports/passes;</p>
<p>What do we have to gain by perpetuating not getting vaccinated? </p>
<p>All of us have lost our jobs, our time, $68 trillion, memories we could have made but never got to, some of us friends and/or family. Now the unvaccinated are receiving death threats, passively or not, being alienated, being  censored both on social media and by MSM, and comprise a minority. What exactly do we have to gain here? I am speaking to you from one human being to another, because to perpetuate the dehumanization of either group is both irresponsible and indecent. </p>
<ul>
<li>It's not money, because in a lot of places now you can't work unless you show proof of vaccination </li>
<li>It's not friends, in-person or offline because a lot of us have had ties cut over this matter. In America, we make up less than 33% of people, and I know all  33% of us aren't on the internet either (referring to the Black/POC communities here who already live in poverty/have limited internet  access)</li>
<li>It's not fame nor glory, if anything we are actively being dehumanized for "refusing" or  even being remotely skeptical of the vaccine</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do we have to gain here? Why would we willingly torture ourselves in this way if there weren't a good enough reason? Could it be possible, that we have questions and skepticism that has been  ignored, unanswered, unapproved, and rejected entirely?</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Scientific Revolution began with a question. The Scientific Method  itself was created as a means to analyze the world around us using  statistics, data, and evidence in an objective manner. In doing so, we had an avenue of understanding the world that was based on numbers and facts, not delusions or lies produced from organizations like the Church. It does not guarantee for absolutes, but it does make statistical and evidence-based predictions based on what is currently known and what claims have currently withstood the test of various experiments and criticisms. This is what differentiates claims from hypotheses all the way up to theories and laws.</p>
<p>Within these last 6 months, an active and open discussion about the implication, efficacy, and both pros and cons of the vaccines has not been permitted. Anyone skeptical of the vaccines gets people censored and/or labeled as a grandma killer, and rather than having questions answered, has been met  with a range of answers varying from "just get it bro" to "I have no sympathy for you if you die, plague rat", to McDonald's, the perfect picture of all that is healthy, strongly recommending it, even outright forcing I get it depending on the workplace.</p>
<p>What is also troubling is the people who got vaccinated themselves, or the families of those injured who try to report on not just VAERs but as well as other platforms, have been essentially silenced and are not being allowed to speak their side of the story.  Their videos have been removed from YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter etc. and have been cited as "misinformation."</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>Censoring any and all dissenting opinions <strong>directly contradicts</strong> what the purpose of the Scientific Method aimed to achieve. It is in and of itself an unscientific practice and would be considered intentional manipulation of data.</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>This vaccine has only been used for around 6 months. 6 months is not representative of long-term data, and it has alarmed some of us that long, withstanding medical doctors in the community are saying there is a potential risk for developing blood-clotting, myocarditis, stroke, and death related to vaccine injury. Short-term data does not paint a full picture when it comes to safety for usage. It only shows that in the short-term, a number of people have not been hospitalized for COVID. It does not ensure that in the long-term, you will 100% not develop the few of many reported vaccine injuries listed above.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>When asking why the reactions are happening, we are met with lies and are instead bullied for not trusting the vaccine. The CDC at one point has told us that the vaccine will prevent you from  getting COVID with a pretty high certainty, upwards of 98%+. Now we are being told that not only was this not true, but that the vaccinated can also transfer COVID as well as contract it.</p>
<p>Public perception of it now makes it seem like a flu shot, as per the supposed reason for boosters.  If this is the case, why are vaccines being pushed as hard as they are?  If the CDC cannot remain consistent, what is the issue? It it perhaps time? If that is the case, you cannot mandate vaccines in good conscience then, because there are still unknowns that need to be ironed out until a more consistent picture is readily available to be discussed, backed by data. </p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Is it perhaps a narrative being pushed? What are the odds of this actually occurring? Remember, we, the unvaccinated and skeptical, are currently  being silenced and banned by MSM and SM. This again is not allowing for an open and unbiased discussion on why these issues are occuring.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>We were also told that 2 shots and you're done, we are out of the hole and  can return to normal. We were told to get 2 to do your part. Nope. Now  we need booster shots, masks, and lockdowns for Delta, regardless of  your vaccination status.</p>
<p><strong>The CDC has not been consistent with both reports on what to expect with the vaccine and with COVID itself.</strong> </p>
<p>COVID has been with us for 17 months now, we hadn't we heard about "long-COVID" before now, which also happens to be conveniently coincide with news coverage the same time as the Delta variant and increased lockdown restrictions/vaccine passport demands.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Given this, as well as the inconsistent news articles, <strong>why is it unreasonable to request for more time for the CDC to be really sure of its data</strong> if there really is no funny bussiness going on here? Why is it unreasonable to want to wait even just 1 year BEFORE we say yes to vaccine passport MANDATES? Why is the consent to bodily autonomy viewed as a selfish thing, when the very source of information we are getting itself is convoluted and inconsistent?</p>
<p>Why is our natural immunity automatically discarded when it has helped us defeat all the illnesses we've had up to 2020? Why is the point specifically in those who have either already has COVID or at a low-risk group being disregarded as well? People have the right to do  their own risk-to-benefit analysis, do they not? Why does the government have to mandate a decision over their personal health for them?</p>
<p>The latest we were told with Delta is that we want to lockdown so that we  protect the children and immunocompromised. All the rest of the selfish unvaccinated plague rats can just die, as per you guys.</p>
<p>And to those of you who did it, don't pretend you didn't openly say that or circle jerk, because you most certainly did. We noticed that.</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>68%  of America has been vaccinated. Only 2% short of Biden's goal for deeming herd immunity hence full reopening. 70% was needed as a  reminder, to not overburden the healthcare system. 70% immunity was  needed to open up. 70% was needed to "flatten the curve". </p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Let's conduct a hypothetical.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Let's just say that ALL of us unvaccinated, selfishfilth-of-the-Earthplaguerat scum do die of Delta, which, by the way was also stated earlier was suppose to be a MILDER development of COVID, with symptoms resembling that of allergies, not TWICE as lethal.</p>
<p>That leaves children and the immunocompromised left. The vaccinated at that point can still spread COVID to them if society opened back up, as we know now. The virus can also mutate among the vaccinated, if society opened up. This was proven in recent weeks, when we were told  that vaccines don't in fact prevent you from getting and transmitting COVID. Why? Because the virus is not going away. <strong>It is here to stay,  like the flu and other rhinoviruses and coronaviruses that cause the cold.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also remember that, the goal was never to eradicate the virus, it was to limit the number  of deaths so that the hospital system does not become overwhelmed. We were focused on COVID</strong> <strong><em>deaths</em></strong>, not <strong><em>currently existing cases.</em></strong></p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>COVID itself has a 99.97% survival rate at the time of posting. The complications and extreme cases that required hospitalization that were highlighted by social media are to be expected. Why? Because this virus was introduced to this world in 2020. As far as we know, it did not exist prior to that. And because of that, there was no natural immunity built to combat it at that time. Meaning there were no antibodies for COVID in particular.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that, given how we now have access to international travel so quickly and accessibly unlike pandemics throughout history, a greater number of people will die. People will die at that, because the virus is completely new to their system. For some, it overwhelmed it and they weren't able to recover. This is typical of pandemics because like I said, there is no prior immune response to that particular virus.</p>
<p>Now we have the vaccines. Those who are afraid of the complications shown on social media, which, might I add did not always include people with the already pre-existing comorbidities, were driven to get vaccinated throughout this year. Some others also wanted to win prizes in various lotteries, California having offered $50,000, Canada having offered $1.3 million as well as workplaces offering all those juicy incentives.</p>
<p>Those who have already confirmed positive will, by very definition of immunity, have anti-bodies. Some of us who contracted it already prefer to rely on our natural anti-body response to deal with any variants of COVID. Prior to specifically these past few months, natural anti-bodies as a way of protection where generally not questioned. When we got sick as kids, we built up and worked out our immune response. We were told that if you have anti-bodies for a particular strain of the flu, you will never get that particular strain again.</p>
<p>So why is it that, when it comes to COVID, we are told that we can contract it again and again, regardless of vaccination status? If you had alpha, you were still told to get vaccinated. So why is it, that after being TOLD that if you get vaccinated, you will have a 99% chance of not contracting COVID, the number has jumped to 90% within the week? Not to mention multiple vaccinated people asking around saying "how is Delta for you?" Why were we told that the Vaccine can also protect against Delta as well, then? </p>
<p>There will soon be boosters. Are you really going to fall for this same game with Lambda, and the whole goddamned Greek Alphabet at that? Why can't you test your own immune response after having gotten the first 2 doses? </p>
<p>Similar to the flu, a good number of us went about our lives without <em>relying</em> on the flu shot as our only means of protection. Hence why we got sick, some of us maybe even being lucky with stronger immune systems and not having gotten sick at all!</p>
<p>Given this, why are the vaccine-hesitant who may have already contracted COVID not be allowed to cite natural immunity as a reason for not getting the vaccine, pre-mature of FDA approval and long-term data being released? </p>
<p>Please keep in mind, that PCR tests themselves have also been widely known to have false positives/negatives, and to this day they are not 100% reliable indicators of infection.</p>
<p>Also please note that only people who have CURRENTLY CONTRACTED COVID can SPREAD IT TO OTHERS. You cannot automatically assume that all unvaccinated people are actively COVID hosts, nor can you automatically assume that all vaccinated people are COVID-free since they could very well be COVID positive but asymptomatic.</p>
<p>The only exception to this I can think of is if you touch a surface that contains COVID, and immediately touch something else. That can also spread it.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Right now, countries like Australia are facing outright dystopian measures [<a href="https://twitter.com/ianmSC/status/1415734350356705282">1</a> <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/AtlantaRodgers/status/1415627563242713088">2</a>] for having a minimal amount of both cases and deaths. Again, as a reminder, the intention was not case control, since the virus is here to stay, but controlling the number of deaths.</p>
<p>If COVID is here to stay, children and the immunocompromised WILL at some  point contract COVID. It is inevitable. With Delta, the narrative is that it is THEM you are trying to protect. If they are going to eventually contract it in time anyways, what is stopping us from fully re-opening now, when we're only 2% short of the goal anyways?</p>
<p><strong>Why is it, that instead of controlling</strong> <strong><em>deaths</em></strong>, we are now controlling <strong><em>cases</em></strong>?</p>
<p>Why is it, that restrictions and mandates are only <em>doubling</em> in intensity, regardless of vaccination status and regardless of the actual number of deaths itself?</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>These, and many other unanswered questions, observed inconsistencies and outright hypocrisies observed from world leaders and various organizations are shared sentiments by the unvaccinated, and are among our biggest reasons for hesitancy.</strong></p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>I could go on more, but as a start, <strong>please start thinking critically about all that I just said</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>We are not your enemies.</strong></p>
<p>We too want this to end, but when you have open government corruption and vaccine mandates, it is not encouraging us in the slightest in favor of taking a vaccine that only has 6 months worth  of data and multiple inconsistencies that are still unanswered, and inability to sue or protect ourselves from any and all adverse effects.</p>
<p>Remember, you cannot undo this injection. It is an irreversible decision not to be taken lightly. Also remember that these same companies that are distributing already have a criminal record, some have had criminal lawsuits for failure to maintain transparency about their products sold in the past. 1 2 [due to the weird picture of the bear...not going to be doing anymore right now.]</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>And no, we are not all Pro-Trump supporters.</p>
<p>No, we aren't all white-redneck hillbillies. POC comprise a notable percentage of us.</p>
<p>No, we are not all American at that.</p>
<p>We are just people with questions that have not been answered, we are people who want to wait for more consistent data as well as long-term data to come out- you know, something that would actually be reflective of upholding the Scientific Method- before we decide we want to get this put in our bodies. We want those doctors that are warning about blood-clots to be wrong, if they are that means that we really are just covidiots. I would rather be a covidiot then not be permitted the space to be called one.</p>
<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>The only thing we have to truly gain here is our continued right to consent over bodily autonomy, and the continued freedom and ability to openly question our government and hold them accountable for the actions they impose over us.</strong> That's it. That is what this boils down to.</p>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>The freedom to openly discuss and question is the <strong>entire basis of Western Civilization</strong>, and we are on the edge of completely <strong>losing</strong> that ability whether you realize it or not.</p>
<p>We have questions and we want them answered honestly and responsibly, with no manipulation and no funny-business, and so far the CDC, MSM and multiple governmental bodies and leaders have failed tremendously at that delivering that to us citizens. They have failed to be transparent with us up to now, and when you are deciding something permanent like this, we <strong>need</strong> answers and unrestricted discussion.</p>
<p>Sincerely, a fellow human being.</p></p>

        <p>I hate text walls on reddit (probably a mobile thing), but I read most of the first half! You’re spot on my dude. Hopefully this helps people understand where we’re coming from.</p>
<p>I think from my stand-point. I don’t trust the government (who looks more and more like big brother every day), and absolutely do not trust for profit, giant pharmaceutical companies. So in lamen terms, i’m as afraid of getting the vaccine as you are (not you specifically you, but those who may be reading) of contracting covid-19. I did get covid, I barely got sick. No one in my house got sick too (wore a mask when I left my room, wiped down surfaces after touching them) it’s not a scary virus. But that vaccine is killing young people. Giving them permanent heart damage. I can’t risk that for myself or my family.</p>

        <p>You seem to have a very stretchy definition of gene therapy. </p>
<p>The J&amp;J vaccine contains a virus which invades a cell, hijacks it, and causes it to create proteins similar enough to covid so that when the body fights off the infection it has learned how to fight off covid too.</p>
<p>Every virus does the same thing too, so by that definition the last time you had a cold it was also gene therapy (or gene manipulation rather).</p>
<p>Funnily enough, most vaccines work on that principle, including the very first one invented for smallpox in the 1700s. There the cowpox virus was used to invade cells, hijack them, and to create proteins similar enough to smallpox so that when the body fought off the infection it learned how to fight off smallpox too.</p>

        <p>Those are also traditional vaccines with 10+ years worth of data on safety, efficacy and ingredients</p>
<p>mRNA vaccines have never before been used in people, and never to this scale. You are comparing 2 different types of vaccines at this point, so it's not fair to draw comparisons between them.</p>

        <p>J&amp;J is not mRNA.</p>
<p>The argument about how long the vaccines have been out is one thing, but there is a scary amount of people throwing out the "gene therapy" argument despite there being more traditional non-mRNA vaccines available as well.</p>

        <p>rAd26 is *NOT* a 'traditional' way of making vaccines. I can't believe that people are saying this almost a YEAR after the vaxxes were announced.</p>
<p>Here's a great explanation of how the J&amp;J vaxx works: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine.html">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine.html</a></p>
<p>Once you have read it, and actually understand that THERE'S NOTHING TRADITIONAL ABOUT IT, feel free to respond.</p>

        <p>I get where you're coming from but timing is key right now. We need to stop the hate and start educating them on why we feel the way we do in a logical manner, we are only perpetuating the division. I know there are still people out there who are silently skeptical, if we can get them to see why we feel the way we do we may have a chance at stopping the totalitarian regimes trying to go underway. Our timing is now though, LA will be leading the US back to where it was and if we fall there won't be much hope left in this</p>
