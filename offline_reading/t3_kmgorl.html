        <p>Notice how the story doesn't report the age of the deceased?  It's sad when old people die, but nothing can prevent it.</p>

        <p>Of course! And I thought symptoms took time to show up? Seems the sister started showing symptoms that evening? Also inferring from their 59 years of marriage that would mean at least 77 years old if they got married at the tender young age of 18. This story is horseshit.</p>
