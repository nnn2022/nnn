    <strong>Any other teenagers feel like they missed out on a lot of experiences because of covid?</strong>
    <p><p>First-world problem I know, but damn this really had to happen during senior year. My days of sneaking out to concerts and moshing in people's backyards are over, but on the bright side I haven't gotten arrested since the pandemic started and I'm now old enough to attend most concerts without having to sneak in. Here's to hoping college, festivals, and everything else opens back up by the fallüôè</p></p>

        <p>I honestly feel for teenagers who are missing so much due to this propaganda driven state. No proms, very little hanging out and just being stupid, etc..  They've stolen a very large and very important part of your life from you and we just sat still and let it happen.  I'm sorry for my part in not paying attention and trying to change things before we let it get this bad.  Hopefully you can make up for it in the next few years when they finally admit it's not as deadly as they made it out to be and we can go back to what is then considered 'normal'.</p>

        <p>In a way, lockdowns have fucked teenagers over but there's always the positives. I feel a lot more mature and spending so much time with my toxic family has pretty much made me into Buddha and I feel like I can tolerate anything now. </p>
<p>Plus I think if you can find fun in everything, "growing up" becomes a choice and life will always be fun no matter how old you are or what circumstances you're in.</p>

        <p>I am so so sorry
As a 27 year old I couldn‚Äôt imagine if this had happened during my teenage years. All of the awesome memories I made couldn‚Äôt have happened.
I really hope you get to a concert soon üòî</p>

        <p>Even if its still "first world problems" you have a god given right to enjoy yourself and live life as you should be. Meet with friends, go out and play, explore life in all its forms, explore other human beings and grow your experiences that will make you into a man/woman.</p>
<p>It's normal and natural as it should be. It's what you are born to do. It's like putting a tiger in a cage and prive it of the beauty of running and hunting. You see those animal's facial expression in the cages, how much they hurt.</p>
<p>It's like blocking sunrays to a tree. Putting a plant in its not natural environment. It will fade and die slowly. </p>
<p>It's not first world problems, it's how nature works. 
Some of the third/second world countries have children much happier than ours, they have less things, appreciate little stuff much more, life life happily and in an easier way, even if they have so much less. </p>
<p>A television, a fancy car, a big home is not what makes us human. Connection, empathy, love, experiences, mistakes its what makes us human.</p>

        <p>I feel for teenagers going through this. Thinking back , it was at high school football games, class trips, extra curricular activities, etc away from parents where I really discovered who I was and wanted to be. So many teens are not going to be ready for the challenges of the real world because they've never had any experience with it.</p>
