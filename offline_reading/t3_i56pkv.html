    <strong>Can you all stop comparing lockdown to the holocaust? It discredits our movement</strong>
    <p><p>It’s like Karen’s ruining stores because they don’t want to wear a mask. Sure, masks shouldn’t be mandated but when people act like that it makes us look crazy. Comparing lockdown to Nazi germany is like comparing Trump to hitler. I agree the lockdown is some dystopian shit but comparing it to the Holocaust makes us look dumb</p></p>

        <p>I mean...I’d challenge you to do your research as well. Hitler killed 11 MILLION PEOPLE by lying to them. Do you think our ~~leaders~~ dictators are being truthful?  Do you think the MSM has your best interest?  The Jews boarded the trains to Auschwitz <strong>voluntarily</strong> “for their protection” (sound familiar?). </p>
<p>I agree that lockdowns themselves are not the Holocaust, but how long do we go from “just a mask” to “just a [forced] test”?  And of course <strong><em>ANYONE</em></strong> can test positive for Covid because of the asymptomatic nature of the virus. So now, even if you feel perfectly fine, you can test “positive” for Covid (and you CANT prove them wrong), and soon you’ll be sent to to a ~~concentration camp~~ “Quarantine Resort.”</p>
<p>Go check out the book “How to Kill 11 People” by Andy Andrews. It makes you think...  </p>
<p>Everything we do in the United States is controlled by 536 individuals, and you don’t think there’s enough corruption out there not to pull something off?  We already have the masses in fear ~~looking~~  BEGGING to be controlled with MSM and (anti)social media controlling the agenda. </p>
<p><strong>It’s literally Hitler’s wet dream.</strong></p>
<p>I seriously hope you’re right and this isn’t the Holocaust, but I also think we’re in a society that’s trying to forget a lot about history...  </p>
<p>Keep up the good fight - if you’re against lockdowns and idiots, I’m supportive of the cause.  And honestly if I do compare the current situation to the Holocaust, it’s on anti-lockdown platforms like this... it’s not like Doomers get it anyway...</p>

        <p>I disagree. There are a lot of similarities that can be drawn. Just to name a few:
- Ratting out your neighbours for having people over (outing Jews for roundups) 
- The government telling us to condemn those who didn’t lockdown/wear masks/question the potential vaccine (the government telling them to condemn the Jews)
- Concentration camps (Covid camps)
- Authorizing officials to enter homes by force to ensure compliance and seize/fine people who aren’t “self-isolating” (authorized force to enter homes to seize the Jews)
- Contact tracing to identify Covid infected people (forced tattoo. I know this one may seem like it’s reaching, but I can guarantee contact tracing will lead to physical identification at some point).</p>
<p>I think we’re on the path to seeing much more similarities to the Holocaust.</p>

        <p>Hitler didn't start out by saying, "Hey, let's eradicate Jews." He started out by saying, "Wow, Germany is sure having a declining birthrate and the cities are really loaded with poor people who can't take care of themselves properly. They have such horrible living conditions and they just spread disease to each other (syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis etc.). We should do something about this! We need to help those who can't help themselves!" People always think about that time period and think that everything was black and white, like Hitler rode in on a black horse, wearing a black hat and he was easily recognizable as a villain, or that the anti-semitism was really blatant from the start. People will say that they would never have behaved in a way that would have put Jews in harm's way and that they would have stood up to the evil. Only, no, they wouldn't have. The evil wasn't starkly apparent in the beginning. It was couched in benevolent terms. In fact, it was originally framed as a widespread public health issue. (Sound familiar?) Slowly, the parameters for delineating the public health issue shifted. Now, instead of being about a widespread public health problem it became, "Hey, you ever notice that these problems seem to be more common amongst these certain people? Weird. Maybe if we focused our attentions on helping them, we'd have better luck solving this problem. Meanwhile, we need to get the rest of us, who are healthy breeding stock, to bring the birthrate up." And it just kept tip-toeing along like that. Slowly revoking rights and drawing the noose around certain demographics, while egging the rest of the public on to support the measures. While I agree that the Nazi comparison is horribly overused, in this instance, it is justified. Look at what is happening in Australia right now. You must show your papers to authorities in order to move from place to place. (Look at what happened to Raven Black when she defied orders. Publicly crucified. People laughing about what happened to her and saying it served her right.) Police can enter your home without a warrant. Freedom of movement is totally restricted and Victorians are encouraged to rat out their neighbors for violations. Can you imagine how the Jews in Melbourne feel right now when asked to show their papers? <br>
Here's an excerpt from an article originally published on the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum:<br>
The concept of racial hygiene had deep roots in Germany. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, growing numbers of medical and public health professionals decried Germany’s declining birth rate and the perceived biologic “degeneration” of the nation and proposed reforms to improve the quantity and quality of the population. Rapid industrialization and urbanization had created overcrowded cities, with attendant conditions of extensive poverty and crime; the spread of tuberculosis, syphilis, gonorrhea, and other contagious diseases; and expanding numbers of persons identified by psychiatrists as mentally ill or retarded, who required special care. These changes coincided with a blossoming of medical research and the establishment of dozens of new institutes and laboratories. Breakthroughs in bacteriology and the emerging field of genetics — the publication of August Weismann’s theory of immutable germ-plasm in the 1890s and the “rediscovery” of Gregor Mendel’s laws of heredity in 1900 — seemed to promise biologic or medical solutions to Germany’s problems. Physicians and medical researchers began to view themselves as the guides to a healthy, moral, industrious Germany…  </p>
<p>Some physicians and biologists who supported eugenics had to accommodate themselves to Nazism’s rabid anti-Semitism. But in return for accepting the persecution of Jews as a source of biologic degeneration, many in the medical community welcomed the new emphasis on biology and heredity, increased research funding, and new career opportunities — including openings created by the purge of Jews and leftists from the medical and public health fields…</p>

        <p>I used to think it was a disrespectful comparison but now I’m not so sure. There are people who believe that people who don’t wear masks or social distance deserve to die. I mean how far are we away from a situation where people who refuse the vaccine are killed to “protect” everyone else?</p>

        <p>To answer your question at the end of your post, I wasn’t totally thinking they’d kill those who refuse but I could see them being taken to something like a re-education or concentration camp to try to get them to take it, even by force. However, it is also true that lots of people tend to die in concentration camps.</p>

        <p>Wasn’t it Alex Jones (not a fan but some things he says are right) who said that Walmart’s would be used for FEMA camps? Not sure where I will draw a line in the sand but it will be awfully hard to resist a forced vaccination if I have to go with my family to a re-education camp of some sort. I’m not anti-VAX by any means and everyone in my family is fully vaccinated but this rushed vaccine is suspicious from so many different angles.</p>

        <p>I studied prohibition years ago and I was thinking about how it probably felt like there was no end in sight and way to get their freedom back for a lot of people, but eventually they did, and that sort of made me feel better about our situation.</p>
<p>Would you say that was a reasonable point? Like how did they get out of it and can we use the same techniques? (Collapse the economy? FS, I was hoping we could avoid that)</p>

        <p>&rt; Like how did they get out of it and</p>
<p>It really was the Great Depression. The state and federal governments needed the taxes they lost to Prohibition. Legalizing liquor brought that money back.</p>
<p>We're going to see this same thing happen with lockdowns if it goes too long. We're already seeing states raising taxes to pay for all the stimulus. And it's causing wealthy individuals to relocate. I mean, if it's work-from-home and remotely indefinitely, why live in a high tax location?</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm really not sure what the world is going to look like if people flee cities.</p>
<p>I'm English and live in a rural area and we have problems (across the UK) with people from towns and cities moving to villages/farming areas and then complaining about the roosters, farm smells, church bells, mud on the road from tractors (that keep us fed!) or having to stop for cows to cross the road... petitioning to change things. I really hate it. </p>

        <p>Same. I live in rural California and we're seeing an influx of people from LA and other cities moving here and then saying, "This place would be great if there weren't so many noisy roosters." Replace "noisy roosters" with a whole laundry list of other things and you get the picture. They're forming "community groups" to make changes, but not including the community that was already living here. Plus, they're buying up property and driving up prices, forcing farmers out that have been here for ages. Makes me sad. I feel your pain.</p>

        <p>It's disgusting. I can't imagine moving somewhere nice and deciding to change everything. The newcomers aren't as considerate in my experience, like they leave their cars parked on the pavement when they know the bins are being collected, play music loudly at night, that sort of thing. </p>
<p>Luckily people in the village go out and pick litter but they shouldn't have to.</p>
<p>If I sell my house I would prefer to sell to someone local. I was looking at old school photos from my grandad and great grandads eras and a lot of the last names were the same as kids I went to school with, I love that and don't want it to change. I think it also keeps crime lower because everyone knows everyone.</p>

My husband and I aren't some wealthy urbanites, but we do wish to move to a more rural area, and we're afraid of those people fleeing the cities buying up land before we can. That, and we're afraid the locals wherever we move might lump us in with those city slickers! No lol I love hearing roosters</p>

        <p>You will be welcome as long as you fit in and don't cause problems for others (anti social behaviour). The fact that you're considering what people will think probably means you'll be fine.</p>
<p>Another issue is people moving somewhere that generally votes right wing (because they tend to be nicer areas imo) and start voting left and change the area that way.</p>
<p>Nice anecdote: the last time we had bad snow here, cars were sliding back down a hill and everyone was stuck, so a family of farmers jumped in their tractors and towed everyone up. The country is lovely but choose your car wisely lol</p>

        <p>We're more asocial than antisocial, we just want peace and quiet. Worst we might do is occassionally play Baby Shark or Alice In Chains too loud. I also might build a ~~laser cannon~~ high-powered security light, but that's neither here nor there.</p>
<p>And we probably won't be voting at all, don't wanna put ourselves out there like that.</p>
<p>And we have a truck. I don't drive, don't know much about vehicles, but I think it's okay for driving up frozen hills. We get that kind of stuff here, our area is somewhat rural and hilly with rough winters. Just not rural enough for us to feel secure in the long term.</p>

        <p>Considering I've seen some people sharing what looks like Nazi-style propaganda in defense of masks and other measures, I think it's a fair comparison. Maybe not the Holocaust itself, as in the "final solution" but definitely the decline into it, which took years. It didn't start overnight. No one readily agrees to that when it's presented all at once. It happens over time.</p>

        <p>The comparison is extreme, but valid. Both the Holocaust and the current lockdowns involve civilians snitching on each other, officials entering homes without permission, and paperwork to prove whether or not you have a valid reason to live your life. Many places are even pushing to break up households and send people to quarantine camps. History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme.</p>
