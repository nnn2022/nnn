    <strong>If I Were an Elite and My Goal Was Depopulation</strong>
    <p><p>In following along with what already has happened with the coronavirus, and assuming it was created in a lab:</p>
<p>I would not make these vaccines cause mass infertility, although any that become infertile would be a bonus.  I would not make the vaccines slow the spread necessarily.  I wouldn’t necessarily make the vaccines deadly, although any that got killed off would be a bonus. </p>
<p>I would want to get as many people vaxxed as possible as a sort of litmus test.</p>
<p>The primary goal for the vax would not be to provide immunity to coronavirus.  It would be to provide immunity to a much, much deadlier virus/bio weapon that I would later release to the public after all my sheep have been vaccinated from it.</p>
<p>That way I get to keep my sheep/enablers while all the skeptics die off.  Then, with nobody left to resist it’s:</p>
<p><strong>Checkmate</strong></p>
<p>Note: I’m just sort of thinking out loud here.  Any discussion is welcome!</p></p>

        <p>I would side with this theory as long as they do not mandate vaccines. If they mandate them and require virtually everyone to get one, then skeptics will be forced and will survive the hypothetical next virus. </p>
<p>In Bill Cooper’s book Behold A Pale Horse, he brought up an interesting point on depopulation. (Keep in mind to take everything with a grain of salt) </p>
<p>He said that child bearing age women would be the main target. Hence why you have abortion so rampant. Or wars where women and children are high casualties (middle east, Vietnam, etc.) 
With this vaccine women have been reporting changes in their menstrual cycle. Not jumping to conclusions here, but in time we will see if the vaccine effects women long term. </p>
<p>Truly an interesting time to be alive</p>

        <p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>My wife got the first shot of Moderna and a month later got her first period in 4 years.  Coincidence?  Maybe, but with all the other women reporting menstrual cycle changes I find it unlikely.</p>

        <p>No she’s only 29 lol.</p>
<p>She’s on some kind of birth control that lasts a long time, like a few years I think?  It’s a shot.  Sorry I don’t know much about it but I do know she hasn’t had a period in 4 years until a month after taking the jab.</p>

        <p>They would if they could. </p>
<p>Except vaccines are a bunch of crock to begin with, all of them. There's ample proof in the decline of all diseases due to nutrition, hygiene and pesticide bans long before vaccines came along to take credit for them. </p>
<p>Possibly germ theory itself is crock too, and terrain theory is where it's at. </p>
<p>So they really aren't capable of doing that elaborate plan.</p>
<p>All they can do is kill or maim enough of those dumb enough to poison themselves,  and go after others the old fashioned way with hate and violence.</p>

        <p>Nope, this was just a psyop to convince conspiracy types to get the vaccine. If the elites can't control the spread of it, they won't release it. Lest they or their loved ones get infected and die because no cure for anything is ever 100%. </p>
<p>So they use what they can control, and what people can consent to. But which fits both of these criteria? The vaccine or a virus?</p>

        <p>It does answer it. If the “super deadly” virus reaches the elites’ families they’re screwed. Hence why they wouldn’t release a “super deadly” virus unless they had a 100% cure or could hide away (both nearly impossible). </p>
<p>The elites are also obsessed with consent due to their belief in karmic debt. You can directly consent to taking a vaccine, but you can’t directly consent to catching a virus. </p>
<p>I can tell you’re being genuine with this discussion, which is nice, but this angle is being inorganically pushed on dissident forums as a way to get people to take the shot. I’m just trying to warn people it’s not going to happen.</p>

        <p>No, your second sentence doesn’t address the whole crux of what I was saying.  </p>
<p>That’s the vaccine specifically protecting against the super deadly virus that would be released later.  So the elites being theoretically vaccinated would be protected from that, along with the sheep.</p>
<p>Polio has been eradicated by vaccines so I don’t understand the 100% cure not being attainable angle.</p>

        <p>I’ll agree to disagree. But if you’re going to get the vaccine (and drag others with you) because of this  errant belief you deserved to be called out</p>

        <p>I’ve already stated I’m not getting the vaccine.  </p>
<p>Nowhere did I mention that people should get the vaccine.  </p>
<p>I’ve never encouraged people to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>ITS JUST A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT.  And nobody has been able to logically dismantle it yet.</p>
<p>Are you afraid of thoughts? Is that why your downvoting?  Are you a shill?</p>

        <p>I'm almost sure that's <em>not</em> what's going on, though it's an interesting subject. If it were the plan, they wouldn't be trying to cover up and censor most adverse reactions, and they wouldn't be attempting to coerce people to get it. It would be 100% optional, with no real rewards, no exemptions from other measures, no extra travel rights, etc. They'd want the percentage of people who get it to be fairly small, only the most loyal and submissive 10% or so.</p>

        <p>The thing is the coercion and everything is so obvious to us.  Only sheep would fall for that.  As for the percentage they want being fairly small, I would posit that this would just be the initial culling on a slippery slope to even more cullings in the future.</p>
<p>I must say this again since I’m being accused by people of conducting a psy op, that I’m not taking the vaccine no matter what, nor am I trying to scare people.</p>
<p>I’m simply conducting a thought exercise and inviting discussion on what would be the best play for the elites IF their goal is depopulation.</p>

        <p>I actually don't give many credit to the elite theory and their depopulation thing. I think they're just vultures, they only want more and more money. 
The pandemic, wether they pumped it up with media or not, is just another carcass for their feast.  </p>
<p>Also, through the vaccine, if it was really a bioweapon for depopulation, they'd kill most of their supporters, all the "science cultists", all the people that get their truths from the media. Plus, many journalists, technicians, doctors and so on had the vaccines, so they'd kill the backbone of their plan. Without doctors, who would cure them? Without technicians, for example, who would run a nuclear plant? With all vaxxed students, who would carry on the civilization and their welfare? And why would they want to lose billions of dollars of profit by exterminating their source of income?</p>
<p>No, I think that they're just manipulating everything to get the highest profit but they don't have a clue to what comes next. In fact, if the vaccine is dangerous for real they just fucked up for good.</p>
