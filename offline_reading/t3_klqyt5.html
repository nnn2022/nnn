        <p>Yes!! We learned this in nursing school to show us why we need to be extra careful and adhere to the FIVE RIGHTS and then they force you to rush everything as much as possible to prove you can cut it in a real hospital environment. I was nearly flunked early on for being "too slow", but when I told the teacher I was just being careful, she got an intrigued look and said something like oh okay yeah, I'll pass you then. I'll never forget that. I was second semester, still learning the basics. </p>
<p>Oddly enough my new job is always harping on making sure we don't make mistakes and then they require everyone take a certain OBSCENE amount of calls and never log off the phones, so that we can't properly chart one patient's concerns and needs without having to take care of the next patient as soon as they call. It causes burnout and high turnover, and of course many mistakes. Our office found a way to streamline one of our most time consuming tasks. It also 100% prevented mistakes with that task. We were told we couldn't use it because the old way is just as good. So we do it behind corporate's backü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
