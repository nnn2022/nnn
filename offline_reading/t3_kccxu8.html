    <strong>Can I just lie and say I can't take the vaccine because of severe allergic reactions?</strong>
    <p><p>No matter what happens I will never take the vaccine, that said couldn't we just say we can't take it because of allergies? Will they even ask for proof?</p></p>

        <p>Currently, if you are unable to wear a mask for any medical reason, the US Airlines will refuse to let you fly.</p>
<p>You may be able to refuse a vaccine, but you may lose access to much of the world.</p>
<p>We used to have laws preventing this sort of thing but we're ignoring them now. And the ADA had gone from aggressive persecution mode to complete silence in protection of those with disabilities.</p>

        <p>The actions (or non-actions) of advocates for the disabled and those with mental health issues are nothing short of a dereliction of duty on their part.</p>
<p>The same organizations that will sue a business into the ground for not installing tens of thousands of dollars of hardware due to the minuscule chance that a quadriplegic might want to try rock-climbing, have nothing to say when businesses deny the basic right of access to those who can't wear a mask.</p>

<p>Agree 100%. </p>
<p>I haven't seen it personally, but I've heard a number of people (apart from myself, I mean) here on the autism spectrum talking about how any discussion of folks with sensory issues and their problems with the cuckmuzzles getting memory holed on the bigger autism support forums. Given what Reddit is like, I don't doubt it in the slightest.</p>
<p>Thing about that is a lot, I mean a LOT of autistic people have sensory issues.</p>

        <p>An exception to this is Sara Gelser, a Democratic state senator. She actually wants schools closed - BUT she has been leading the legal fight in Oregon against eugenic killing of the handicapped in Oregon.</p>
<p>I don't see it talked about on here much but I think there is a eugenics aspect to this New Normal garbage. I think the opportunity to cull "useless eaters" (as the Nazis called them) is being taken.</p>

<p>And "laws" are not there to protect you, but are threats of violence against you to force you to behave in a certain way.</p>

        <p>It is, but it leads to an interesting commentary.  A lot of laws only seem to get enforced by watchdog groups aggressively pursuing them.  I've always considered such groups irritating at best, malicious at worst.  But it turns out when they turn a blind eye, many laws simply get ignored, and it really is to our collective detriment.  Basically, when ratting out your neighbor or local business is the only way laws get enforced, it's bad both when people are doing so, and when they stop?</p>

        <p>So it sounds like people who are allergic to ingredients in the vaccine and really can't take it may be shut out of society at some point, through no fault of their own. Lovely. I even saw a comment from someone on another sub, a doomer-ish one, that any immunocompromised people who can't take the vaccine should just be staying at home. I never knew people thought like that until someone told me to stay home because I can't wear a mask for long.</p>

        <p>that's very ironic as well seeing thats basically what anti-lockdown people have said and doomers always shoot it down</p>
<p>which was : if you're at high risk for covid, stay home. </p>
<p>now they want to turn that against people who have legitimate medical concerns with masks or vaccines </p>
<p>at the beginning of all this mask exemptions existed but then all businesses said no mask no service. </p>
<p>I only saw a maskless person at the doctors and I am assuming it is because of a medical condition.</p>

        <p>Yeah, they're flipping it, LOL. </p>
<p>Over time, it seems the businesses are honouring the mask exemptions less and less. I really thought people with asthma like me would "get away" with not wearing them, but then I ended up wearing a bandanna because I got look at like I was a plague rat if I didn't wear anything. It doesn't help that the "Mask Required" part of every sign is huge and the exemptions are in small print at the bottom, probably by design so some people might not even realize there are any.</p>

        <p>Ugh! When this started, only some stores had them listed on their sign, but they were supposed to be using the official sign from the health unit, which lists exemptions... I complained about one store and noticed that the sign got changed a few days later, LOL.</p>

        <p>They didn't think like that when it was convenient not to.  The virtue signaling used to be "disabled people should be able to do anything others can do, and should be accommodated 100% of the time!"  Then a new issue came along and they forgot their old ones.  I think liberals used to came about poverty too, but that one isn't trendy now either.</p>

        <p>I don't think they let you off so easily, but that would be a solution if possible.</p>
<p>Though I struggle to accept the very realistic outcome that I will have to face my death in the very near future. Not that I want to live in a fascist shithole of a world anyway but my survival instinct/fear of death doesn't care about that.</p>

        <p>Ive grappled with this too. I am not an anti-vaxxer by any means, but I feel like anyone with half a brain <em>should</em> be able to see through the bullshit they are trying to sell us. There is no way in hell that I will willingly be an experiment. I have accepted that I probably won’t have much life left. I don’t <em>want</em> to die, but I also don’t want to live in this world anymore if this shit gets much worse.</p>

        <p>Technically for me that would likely be true but I have no doctor or anything so I couldn't really get proof if I wanted to. I just know I have a degree of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity that used to be far worse before I got on the correct detox plan for myself as well as other issues. I know my body better than anyone else and I don't need someone to tell me what I already know about it or at worst assume things about it. It's a waste to deal with medical industry and it always has been.</p>
