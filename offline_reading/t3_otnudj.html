        <p>I don’t know who else saw this commercial literally daily but they were like “why did you get vaccinated?” Then some other person goes “to go back to normal”. Little did they know they got fucked in their ass. Imagine getting vaccinated yet they tell you to keep fucking dreaming of going back to normal and to put that damn mask back on.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile they are ruining careers of good Soldiers, issuing out GOMRS (General Officers Memorandum of Reprimand) due to refusing to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. There's going to be hell to pay when I get found out that I'm not vaxxed. My command has been pushing it sooooooo hard. I sat in a meeting this morning where XO spouted off about getting everyone vaxxed and how dangerous the coof is for a solid 15 minutes (we pulled a company out of the field early because they had a cold going around and it's a billion degrees here on NC... and it's throwing their training schedule off).</p>
<p>Luckily I'm TAD and my medical records aren't at this battalion.</p>
<p>Edit: luckily it's the Marine Corps, and I got green weenied hard earlier this year... so now I hate my job so much that getting fired and sent to a worse job would be kinda like "meh".</p>

        <p>Falling through the cracks, nice.</p>
<p>I do enjoy reading the articles that shame the branches for not being vaccinated and such. If only they knew how we all felt at the company level.</p>

        <p>We have one company that was basically told "you don't deploy unless you get vaccinated" they're at 95%. We have another company that not deploying for like 18 months... 10%</p>

        <p>They were throwing that around here but I know multiple people slated to deploy in a couple months that haven't and don't plan on getting vaccinated until that mandatory order comes down.</p>
<p>Now with this reversal they are literally meme'ing those that got it. Good times all around.</p>

        <p>I can't wait for the shitstorm that is about to ensue. The Marine Corps is only good at 1 thing. And we sate our lust for that 1 thing by doing crappy MEU deployments and other busy work. But we've been sitting on our hands for the last 6 years, and the last year we've been holding our breath too...</p>
<p>I mean hell... This week we've had a suicide ideation and an attempt. THIS WEEK. It's only Wednesday! If we don't go to war again soon the Marine Corps is going to eat itself. But if history is any indicator we'll be at war again within the year. My guess when Biden was "elected" was that it would be by the new FY. And Afghanistan is always on standby... because the Talibs took over the second we left. We'll see how it goes. Lol</p>

<p>Literally after being in the field all day come home start reading random bullshit, saw this and then within 20mins the commander pushed out mask requirements. The memo is circulating every where as well.</p>
<p>Just Google: "Deputy SecDef issues masks guidance" and the pdf is one of the first links.</p>
