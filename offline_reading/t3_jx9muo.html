    <strong>Actual numbers/percentages- why isn't this being talked about?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all, just curious about the actual raw numbers in terms of population and the death rate and looking for a discussion. I've had this talk with my parents and they still think this is an enormous amount of people?? What am I missing here?? I've tried searching reddit and haven't found much, but could be the abysmal search function. </p>
<p>I've also googled the death rate as it relates to the population and nothing of note comes back, just the typical fear mongering graphs and CDC information.</p>
<p>The US population is ~340 million people. So far (according to the media) covid has killed 250,000, or .07% of the population!!! POINT ZERO SEVEN!</p>
<p>Rounding up, 12 million in the US have been infected or 3.5% of the population.</p>
<p>I fail to see how and why we are in the current state we're in given these numbers. The media makes it seems as though this thing is killing people left and right. Can someone explain this to me?</p>
<p>I'm beyond frustrated with the constant news cycle, the stories of healthy people dying... people die EVERYDAY whether young, old, healthy, sick, etc. </p>
<p>I'm pregnant with my first child and am admittedly over emotional, but I am being robbed of so many experiences because of these senseless restrictions I had to vent.</p></p>

        <p>This is called "big number bad". </p>
<p>I heard a bay area morning news show yesterday say that over 2 million people in the US have died since the start of the pandemic. </p>
<p>They didn't say "of all causes", they just left it and so it implied that over 2 million people have died of covid.</p>

        <p>I think this is actually a difficult one to find the actual numbers of deaths since there is incentive from the hospitals to state a death was covid when it was actually not even close to that! I know the CDC gave us a percentage of 6% of the deaths were just covid on it's own and nothing else, I'm not sure what the current percentage is because that's not something that is readily or easily available but I would look at the excess deaths. I would ignore watching the mainstream news because they are fear mongering and not giving the true picture of what's going on, which is that 99.7% recovery rate. The PCR tests that are used are not fit for the job they are being used for, it's great at giving us false-positives which is said that 90% of those folks are not contagious. There is a greater agenda at play (vaccine, great reset) which is why the lockdowns are taking place. Also, congrats on your first child!</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, you have already answered your own question. The media drives the narrative. Most people are far to lazy, or stupid, to do the math. It is far easier for them to be spoon fed the disinformation by the media. They then put a label on people such as yourself, who did the math and see the virus for what it is. You are labeled a denier, covidiot, trumpist, and the cause of the problem. </p>
<p>The media has been called the Fourth Branch Government for a reason. They parrot the talking points to further an agenda. The only way a government can grow is through more control. </p>
<p>Congrats on the little one on the way. I wish you all the best.</p>

        <p>It's the same in my country in Eastern Europe. Literally 0.04% of the population has died from "covid" (even though there have been records of people dying from something completely different and doctors slapping this stupid virus on the death certificate to pump up the numbers). </p>
<p>So 0.04% yeah? Well, gyms and indoors dining/bars are closed, everything closes at 9PM and we have a 11PM - 5AM curfew. Some counties and towns are quarantined and the mask is mandatory outside everywhere. </p>
<p>The worst thing is most people I know whom I thought were smart and rational are scared shitless and hiding in their homes and acting as if I'm the crazy one for not being scared. The part of the population that is not scared and have tried protesting are painted by the media as far right extremists brainwashed by Russians. I mean some of them are; but this reputation is the reason that many likeminded people (virus related) like me and my <em>elderly</em> mother are forced to express ourselves quietly to each other to not be labeled as crazy far righters Bill Gates 5G conspirationists with tinfoil hats. </p>
<p>Also my friend got this thing (she thinks so, had a fever and lost taste and smell and was drowsy for a few days, but didn't get tested officially because fuck the statistics and the Direction of public health) and she said it's nothing more than a bullshit cold and the world is exaggerating. Oh and also here if you get tested positive the police will check you if you are quarantining. It's crazy and I feel I'm going crazy.</p>
