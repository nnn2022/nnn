    <strong>My niece and her "covid bubble" I worry about her growing up</strong>
    <p><p>My niece is 11.5, and has 1 friend, she has only ever HAD 1 friend because my sister kept her "unschooled" for years doing no homework except for "my little passport" She behaves like a 3 year old and has 0 social skills, school skills and my sister is totally using lockdowns to mask her inability to parent. My niece has basically lived at her house 24/7 her entire life, and my mother just stands up for my sister because my sister's career looks good to her. She visited my mom a few weeks ago, and my sister made her wear a mask at the park when other kids were not, eventhough she was touching all the same equipment, and wasn't aloud to go see her 1 friend for like 9 months. I can't imagine how this is good or healthy, but she's torally using Lockdowns as an excuse. As a future mother (Currently pregnant with our first) I could never do this to my child! Is CPS conserned at ALL?</p></p>

        <p>If I was your sister and you called CPS I would punch you and then disown you. CPS is not some hotline you call when people are parenting in a way you don’t like it’s only to be called when children are being abused. Having a good social life isn’t that important for a child having a loving parent is if you’re truly concerned talk to your sister and maybe try to understand her views on parenting instead of being judgmental and it’s really none of your business.</p>

        <p>I think having a good social life is important and I agree this kid doesn't have the greatest life, but I also agree that calling CPS isn't something to be done lightly.</p>

        <p>My sister did the same thing with her daughter, she was "picked on" on the school bus so she "home schooled" her.  My niece is now a twenty year old wierdo that will never adjust to normal life.
Home schooling should be more regulated.</p>

        <p>This kid needs CPS. Her mother is a monster </p>
<p>She’s almost a teenager....with the changes naturally when in puberty this kid will be seen as feral. Does she at least have language skills? Otherwise she will be a dead ringer for severe autism</p>
