        <p>Rofl. I keep seeing people say that too. "If people just just listened and did what they were told it would be over with!"</p>
<p>Oh... I thought like that too when all of this started. Now thankfully, I know better.</p>

        <p>Where I live, something like 99.5% of the population is in compliance with the mask ordinances. The virus continues to spread. I know there are hundreds of other places around the world where the masks and lockdowns have failed to contain the virus, and don't even correlate to slowing the spread.  Anyone who says "if you would just do what we're proposing it would all go away" is a fool or a liar. Probably both.</p>

        <p>Bingo. The virus is going to virus as the saying goes.</p>
<p>Masks have been proven by studies (Danish) and by simple observation of what is going on right now to do NOTHING.</p>
<p>Why? Because in areas where there were NO mask mandates and areas where there WERE mask mandates? Both are having about the same problem with CoVid-19 spreading!</p>
<p>Time to acknowledge frigging reality here: CoVid-19 was always going to spread and we might have exacerbated the problem by not letting it 'tear through' our population and burn itself out!</p>
<p>As numerous viruses in the past have burned themselves out!</p>

        <p>The big difference between previous viruses like the Hong Kong flu in 69 and earlier dangerous rhinoviruses is social media and the internet.</p>
<p>Humanity is now cursed with being incapable of reacting reasonably to anything because of social media.  </p>
<p>The efficiency and access to information wasn't worth the sociological and psychological damage that the internet has wrought.</p>

        <p>You guys need to fucking STOP playing into their hand stating the obvious science behind masks not being effective, we know it's not about accuracy of facts it's about behavioral control, lol.</p>
<p>The entire point is to create mandates that are impossible to follow so they have infinite plausible deniability in all directions WHEN NOTHING CHANGES BECAUSE WE KNOW THIS IS BULLSHIT, lol.</p>
<p>They've created a shell game virus and everybody bought it.</p>
<p>Flu deaths are gone because people are wearing masks!</p>

        <p>I finally hit the point where I tell people I don't care about restrictions on my personal life because I don't intend to follow them.  We will be celebrating all major holidays as an extended family.  I have a group of friends over each week.  I will not comply.</p>
<p>In response, somebody told me that I was the reason we have to go back to lockdowns.  I said, no, sorry, not buying it.  You cannot guilt me anymore.  You cannot make me care anymore.</p>
<p>It's incredibly liberating to say that out loud or to shut down some busybody's social media chirping at you.  I don't care.  I won't comply.  The end.  Conversation over.  They only have as much power over you as you give them.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I mean.  Just imagine all the minor little colds and stomach bugs that have gone around since March that they have had no exposure to?  I have a grandtoddler that lives under our roof, I work with the public and am a 'necessary' worker, my daughter is. My husband is. My son is.  We've all went to work every single day. </p>
<p>We have livestock.  We have cats, dogs, chickens... fences to work on, yard to mow, shit to do outside - so if we're not at the office, we're outside feeding cows and horses, treating injuries, deworming, putting out salt blocks and hay bales... we don't have time to be sick, and we don't have the dubious 'luxury' of walling ourselves from the world and hiding.</p>
<p>And we wouldn't want to anyway... and our immune systems reflect that.</p>

        <p>If you haven't noticed, most maskers and lockdowners are middle-class urbanites/suburbanites who have little personal experience with death. When someone is deathly ill or fatally wounded, they're swiftly swept away to go die in the bright white land of Hospital. There is no dying at home or out in the field for these people. Most of them haven't lost loved ones, or if they have, they haven't watched anyone die. It sure as hell isn't a good feeling, but you eventually come to terms with the fact that death is as normal and natural as birth. All that lovely "circle of life" shit.</p>

        <p>&rt; Ex's wife tested positive yesterday.</p>
<p>She probably didn't though. They're running the PCR test to 40 and even 45 cycles, which is producing false positives.  The test instructions say not take it past 30.  What's happening is that, in order to detect these minute quantities of viral DNA, they have to amplify them using a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR.)  Past 30 amplification cycles, the results are too distorted to be accurate.</p>

        <p>Because people aren't following those mandates. I know a guy who's currently really sick and is covid positive. According to the doctors hes only got mild symptoms but thats just because he isn't dead but anywho hes barely 40 and has no problems with his body aka hes not immune compromised. </p>
<p>He didn't care for masks or sanitation, he wasn't careful at all. No wearing a mask probably wouldn't have made a notable difference, that's a fact but another fact is that if he didn't have symptoms he'd be spreading it around without realizing. 1 person can spread something to a ton of people. Its not 1 to 1. Its a simple fact that masks do stop most illnesses from spreading. When  spittle comes out from talking its not like the covid would fly out of the saliva and into the air. Its in the saliva, it gets caught in the mask. Yeah its not perfect but its better than nothing. I've seen so many videos of anti maskers spraying a mist bottle "through" a mask and if you look, almost nothing actually comes through the mask. It all pours out the bottom. </p>
<p>With that being said if 100 people were in a town, 15 were anti mask. Even if only 5 of those 15 got infected they could easily each infect 15-20 people each. No I'm not saying everyone in the town would die, so don't twist my words but the fact of the matter is, these mandates can only work if literally everyone listened.</p>
<p>I don't understand why anti maskers who claim taking all these precautions are useless don't just do it anyways, one of two things could happen. The virus could go away within a month or two and you people could get all your freedoms back or if it literally doesn't make a difference and anti maskers were right all along, your numbers would grow. You'd have way more people on your side. It would be pretty fishy if literally everyone followed the mandates perfectly and nothing changed. That would be such a strong power move on your end. The only thing that could come out of my proposition/idea would be a win/win for everyone. </p>
<p>I'm not here to argue with you or anyone z just giving an honest explanation. You haven't been rude, disrespectful or unreasonable so I have no reason to be those things either. Although we may disagree on a lot of things I respect the fact that you didn't attempt to attack or insult me, you made an honest approach. I also apologize if this reply came off as lecturing or rude, that was not my intention. Its something I've been working on based on people's feedback.</p>

        <p>We've been wearing masks since May. Compliance where I live has been through the roof. Cases keep growing. Death rates are down to flu-season level rates, but still, everything must be locked down! People cannot get together! (Exception: leftwing rioting.)</p>
<p>You don't understand why people don't want to wear masks even though all the relevant studies show they don't work? They're dirty, uncomfortable, look stupid, prevent you from breathing fresh air, from being able to communicate easily as you're muffled, from accurately reading facial expressions, which are an important part of communication, are torture for people with a number of non-infectious breathing conditions, and make you look like a COVIDiot slave.</p>

        <p>The majority of what you said is factually incorrect. Combining common sense and some quick google searches would immediately reveal that you are objectively stupid.</p>
<p>Cases keep growing because, not everyone is taking precautions. They dont limit you frol breathing fresh air at all, can actually make it better when your not breathing in dust and particles. And with all that the term covidiot was made exclusively for dumbasses like you. </p>
<p>No legit study actually proves masks to be ineffective, every study you dumbasses have linked me go into how if someone with covid coughs on you, you will still probably get infected but none of those studies actually go into the fact that if someone with covid wore a mask and coughed towards you the shit wouldn't even get near you let alone out the mask. </p>
<p>So keep calling me wrong without a single shred of evidence to back yourself up. Come on.</p>

        <p>False. Also, you obviously haven't read the studies referenced in the article "Masks Don't Work." Since you're not scientifically inclined, maybe you should look up the videos of the people vaping while wearing masks. The vapor escapes in giant puffs above, below, and sideways, entering the air all around them and dispersing and would be carrying the virus if it were contained within. Their exhalations are not trapped in the mask, as COVIDiots seem to think they are.</p>

        <p>Yes, gases get through but vape smoke isn't saliva blobs flying through the air. You can breathe through a mask because air and gases can travel through jesus christ. Maybe its you who isnt scientifically inclined, hmm.</p>

        <p>The tiny virus flies through the much larger weave of the mask. The mask stops surgeons from sneezing into the open body cavities of the patients they're operating on. It doesn't keep their exhalations from filling the air around them. Thinking a mask is protecting you from a virus is like thinking you're protected from everyone peeing in the pool because you're all wearing bathing suits.</p>

        <p>Maybe you should try something simple, you know, look up some videos, statistics and whatnot and add a dash of common sense and you'll find a real conclusion. </p>
<p>I don't live in fear, that's something you people keep saying and its genuinely funny. You are purely entertainment, that's apparently all that your life will amount to. Entertainment for a few people on the internet. I don't even understand how or why you people keep bringing up fear, its like you're self projecting. I don't live in fear because thankfully the majority of the people on the planet aren't self absorbed, selfish, deranged, facebook back-alley psuedoscientists. If anything I just feel sorry for you all. </p>
<p>If its a simple fact why not teach me? Maybe because you dont actually know, you just fear being wrong so badly that you have to act like a total dickhead just to feel slightly less insecure about yourself. </p>
<p>Please I want to hear your thought process, there isn't a point in you trying to insult me or whatever you're trying to do to fuel your ego. It doesn't affect me or anyone in the way you think it does. It just makes you look like a screaming monkey in a cage, although instead of monkey noises somehow you learned a few words and are spewing them out in random formations and since you know those few words you think that you are so amazing and so incredibly smart. Having the ability to speak doesn't make you intelligent. </p>
<p>Now in all seriousness, come on throw all your evidence at me. Calling it proof would be very bold and most would say <em>incredibly stupid</em>. I have no reason to believe a single thing you say unless if you can prove me wrong. Its a super simple idea, learn it. </p>
<p>You're correct, once something is true it can't be untrue. Thank you for agreeing with me.</p>

        <p>Except most people actually ARE complying. And according to the lockdowners, some compliance is better than no compliance, so I highly doubt us dissident minority are really holding up progress against this oh-so-deadly cold. The only thing any mandates or restrictions have accomplished is MAYBE procrastinating the inevitable, and we all know - or SHOULD know - how procrastination past a certain point only makes everything worse.</p>

        <p>The last 5 years have gotten progressively worse. People dont have to agree but now people genuinely feel hatred towards strangers because they dont agree. Social media, elections and just general manipulation. Anybody who is half bothering to pay attention can notice the change.</p>

        <p>Even worse, they feel hatred against FAMILY. My daughter has had cousins say that they don't understand how she turned out the way she did and completely disparage both of us just bc she doesn't buy into the bs. In a way, it's good - She's learned how to argue a point and stand up for what SHE thinks. Many young people in this day can't do that - they're so manipulated and controlled by people in social media not liking them.</p>
