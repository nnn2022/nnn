    <strong>One of the Things That Drives me the Most Crazy is the Sanctimonious Unquestioning Belief That Lockdowns Are the Right Public Policy Decision</strong>
    <p><p>I got into another stupid back and forth on Facebook because I am a glutton for punishment. And while I don't believe lockdowns work, especially the way their being mandated now, I can at least say I am not sure what exactly is the right solution just that this half lockdown policy isn't it. </p>
<p>And so, because I thought maybe just maybe I could have a nuanced discussion I asked if they were 100% sure that the lockdowns were the right policy decision. And of course, there was complete, unwavering, unquestioning affirmation that this is not the wrong policy in anyway. </p>
<p>The overdoses, the continued spread of the disease, the destruction of small businesses and even the deaths from Covid that would seem to indicate this isn't working any better than no policy and yet of course, all I got back was their unassailable march towards doom.   </p>

        <p>One way I've found to cope with this nonsense is malicious compliance. Do it wherever you can get away with it. Break all these nonsensical lockdown rules whenever you can get away with it. End of the day preserving a sense of agency in yourself matters more for your sanity than proving others wrong.</p>

        <p>Malicious compliance, is over compliance to rule and regulations. eg. wearing a full hazmat suit or gas mask where only a cloth is needed. It's about being as obnoxious as possible while still being "street legal".</p>
<p>What you describe is a much more dangerous phenomenon that I have witnessed with myself as well. It denotes a complete breakdown of the societal fabric. It denotes a complete lost of trust and belief in a social contract.</p>

        <p>Nah. There are other ways to do it too.</p>
<p>Wear a mask in public? Sure. But what if I'm busy eating and drinking whilst walking about? Ahh... Best way to not feel stifled by constant mask wearing is constant sipping of drinks or eating food whilst out and about. Nobody can say anything about it. And you can't be booked for it. Because you have your mask with you... But you're doing something that's allowed to be done in public and can't be done with a mask on. </p>
<p>Another simple way is wearing a mask but not covering your nose as much as you can get away with. Most people are too busy with their lives and stuff to notice that small difference. I'm wearing a mask for show, but it's not covering my nose entirely so... </p>
<p>Finally, this applies for where I live (SG). Right now we are forced to check in and out of any and every public place with QR code scanning for some Safe Entry bullshit where they track your exact timings of visiting a particular place. Sure. I'll check in... But I won't check out. And any check in input that doesn't have a check out corresponding to it is useless for data usage or tracking. Because they might know when I've been somewhere but they won't know how long.</p>
<p>Lots of such small malicious compliance tips and tricks. Just a matter of finding the right opportunities to do them. It's all public health security theatre anyway.</p>

        <p>Maybe the other way? Mask mandate? Here comes my balaclava. Or even a snorkeling mask.</p>

        <p>Well what do you expect? Thanks to Big Tech it's impossible to air dissenting opinions in any forum where they can actually be heard. The sheep are served a fire hose  of daily fearmongering and are actively prevented from receiving contrary information.</p>
