        <p>Lol I am a surgeon so i wear masks that the general public don't have access too. They have nothing to do with the sheets and the cotton/polyester ones that most people wear. That's why i laught at those masks because people like to compare the ones health workers wear to theirs,but it is not the same at all. Do you really think i would risk to perform a medical act on a patient with a diy mask that protect at most at 40% ? No way. So why is that percentage acceptable for such a "deadly" disease ?  Why not provide the N99 for everybody then ? </p>
<p>You can sleep peacefully knowing that yes i wear a mask everywhere. It is mandatory everywhere since last summer,if we like it or not we cannot pass the control point without it. We can get thousands of dollars worth of fine if we don't. </p>
<p>Do you know what i noticed ? That most people do not wear it properly,they don't follow the right protocol because nobody thought them how to do it. Which makes them pretty useless. </p>
<p>Before last year we didn't wear masks all day long and people didn't get sicker and between you and me,is there a place more prone to catch diseases than a hospital ?</p>

        <p>Yes obviously. </p>
<p>I never denied covid i believe in the virus and i got it myself. 
What i am saying is that our reality as health workers at work has nothing to do with what they are showing on mainstream medias and i have all the reasons to  believe that the governement isn't well intentioned and that covid is just a scapegoat for the great reset and this is NOT a conspiracy theory,Justin Trudeau my prime minister said it himself.</p>
<p>Think about it,the economy is screwed so there's no going back to normal. That's why they have a plan.</p>

        <p>Hey i agree, the cloth masks are shit, but thats what the CDC recommends. Maybe part of the reason were in such a bad state?</p>
<p>The only reason they reatricted public usage of n99/n95/kn95/etc. is to ensure first responders and essential healthcare workers had them. </p>

        <p>the masks that aren't functioning, going by your own admissions, would include all cloth masks in addition to the medical grade masks that are worn improperly. Actually, if what I'm hearing is true, even the medical grade masks are only effective in protecting the wearer, and they have little or no use in protecting others nearby from virus transmission. In other words, the ire you are directing at people for not wearing masks would be just as appropriately directed at every other person wearing masks. (Maybe you can work out some shit like that before you start talking about dunce caps?)</p>

        <p>Are you so afraid of death that you think it gives you the right to tell someone else what to do?  Well let me smack you right upside the head with a cluebyfour.  YOU ARE GOING TO DIE.  I know shocking right?  I'm going to die and probably before I'm 70.  TBH I'm not planning on making it to 60 and I'm 56.  Death is inevitable.  Nobody escapes it.  But what we do and how we live is what we are remembered for.  I, personally, would like to be remembered as a person who embraced life and genuinely tried to make the lives of people around me better.  Okay you want to wear a mask and self isolate?  Thats cool.  Can I drop some groceries off for you?  I'm not going to mock you or make fun of you. Just because I don't agree with your life choices doesn't mean I don't care.  It just means I think you're being foolish and panicky. Hell same thing with my hyperconservative Trump humping family. They're convinced that when Biden takes office they're going to lose their investments.  I just sit here going 'riiiigggghhhttt'.  So I'm investigating bit coin for them   PANIC serves no purpose.  What you and your ilk are doing is listening to the gloom and doom on the news and social media instead of thinking for yourselves and actually studying and figuring out that the likelihood of you dying from this disease is somewhere between 'slim' and 'none'.  If I catch it and it causes secondary problems that eventually kill me.  Well the world will little note nor long remember my passing.  Why the hell are yall all afraid of death?  Or just being sick for two weeks?  I'd rather have a weekend of crazy assed fun and be sick for two weeks than living in a bubble.  I simply do not get the mentality.  Life is meant to be LIVED not something to be afraid of.  I'd say if you leave your house you run the risk of dying or serious personal injury.  But even in your own home you run the same risks.  I'm not saying be stupid in the 'hold my beer and watch this' vein but I am saying taking a risk with a 'disease' that has a pretty good survival rate is way better than just 'dying' for what a year, maybe two, maybe three. Personally I've got better things to fear.  </p>
<p>Still aint wearing a mask if I'm not on the clock and do try to make me.  :)   I'm bored and could use some entertainment.</p>

        <p>If you think ‘wearing a mask’ is the only sacrifice anyone had to make due to these lockdowns then you are a privileged little shit. People are against the lock downs because millions of hard working people have had their entire careers, their life’s work in some cases, literally stolen from them by the government so that your grandma can feel safe at Walmart.</p>

        <p>The average IQ of the US in the early 1990s was about 100.  I'd imagine it has severely dropped since then.  100 is nothing to brag about as it is.  Read the Bell Curve.  Interesting study.  But of course a banned book these days.</p>

        <p>Uh... the push to make smoking cigarettes and eating crappy food socially unacceptable has been in full swing for the past decade or two. And the types of mental health issues underlying suicide have been in the spotlight for the past few years. And cancer research is one of the most popular fields to receive charitable donations. <em>And</em> support for military involvement in foreign nations is at the lowest it's been in the past 20 years.

        <p>&rt;And the types of mental health issues underlying suicide have been in the spotlight for the past few years.</p>
<p>They absolutely haven't, it's trivialised the hell out of mental illness till people think clinical depression is equivalent to a sitiuational feeling a bit down that can be fixed by taking a bubble bath. There's nothing that's really about depression, and nothing at all about other mental illnesses. It's possible Anglophone 'suicide preventation' is particulary backward given more complex and non-patronising 'Dignitas' approach, but I'm not sure. I do know you can beg for help here -UK-, even while in an unsafe home situaton, and not get it. Practical help to make life tolerable is also near entirely absent, with the precise oppositite being prevalent. At this point, given psychology's abusive history and present, I don't believe it was an accident: it serves to depathologise mental illness while pathologising people's normal and valid emotions, especially those around valid disatisfaction with an oppressive status quo. It makes them, not the srystem, the problem. And there's an absolute refusal to listen to all the patients who are telling and telling them this doesn't work, it's not helping. CBT is so often just gaslighting.</p>
<p>There isn't enough actual help for addiction, either.</p>

        <p>no, he's getting downvoted because his comparison is absurd. If cigarette death counts were broadcasted daily on the news, followed by a ban on cigarette sales and cops tasering anyone smoking, he might have a better argument.</p>

        <p>Well that’s because it’s old news that has been around since decades and can’t fill the news with that and ignore more recent problems and the reason they don’t get banned is because of money that problem is still there and there is a handful of people that are trying to prevent it but they can’t meanwhile covid there is something we can do and is far more recent.</p>

<p>Covid: can spread between people and causes deaths of multiple millions of people. Solution stop the spread by reducing the likelihood of spreading with a lock down. </p>
<p>Cigarette deaths: only depends on if a person decides to smoke one person smoking does not effect a lot of other people. Yet still they try and prevent people smoking. </p>
<p>Obesity: same as smoking in literally every way including the solution. </p>
<p>Cancer: can't spread is person to person and yet still we try and prevent and cure cancer patients. </p>
<p>None of these things are remotely close to the huge scale of covid. Let alone what would you do to "take rights away" to stop any of these things. These things aren't related to covid at all in this sense. This is just bullshit for the sake of bullshit.</p>

        <p>I'm gonna try somthing but it will fail knowing this sub</p>
<p>cigarrette deaths is somthing you have control over and can do something about but yet neglecting morons still smoke and die from it and other people are not affected by it (or if you just hate smoke) .</p>
<p>obesity is an eating problem which you have medical treatment and advice for to help yourself with and you yourself have control over since no one is shoving food down your throat but again neglecting idiots will not take it and die from obesity and no one has a problem with it.</p>
<p>cancer deaths is somthing you do not have control over but it's far more rare to get then having an worldwide spreading virus and other people can't get infected and have a problem with it if you have cancer.</p>
<p>Diabetes is pretty much like the same i talked about with obesity </p>
<p>the flu is an tricky one but it's not quite deadly for old people compared with corona and is far less rare then corona and you can recover quite fast from it too so yes it is an sickness but far less worse then the virus we have right now</p>
<p>starvation was always an problem but it's something we have control over and we can change, with corona there is nothing we can do other then taking some actions to get rid of it and that is the  truth but it's not forever and it will never be and i know it's kind of down to not go out with other people and socialize but if it never gets under control it won't change, you will do the same thing over over and over again hoping for a change hoping for freedom of this nightmare but what there really is going on here is that you're fighting against an virus that is impossible to defeat if it gets more chances, those actions are not make you feel any grounded it's trying to get rid of this nightmare and that includes lockdown, social distancing , masks but it's all to try to make it better and fighting against that won't have any positive outcome.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>for war is again somthing we goverments have control over but are still trying to insist on it which i'm gonna admit deserves more attention the corona because of how horrible it is and there were some restictions you also had to take because of it but it was all of the safety of the people.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>suicide is somthing we can help trough each other and therapy and we should also care about but keeping this nightmare going won't stop it either and will rather increase the rates for how long we have to stay in this state.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Medical error deaths are full fault of doctors who were irresponsible with their patients and are definetly getting consequences for their actions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>All im saying is that i do understand your points and i try to make sense of them too but i just don't see how keeping this train going will get us anywhere and make any good out of it</p>
<p>I'm not angry, i don't want you to be angry </p>
<p>i just also want some people to understand points from the other side</p>
<p>Have an good day</p>

        <p>According to the actual stats healthy people don't die from Covid.... Using your logic I can say that obese people have control over their eating habits, hence they have control over dying from covid or not ? Obese people are 6 times more likely to die form covid.   </p>
<p>We don't really have control over suicide when the government is forcing you into lockdown. Zoom therapy is not miraculous. Let's be honest, nobody care about mental health issues in 2021. </p>
<p>I don't see how enforcing lockdowns for months to be sure that no one die from covid while the society is breaking apart will get us out of this either.</p>

        <p>I find dying from it not the problem and  if no one died from it i too wouldn't see a problem but it's still an virus it can still infect other people and just because your not dead does not say you are always going to be fit and healthy immediatly afterwards, it's not only about people dying it's also about what you are going to do when you have it: staying in bed, wearing an face mask, staying in lockdown and more which is why yes the death rate is not a big deal but the infection rate is</p>
<p>And for the suicide rates is somthing not many people even the goverment can do somthing about in terms with this pandemic but as still you can talk to people even if it is far away or you cannot get in physical contact with them which is quite good for help enough but it has always been like this and people do still charity events for other causes like suicide treatment.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>maybe the dying part of covid is not the big deal but since it's still a virus that you just cannot get rid of without all working together it will just not stop</p>

        <p>Well I would agree if only infected people would wear a mask or quarantine themselves. I got the flu several times in my life and I stayed at home ... At the moment healthy people are wearing a mask and are in lockdown. That's the whole problems of the covid measures, and that's why that subreddit exists and more and more people want to end lockdowns.</p>

        <p>So you are basically saying that people have control over the facts that they are freaking fat and develop many problems because they are not able to take care of their health, being fat, not exercising or bad consumption habits, then we have to fuck our life for them when something like covid happens. It suddenly becomes a national issue instead of being  individual responsibilities. This is the kind of (younger) people that die from covid.  </p>
<p>Then we have most of the covid deaths related to old people not able to feed themselves. We place them in shitty environment, then they die from covid because you know, that's what happen when you're 85 years old. At this age you can get a urinary tract infection and you have a high probability of dying. It's sad, but I would never ask people to stop living because I'm afraid of dying.  </p>
<p>So... where is the justification to give up our rights and freedoms exactly? Or course people don't understand in this sub, because there is no valid reason to do so, and the meme is all about this.</p>

        <p>&rt;    i just also want some people to understand points from the other side</p>
<p>The problem is the “points from the other side” are erroneous.   Masks don’t work.  Lockdowns don’t work.  THAT’S what most of us in here are pissed off about.   It’s irrational thinking borne from a fear of the unknown - nothing more.   Which - hey - if you want to stay locked up in your house and wear a face diaper, go for it.  That’s your choice.  </p>
<p>But don’t force that shit on me, especially when it’s nothing more than theater.</p>
