        <p>Thank you for sharing. I am carrying more than a little anger and resentment towards the police due to their actions this year, but this sort of constructive path is what is needed to rebuild a functional society.</p>

        <p>I have police officers in my family and larger social circle. My family includes a current and a former member of command staff from police forces at different levels. That does not mean my anti-lockdown and government-sceptical friends don’t train/think about  in defensive tactics and tools to use should we find ourselves on the other end of a police officer’s baton or shield. It’s all we can realistically do now together given current restrictions. We also study applicable laws and regulations at our disposal, and potential legal challenges or loopholes in lockdown and associated laws at the local, provincial and federal levels. It’s the love thy neighbour but don’t forget to lock your door principle. The police are agents of the state and as much as they are part of your circle and lives, they will always be and it is your duty, should you want to live in a free society to mitigate that power discrepancy as much as possible, within the bounds of reason and just legal principles.</p>

<p>Wrong. As the video explains quite well, it's not all we can do.</p>
<p>People like yourself who have police officers or soldiers in their social circle can do more than the rest of us, by convincing said individuals to step down when contronted with victimless crimes.</p>
<p>People like yourself have the potential to convert police officers and soldiers so that when the police or military turns against its citizens, these people will choose our side and refuse to use violence against citizens fighting for their freedom against encroaching totalitarianism?</p>
<p>The goal of the "Thick Red Line" project is to get as many police offices as possible to join our side and stand up against tyranny rather than operate as its accomplices!</p>

        <p>A state can always pay its enforcers with money borrowed against the regular person’s tax dollars. Say 10,000 police or soldiers resign in solidarity with us against tyranny. The state hires 10,000 more people willing to take its money. This can go on to the point of the state using foreign private mercenaries to enforce its laws. This happened with the Phoenicians of Carthage, the Italian city states of the Renaissance and now in jurisdictions as supposedly free as the Canadian province of Manitoba, which hired private security forces last week to help enforce lockdowns. Another example this year was Belarus, police still tortured and killed while their citizens protested and other police turned against the government. The only counterbalance to the state are regular citizens, those can include police, but converting them or having them on our side is ahistorical. May I suggest reading A Paradise Built in Hell by Solnit for more examples of my point.</p>

        <p>I agree I hate this idea of cops and citizens as being each other’s enemy. They work for us. When they don’t have a uniform on, they <em>are</em> us. Their job is to keep law and order. We really are all on the same side. Say hello to a cop today. You never know, it might make the world a better place.</p>

        <p>That's exactly the goal the "Third Red Line" is trying to achieve.</p>
<p>They're engaging in acts of civil disobedience and using that as one of several methods to recruit police officers for their movement... which is a movement that encourages police officers to not engage when victimless "crimes" are being "commited".</p>
<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJqNQ0Nu_44&amp;t=3s">the video I linked to</a> for details...</p>

        <p>Everyone of us who has police officers, soldiers, bureaucrats or others who are facilitating "the system" professionally among their family or friends can contribute to making this work by talking with these people and demonstrating to them why they are serving (to use Star Wars speak) the Empire rather than the Republic... and why when the time is right their civil disobedience is essential in our collective struggle for freedom.</p>

<p>The vast bulk of those who are being brutalized by the police are non-whites. Period.</p>

<p>Maybe that's because the vast majority of petty criminals are non-white?</p>
<p>Maybe that's because the vast majority of people resisting arrest are non-white?</p>
<p>If true that the  vast bulk of those who are being brutalized by the police are non-whites (for which your provided no evidence), there's still multiple explanations for this that do not involve racism.</p>
