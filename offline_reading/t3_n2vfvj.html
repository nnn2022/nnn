    <strong>I remember every vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>I remember every vaccine that I took in my life. None of them ever gave me any sideeffect beside a sore arm because of the injection. I even got a vaccine against ticks, these little insects in summer that could harm you if they bite you. Now I dont know if that was a good idea or not, but I did it when I was young and when I got told to do so. </p>
<p>So I'm browsing that covidvaccinated subreddit, and what I'm reading there doesnt seem to be anything I have ever experienced through a vaccine. They get literally sick from it and some say "that means the vaccine is working" what the hell is it working? Working to short your lifespan?</p>
<p>Now the most recent thing that I was seeing. Im following a twitchstreamer everyday. I just enjoy the content and Im a longtime supporter. This person got its first vaccine. Joking about receiving 5G and stuff like that, only in other moments where he grabs his chest because he feels sharp pain and starts to exhale deeply.<br>
And it comes and goes. I have never seen him like that, he also looked  extremely pale. Like a corpse.<br>
Now this was friday, honestly I dont know how hes doing now because hes not streaming on weekends.<br>
So I got to see right infront of me what is happening to a person after receiving this vaccine.</p>
<p>But this is not the only thing I'm aware of now, I'm aware how all of this is staged, manipulated and pushed artificially. Its all signaling a redflag and that I should not do anything they tell me and what others (familymembers / friends /coworkers) tell me to do.<br>
In these moments I believe that this is like war.<br>
If you dont use all your instincts and be aware of whats going on, you shouldnt trust your ally who is dumber than you, to follow him. Thats how most of the people have no success in life or die because they listen to other people who are less intelligent and aware. This is now a lot about self confidence and facts.   </p>
<p>The government and the richest people/foundations have performed many times a training where they simulated to the maximum reality, all these moving agendas. It began already with terrorism in america, where they blew up their own buildings to set people in fear about terrorism. Only to find a reason to make the next military movement.  Then they decided to do it with bioterrorism. We had swineflu, that kinda failed I think. Now covid. For covid they prepared really hard, thats why its working so well.<br>
They are prepared to lie to the camera, they know exactly how to answer to any question. <br>
Its always something happens when nobody expects anything. People live in peace, nothing terrible happens. THEN BOOM! suddeny big negative news hit. everybody is shocked.<br>
And this is always fishy to me. How can JUST SOMETHING happen out of nowhere?</p>
<p>The Red Flags:<br>
We have this imaginary virus now that JUST popped out of nowhere and started killing people.<br>
All countries do the same things at the same time, like from a script. <br>
Everyone forces you to take the vaccine. I mean, if we know its killing people, why force me to take it?<br>
I will be able to take it myself if I believe im in danger, I dont need anyone to tell me. <br>
If your vaccine works, you dont need to worry about the unvaccinated.<br>
I havent anyone seen making drama about Tetanus, which is literally everywhere you can get it from.<br>
Thats a real deadly thing if you dont vaccinate yourself against. <br>
We have these rediculous curfews at night. Why at night? Nobody is going outside in the middle of the night, especially if all bars etc. are closed?<br>
So now is the question, what are they doing at night? Clearing the homeless? Setting up something so nobody sees?<br>
We have mask wearing. If youre not sick of anything, why wearing a mask? Shouldnt the ill wear masks? <br>
Why not promoting vitamins? Vitamin D especially? <br>
I used to work close with bioscientiest (even before covid), and they said that VitaminD is the ultimate thing to almost never get sick or inflammations. I do take it from time to time, I cant remember when I was sick the last time. <br>
Why do I have to wakeup and go to bed with the same news on loop? I'm not stupid, if you mention it a few times its okay, but on a loop 24/7 looks to me like a deep propaganda.   </p>
<p>Now most of the people that I ask why they wanna get the vaccine. Just the "why?"<br>
Their answer is: so I  can go on vacation, meet my friends, go to bars<br>
Ok. That means, someone took your human right to be free, and now you feel like you can get it back, by getting the shot. That's 1st: not the reason one should get a vaccine. 2nd: thats a bad trade.  </p>
<p>So why these endless lockdowns? So people will exactly feel exhausted and to get the feeling of <br>
'i cant do this anymore, I want my life back' and just like this you can get it back by a vaccine?<br>
So if this vaccine is really there to depopulate the earth and lower your lifespan or the ability to reproduce or maybe both, is it worth it that you can go on vacation this summer?<br>
Maybe its worth it to stay in quarantine and survive like the ultimate survivalist, only then to get your life back? <br>
I honestly rather stay 2 more years in lockdown, I dont need bars, I dont need to go out. But if this can extend my lifespan instead of shorting it with a vaccine because I wanted my fun earlier, then its worth it. Aye even if I wont be able to work or afford my rent. The nature is free. I know how to survive in the wild. And I'm not afraid of it. It could probably give me the REAL life back. The real thing to feel what is it like to be alive, instead of this standby working everyday payheck to paycheck and feel like an NPC in a video game and be around grumpy people that just hate their life.  </p>
<p>When the goal is reached of these guys that pushed this chaos, then this imaginary virus will just disappear like it was never mentioned. I wonder if the covidpassports  will still be a thing, or be thrown down by the people. <br>
So I have my reasons not to follow that and Im also not trying anyone to convince to do the same.<br>
I have seen that this backfires and that creates a lot of hate that I dont need. Everyone must know for himself what the best decision is. If you dont have time to educate yourself, to read, to find whats going on. And rather use your time for entertainment purposes. Then it is your decision.<br>
In the end only the strongest will survive, that is the nature. The nature is brutal and its meant to be. And has never changed. The animals are showing us the true nature. We humans, are just a bit more intelligent, but also way more corrupt than an animal can ever be. Corrupt through emotions, corrupt through power &amp; money.</p></p>

        <p>inb4 TL;DR</p>
<p>Your overarching concerns resonate well with this sub. There is a bunch'a bullshit going around with the Covid-19 narrative for us all to try and make heads or tails of.</p>
<p>As a Libertarian, I respect people's rights to be concerned and have commiserated frequently with my loved ones and coworkers on the matter. At the end of the day, I feel blessed that those in my life afford me the personal choice to refuse it without repercussion.</p>
<p>Prayers go out to those willing to participate in this broad scale trial of these mRNA vaccines. I hope it doesn't harm them as I feel is a possibility.</p>
