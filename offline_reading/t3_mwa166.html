    <strong>New Chinese Century: How Corona Was a Globalist Suez Moment for The West</strong>
    <p><p>My hypothesis is that’s a vaccine induced die off will not cause any economic collapse. </p>
<p>Let’s look at it from the perspective of the rulers. From their eyes they are overseeing a giant farm full of resources that, to them, is a God given right that was earned by their bloodlines and ancestors. </p>
<p>What they see right now especially in North America and Western Europe is a bloated unproductive population. We do not produce as much as the East and on a per capita basis we consume more than we give.</p>
<p>From a cultural perspective we still uphold virtues such as freedom and self-determination. These very virtues are not present in populations of countries such as China, India, most of Africa or anywhere that is not the west. As we have to them become useless eaters, the population needs a culling as they have no use for us.</p>
<p>We are akin to a flock of sheep who constantly complain about the state of the farm, eat all the grass, and then don’t give them the wool and milk that they need.</p>
<p>So then what would you do with such animals? Well if they’re not going to produce might as well slaughter them and use them for meat.</p>
<p>To do that you do not burn the whole farm you just load up the sheep send them to a factory where they will be cut into pieces to feed the elite. </p>
<p>Now you have a farm that is mostly empty but still productive. The grass starts to re-grow, the fences and pens are still there, the infrastructure is still in place to continue operations. But now you have learned your lesson as a farmer and you don’t buy sheep that question or have high virtues, but import ones that are docile and will constantly produce milk and wool no matter what you feed them or how you treat them.</p>
<p>Case in point are the financial markets and the housing market. Even with a calamitous decline in business and income, the stock market has soared to unseen heights, and the housing market just keeps going up and up and up. Who is buying all the stocks and housing and infrastructure? It is giant hedge funds , pension funds, and family offices of the rich and elite (Such as Old Billy gates buying up a ton of farmland). </p>
<p>There are news articles coming out of the US and Canada where the housing bubble is being propped up, not only by current homeowners, but by pension funds and hedge funds entering the market and gobbling up every piece of real estate that they can lay their hands on. This is not the behaviour of an elite who thinks that there is a worldwide collapse coming.</p>
<p>I am postulating that the vaccine will kill off the native population. Just like the story of the alleged blankets filled with smallpox that killed off the native Indians in the 1800s. </p>
<p>What will be left are giant swaths of empty houses, left over vehicles, and infrastructure that can be readily filled with an incoming population from places like India, China, and Africa, where they are used to living under the thumb of corrupt bureaucrats and dictators.</p>
<p>From a globalist perspective they are just shuffling around human resources as they no longer need us and would rather have a nice docile population that is used to slavery under worldwide control.</p>
<p>So the solution? </p>
<p>Don’t worry about losing your creature comfort’s. Those will still kind of be here. Yes gas prices and food prices may go up, but in total the infrastructure will still be in place. </p>
<p>Instead, start stocking up on food, seeds, medicine, water for the time of transition. </p>
<p>Start immediately building close relationships with like-minded friends and families who know that this whole pandemic is a scam and will not be taking the vaccine. </p>
<p>From there perhaps purchase a piece of land outside of the cities, learn to build housing and plumbing etc. This way you will be safely outside of the kill zones that are inevitably coming and you will have your own supply chains in terms of food and people that you can trust.</p>
<p>“May you live in Interesting Times” was a Chinese curse. Well I guess the elite, through the pivot to China, have cursed the ones who are dependent on their system.</p></p>
