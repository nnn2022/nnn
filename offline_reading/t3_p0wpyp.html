    <strong>I just stumbled on this sub and read the intro</strong>
    <p><p>I don't agree with this subreddit but found the description funny. I have not once been in fear of covid or acted hysterical about it. Do you think everyone who wears a mask or got the vaccine is afraid?</p></p>

        <p>Many are afraid, but most are just compliant. </p>
<p>Humans are social creatures and have a strong tendency to conform to a group even when they know their behavior defies logic, and that’s what’s happening now.</p>

        <p>And to expand on the psychosis of fear, the tactic of keeping a vast majority in a state of fear, and that cannot be denied as those who enforce and conform are so fearful of others who havent or wont, prevents them from realising or thinking critically. Ceases public debate and logic, as the fear is now for two years been hammered into the majority, now its the fear of never returning to “normalacy” because “unvaccinated” individuals wont conform. Incentives being offered as if monetary gain or brief gratification is all it takes for someone to go back on their world view or ideals.</p>
<p>Either you are against this state of fear and coercion, or you are for tyrannical top down oppression.</p>

        <p>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news friend but It was not me that forced this dichotomy of either you are with us or you support tyranny. The fact you have come here calm and curious proves how innocent of this too you are. But the media and the politicians of every country have allowed this narrative to become the law in the letter. 
There is no platform of discussion, the big tech companies censor anyone who speaks against any aspect of covid. The government has restricted the movements of free and healthy citizens and prevented the peaceful protest of any of the laws drummed up under the guise of public health emergency. 
I live in Australia, in Victoria which has been the worst hit with sanctions of freedom to promote a  facade and feigned protection of life, what blows me away is this aspect alone. What government a world over truly cares about its citizens?
If they truly cared about our health and well being then fast food, heavily processed food, fatty foods and most importantly of all alcohol and cigerettes would be banned. 
But a diseases so deadly, the annual death rate of each affected nation hasnt increased compared to yeary averages from influenza, and influenza has all but disappeared, and the reaction is to quarantine healthy unaffected populaces, to pretend they care about your nan and pop, whilst inflicting the worst economic clusterfuck against small businesses and working class, increasing the consumption of alcohol and cigarettes and fast foods due to a reduction in options and lack of freedoms.</p>
<p>Please understand none of us wanted to be on this side of the fence but you cannot truly see your programming whilst living in the echo chamber you are in. Everywhere you look os your version, evidence from paid off scientists and media talking heads backing up your closed off destructive world view.
We are against this on every level. We do not care for your feelings or rules. You, can shove the vaccine up your arse.</p>

        <p>Then why prefix it with event 201?
Why encroach on civil liberties and why give GPs and big pharma complete immunity from side effects? Why the political agenda and the coercion away from freedom of choice, you liberal types scream for a woman’s right to be able to abort a baby at nearly full term but its socially and politically incorrect for people to not want to take an experimental vaccine. Wheres the freedom of opinion, freedom of choice.</p>

        <p>Dude you've read five sentences from me and came up with an entire persona for me. Chill out. You need to take a walk and feed some ducks. You are not a brilliant person who can derive an entire personality from a question and snarky response on reddit. You are a normal schmuck like the rest of us.</p>
