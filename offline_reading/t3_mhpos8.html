    <strong>Feel like I'm going crazy</strong>
    <p><p>sorry for the rant, I know it already is my 2nd one on this sub. I'm also looking for advice if anyone has some.</p>
<p>I'm a 29-yo, French man working in Turkey for a French company. The industry doesn't matter but it is a white-collar job in an office that pays kinda well vs. the Turkish standard. And it is related to food.</p>
<p>Last year, I've lost thousands to an online crook (money I'm never seeing again) and it's taken away any project I would have had. Currently I need to pay back some debt to my bank asap, then start saving again.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I'm giving a little financial, monthly support to my NEET mother and neglecting my own medical needs because my healthcare coverage needs me to advance my fees before refunding me, the healthcare system here is expensive and even harder when I only can seek English-speaking doctors. At least I've got a budget for therapy, but my insurance plan doesn't refund it at all, and the therapist isn't helping much.</p>
<p>I feel utterly miserable. Hasn't had my girlfriend emotionally taken care of me, I would be in shambles even more.</p>
<p>This job man. It wears me down so much.</p>
<p>Now on the covid part. I'm blessed enough that my company doesn't force me to wear the mask during my whole shift. Truly blessed! Turkey enforced it as a rule, meaning if we get a surprise visit from work inspection authorities, they are by law rightful to give tickets. But everyone in the company is willing to take this tiny risk.</p>
<p>What I deeply fear, also is this funny concept of vaccine passport. By no means do I want to take injection, nor receive this digital mark. But I've grown afraid my company or any other employer in my field would force it someday for "hygiene reasons". I patiently wait in anxiety, expecting the worst.</p>
<p>I don't have a crafty approach to work. So far I was the good lil soldier, completed the masters degree and took the white-collar job. I sometimes feel incompetent at it because it requires management and "market reading" skills, which I don't have, and actually despise. I'm all-on technician. But there's really nothing else I know. So I definitely know, taking tuition for an alternative career and losing my current income would hit me hard financially talking. Making me unable to help my mother, to sustain myself, to enjoy the lifestyle I've fended for myself so far. And anyway I'd hate to live with my father or with my mother. Both of them hate each other and are generally demanding to me. I've thought on some paths that are exciting and useful such as plumber, hairdresser, woodworker... But then I remember: my physical fitness is one of a 40-yo man, I'm overweight and I live with 2 herniated discs.</p>
<p>I'm at loss and stuck like a slave. I'm staying in this job by spite, I'm staying in this country for the luxury of seeing my loving partner (and to enjoy some expat privilege), but I can't help having day-nightmares about me and my mother being thrown to the streets for good; or me becoming a corporate zombie with no dreams left whatsoever and a superb vaccine passport that will be forced upon me. One or another is my near-future coming if I don't find a solution. I want to weep. Sorry I'm such a mop.</p></p>

        <p>I posted a similar rant about how I can't trust people anymore. Believe me you are not alone in what you're going through right now. That's all the comfort an internet stranger can give. </p>
<p>When you're going through hell... just keep going. </p>
<p>It's not easy and it isn't fun but we just have to soldier on. </p>
<p>Take care man.</p>
