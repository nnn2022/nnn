    <strong>The MSM is Fake News</strong>
    <p><p>The mainstream media--the propaganda puppet of the ruling class--has been pushing the pseudo-vaccine as hard as it possibly can, after a year of pushing the fear-mongering as hard as it possibly could.</p>
<p>The media HAS reluctantly admitted that yes, there WAS reason to suspect that Covid actually came from a lab funded by the U.S. (by Fauci, in fact). (Never mind that they spent a year demonizing and insulting anyone who suggested such a thing.)</p>
<p>The media is NOT, however, reporting on the massive demonstrations, protests and acts of civil disobedience going on all over the place. But those things are still happening.</p>
<p>The media is NOT focusing on how large percentages of healthcare workers, and people from all sorts of other professions, are refusing to take the pseudo-vaccine. But that is happening.</p>
<p>The media is NOT mentioning how many of the stab-pushing video, reports, ads, and so on, are being barraged by people who are NOT falling for the crap, and are pissed off about it.</p>
<p>The media is NOT focusing on how many people aren't scared anymore--though they did admit that the people who DIDN'T get stabbed are less scared than the ones who already did. (How ironic is that?)</p>
<p>The media doesn't want to talk about how Biden is obviously a demented, unstable creep, but pretty much everyone else knows it. </p>
<p>And the media doesn't focus much on the fact that the mainstream media continues to LOSE readers and viewers, because more and more people KNOW that they're spewing biased propaganda bullshit. </p>
<p>The punchline is, if you watch and believe the mainstream media, you will probably be depressed and frustrated. If, on the other hand, you watch THE REAL WORLD, you will see that the ruling class and its propaganda arm are losing their grip all over the place.</p>

        <p>I think, everybody agree with that deep inside. Problem is we can't have Real News, our options are Fake News and Rumors.</p>

        <p>My impression too, outside things are pretty cool. Hanging out near a construction store yesterday, there is a testing tent, gotta go through there first. Looking around found some rather conspicuous melee weapons - planks with nails from a palette, a cart full of metal instruments inside a locked fence but inside reach.</p>
<p>Media today - emergency state is prolonged at least util end of summer after promising it would end in June (June 31st of course), most people want to keep wearing after pandemic is over. We need to keep the emergency state because the unvaxxed 3rd world would feel it is unfair if we open before them, and we might want to share some of our vaxx with them so our herd immunity might be delayed.</p>
