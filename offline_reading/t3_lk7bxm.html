    <strong>The "New Normal" in Israel</strong>
    <p><p>Hi guys, I've found this sub and wanted to share. Maybe you'll understand me.</p>
<p>English isn't my first language so please bear with me here.</p>
<p>I live in Israel. Since March 2020 we've had three lengthy lockdowns (the last two were motivated more by politics than by the pandemic itself but that's a whole other story). As a result of the constant lockdowns, our economy is completely ruined.</p>
<p>The government signed a contract with Pfizer and is getting the vaccines in exchange for money and also citizens' medical info, so basically our country is a giant experiment for this vaccine. It's obvious that when they sold it, they didn't have all the required information on how it works on different groups, pregnant women for instance. </p>
<p>What's happening now is that the government is basically looking for ways to make vaccination mandatory (they legally can't, but they want to change the laws). Meanwhile, they use the media to divide between the citizens - they say stuff like "people who don't get the vaccine are a danger to society" and a lot of people agree with it and believe the propaganda.  We're divided into "good citizens who got the vaccine" and "horrible people who shouldn't even be citizens because they only think about themselves and don't get vaccinated".</p>
<p>I'm not against vaccines in general, but I'm young and honestly don't think that I need it at this moment. Plus when something is being forced on me, it makes me suspicious. For a good reason, I think. I won't get into all that's been going on, but I'll just say that the government didn't exactly give us any reasons to trust it for the past year. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I just wanted to share. I'm really scared because it seems like our reality is just falling apart and I don't know how far they'll go with this "green passport" and all the incitement against the young people who don't want to get the vaccine (it's mostly young people. Old people and risk groups mostly did get it, which makes the whole thing even more bizarre.)</p></p>

        <p>They are bluffing. They do this in Europe too. Stay strong, you're not alone. </p>
<p>If they do passports most countries I believe will create a seperated society.</p>

        <p>I hope so, I can't even explain properly the anxiety that I'm living with this past year and especially since the whole vaccine situation started.</p>
<p>I've never been more scared, ever. And there are many people who feel like me, but the masses are brainwashed beyond repair at this point. I can't even believe that Israelis, of all people, are so quick to support this. It's really too bad I can't post comments from news sites in Hebrew here, there are so many of them who literally want the government to arrest anyone who doesn't want to get vaccinated (or can't for various health reasons).</p>

        <p>Yeah it's winter now, but we had restrictions during the summer as well. They even closed off the beaches for most of the summer, claiming that the disease can spread in open spaces as well. I mean... total bullshit. </p>
<p>I just hope that they won't pass any new laws or try anything. I don't even know what will happen if they'll try to force people into vaccination, our society will just burst. We're already very divided and everyone hates everyone else (thanks to the government and media).</p>
<p>Thanks for the support, I really appreciate it.</p>

        <p>Netanyahu is trying to use this situation for his benefit, as a part of his election campaign. We're having our fourth general election since 2019 next month and he wants to present himself as the savior of Israel, the one that got us all these vaccines and blah blah blah. Never mind that his mistakes are the ones that got us to this point in the first place, we could've easily been like New Zealand. It's a whole other discussion. </p>

        <p>If I asked someone would they like to go Mars on my space ship that I made in six months, I've tested lots of launches and it is safe. I would expect the next question to be so how many made it to Mars, my answer would be zero they are all still on there way. Most people would then pass. But if I say I don't want a vaccine knocked out in 5months,  tested on a tiny sample, didn't separate the sexes, test on the weak or pregnant and only have three months worth of data saying it is safe, and zero idea of what impact this could have on you in two years (i.e did ya make it to Mars safely) I'm the insane selfish covidiot. And in my example for the young and those who have already have covid you could replace Mars with Earth.</p>

        <p>hello, and stay strong, you too was born in war hungry country, like me. and we have a saying, 'what is being done to palestine, can be done to us. a.  so i get your young frustration. think how those palestinians stay alive despite a war machine mowing them down.   Stay awake too. indeed, the gov. sold you out, pimped you out.   they do that here too in the usa.  all the time.</p>
<p>Remember the Maine!! was the cry in 1899 or so. that was a war bought on a black flag excerise.    those who dont learn from the past, are doom to repeat it.     stock up on vitamin C, A, D and K2.. and take them just before your Nuremburg breaking forced medical experimental concoction.

<p>However to be honest I would totally expect that Israel would react to this as it reacts. Is a sort of a constant militar state. </p>

        <p>Oh, definitely. I love my country, but our society is built on fear. </p>
<p>The same way that the leaders always demonize Arabs or other groups (leftists for instance), they now demonize people who don't get vaccinated. It's the same techniques, and the media is going along with everything the prime minister is saying.</p>
<p>And people here love being in constant panic, they have to have something to fear. That's why Israelis watch the news more than any other nation I think. So now the government can easily scare people into anything, because the foundation is already there.</p>

        <p>Well, In summary for Spain:</p>
<ul>
<li>0€ in help provided to either businesses or families.</li>
<li>Big chefs and charities are giving food to people, queues growing by dozens everyday.</li>
<li>Politicians raised their salaries, as well as the crown salary.</li>
<li>We are with curfews from 9pm to 6am.</li>
<li>Businesses closed.</li>
<li>Thousands have gone under a "help" meassure called ERTE, in which goverment pays half of the wages of people. No payments from the goverment arrived so far.</li>
<li>They started Universal income with 400€ (I guess they haven't tried to live with that lol), media said that only 10k people could access it so far (which I highly doubt).</li>
<li>There are adds on TV about covid, very harsh ones saying that if you don't lockdown you are gonna kill grandma.</li>
<li>All essential medical attention is stopped besides Covid. My father was lucky that he could get a surgical intervetion, 5 days later and he would probably be having complications. He was in the biggest hospital around here and he was alone in the bedroom. Bedrooms next to him were completely empty.</li>
<li>Prices keep rising.</li>
<li>The minister of health here is now trying to get elected as president of Catalonia. I guess the Covid situation is so hard that it can be a part-time job.</li>
<li>Health workers are protesting 24/7 asking for paid extra hours, more staff, more equipment, more material, etc. Yet they only built a 50million hospital, that then became 150million for pandemics and instead of recruiting new people, they forced already employed people to move there.</li>
<li>Media is constantly fearmongering with covid numbers and specials all afternoon long about covid.</li>
<li>Yet somehow "woke" people believe that the goverment cares about them.</li>
</ul>
<p>This pretty much sums it up.</p>

<p>&rt;Politicians raised their salaries, as well as the crown salary. - <strong>same</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;We are with curfews from 9pm to 6am. - <strong>no curfew but we had long lockdowns when we couldn't get further than 1000 meters from our house and many other restrictions. Also, in actual "red zones" where the numbers of covid are high the restrictions aren't enforced because of political reasons. Which is even more frustrating because instead of closing the areas that actually have covid, they punish everyone else just to show that the government is doing something.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Businesses closed. - <strong>yep, some have been closed for the entire year. Others are open between lockdowns.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Thousands have gone under a "help" meassure called ERTE, in which goverment pays half of the wages of people. No payments from the goverment arrived so far. - <strong>we have nearly 1 million unemployed people because of covid and we receive payments until June, but it's a fairly small amount and a lot of people had to move back with their parents because of it. Businesses were supposed to receive money also, but as far as I know not all of them did.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There are adds on TV about covid, very harsh ones saying that if you don't lockdown you are gonna kill grandma. - <strong>same, also a lot of ads for the vaccine now.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;All essential medical attention is stopped besides Covid. My father was lucky that he could get a surgical intervetion, 5 days later and he would probably be having complications. - <strong>my grandad died last September because of complications with a tumor that has returned. He was too scared to go for his regular checkups, because the media always talked about how dangerous it is to even go outside, let alone go to a hospital. I don't know if it would make a difference, but his fear and avoidance of hospitals certainly didn't help him.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Prices keep rising. - <strong>same, constantly.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The minister of health here is now trying to get elected as president of Catalonia. I guess the Covid situation is so hard that it can be a part-time job. - <strong>our minister of health is an ex-con. And an idiot.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Health workers are protesting 24/7 asking for paid extra hours, more staff, more equipment, more material, etc. Yet they only built a 50million hospital, that then became 150million for pandemics and instead of recruiting new people, they forced already employed people to move there. - <strong>the last lockdown cost 3 billion NIS, and some experts said that the government could've built 3 new hospitals for that cost. But they choose to throw money at lockdowns instead of finding other ways to deal with the pandemic.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Media is constantly fearmongering with covid numbers and specials all afternoon long about covid. - <strong>here it's literally 24/7, since March 2020. You can't turn the TV on without hearing about it, like nothing else is happening.</strong></p>

        <p>It’s great you speak up. Not much noise is coming from the Israeli people. But media all over the world is herald Israel. </p>
<p>Can I ask, why are people in Israel  so willingly going along with all of this??? I would have thought that Israeli voices would be the loudest and most prominent in  comparing this to the Holocaust. </p>
<p>Are opposers being silenced?? Or is it like Germany where they are spinning it around that, anyone who voices concern is a Holocaust denier?</p>

        <p>Anyone who's trying to voice other opinions is being silenced. For instance - there was one professor who was interviewed several times and said things that the media usually doesn't voice at all and he was fired from his job. So I guess that many doctors, professors and other experts are afraid to come out and say anything.</p>
<p>Opposers are being labeled as insane conspirators who believe "fake news", or as grandma killers and as a menace to society. Even if you just say that wearing a mask outside doesn't make any sense, you're labeled as a "Coronavirus Denier" (the media LOVES that term, they throw it around constantly).  And yeah, if we don't wear a mask outside we can get fined. </p>
<p>Facebook is closing groups and pages that post anything against the green passport initiative, so there's no way for free thinkers to unite over this subject. Most people who think like me prefer not to discuss this matter IRL because they don't want to get ostracized.</p>
<p>I honestly have no idea why people are going along with this, most of the people here are just very very dumb I guess. It's a result of many years of neglecting the education system. Zero ability to think for themselves.</p>

        <p>I've commented on another thread with another example of how people are acting right now:</p>
