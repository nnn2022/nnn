        <p>&rt;“Data helps, such as 97% of Covid patients in ICU in the USA are unvaccinated. Death rate is one per million from AstraZeneca blood clots.” GP, Melbourne</p>
<p>That is not data/science...it's a known-to-be-false MSM talking point. We've already debunked this myth on this sub!</p>
<p>&rt;“They often say the vaccine development was rushed. I point out that most of the work was already done on SARS-CoV-1 and none of it was rushed. The bureaucracy was sped up but the clinical development was exactly as rigorous as usual.” Lisa</p>
<p>Oh, and how did the ferrets fare?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Hospitals can’t cope with too many people getting sick at the same time. If I don’t get vaccinated and then get sick I will contribute to this possible collapse. If the medical system goes down then everyone suffers. It’s a team effort.” Lindsay, Sydney</p>
<p>The hospitals did not collapse during the 18 months that you were not vaxxed, but you think that there's a possibility now that there's a vaxx?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;“I said, I know how you feel. I was hesitant too, but the thing was I couldn’t stand the thought of being partly responsible for someone’s death.” Beth, Melbourne<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It’s less about protecting yourself than protecting others and making it possible for young people to enjoy the same opportunities as we did to study, travel and work abroad. Also, it’s the only thing that we as individuals can really contribute to ending the crisis.” Jane, Melbourne</p>
<p>And how does a leaky vaxx - which neither prevents transmission nor infection - accomplish that?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;“What worked best to convince my mum was that until we are all vaccinated we will have no choice but to keep going through this frustrating and disruptive cycle of lockdowns.” Rachael, Melbourne<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“They say they will get it when the borders open, so I suggest that perhaps the borders will not open until we have it.” Anonymous, Perth<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“In future she’d not be able to visit relatives in aged care and potentially not be able to get back to restaurants, shows or travel once vaccination passports kick in.” Anonymous, Melbourne</p>
<p>LOL! Let's acquiesce to biofascism so that they can give us the freedoms they stole from us. Sounds like a great idea!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TLDR: Ozzy is in BIG trouble.</p>
