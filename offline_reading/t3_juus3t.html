    <strong>How did so many people so willingly just give up a year of their lives?</strong>
    <p><p>And probably more years to come.</p>
<p>I have been to a few gatherings but overall it's been a shitty, boring, uneventful year and i'm angry as fuck.</p>
<p>Am I being stupid or is it impossible to just isolate those who are vulnerable until there's a vaccine and letting everyone else live like they have pre-2020?</p>
<p>I still don't know a single person who knows a person who knows a person who had the virus, let alone anyone who died from it.</p></p>

        <p>I’ve seen this smug satisfaction many times. “Well I’m a shut-in (either by choice or due to mental or physical illness) so now you all get to live like me. Haha.” or “It’s actually been so relaxing and great working from home in my 5,000 sq ft McMansion and getting to spend more time with my perfect family and work on expensive hobbies as we make essential workers bring us stuff.” Too many people are loving getting to feel virtuous for doing nothing, and I believe governments are using that to manipulate us.</p>

        <p>Exactly. It pisses me off when these smug people working from the comfort of their well-insulated climate controlled homes act so virtuous as people lose their livelihoods. Their response is, "that sucks. but it's worth it for MY safety" while disregarding the millions of people who've lost a shit ton of money and are saddled with unpayable debts. 90% of businesses in NYC are behind their rents/mortgages. Millions of people are behind in their rent/mortgages. I guess tough shit for them! It's Trumps fault!   </p>
<p>And yeah,nNot everyone likes being caged-in. We are social creatures. People around the world are getting lockdown fatigue as they feel like caged beasts. Places with strict lockdowns like Spain or Italy are fed up and being are being defiant even though they had the worst outbreaks in the EU with this recent uptick being even worse than the first. Southern europeans are more social and with greater disdain for authority compared  to people from countries like Sweden or Japan, which had few restrictions but no major outbreaks.</p>

        <p>This is exactly what's going to lead to the downfall of us. Due to things like the internet, different people have different ideas, and can't follow through with anything. Honestly, if we just stayed at home a bit, we could've been done with this shit a while ago. I'm pretty damn fed up with being cooped up at hom, but that's no excuse to deliberately try and spread a virus. Because people are not wearing masks and spreading this is causing the economy to collapse. In the 1920's, the Spanish Flu, even though it had a way higher infection rate and mortality rate, was gone in a year with more limited technology, and less money. Why? Because people actually wore masks. Soldiers, citizens, government officials, all wore masks. So, I believe that you're allowed to be fed up, but please wear a mask if you want this to be over.</p>

        <p>Actually, the masks used during the 1918 flu pandemic were a lot less effective than the masks of today. Most of the masks were made of very porous gauze that did little to filter out the virus and many people wore them incorrectly. Plus many soldiers fighting in WWI didn't wear masks and more people died of the flu than the war. That pandemic ended after nearly everyone got the H1N1 flu and developed herd immunity after a year, but with the cost of 675,000 people dying in the US and 50 million globally. With covid, it seems the antibodies leave the body quickly, so herd immunity is unlikely, or that's what I've read so far. We're likely going to have to just live with this virus even with a vaccine. I suppose we can just live in a sort of perpetual lockdown, but is that a life worth living and are the costs of perpetual lockdownn  worth it?</p>
<p>And yes, I've been wearing either a hepa filter or N95 mask whenever I leave my home. I rarely went out until October or so, when I thought things were returning normal, but I suppose many people felt that way too and let their guard down esp on Halloween and Election Day. With how divided the US is, we're screwed because of political gridlock and lack of cohesiveness and cooperation. All this bickering is mental masturbation as far as I'm concerned. I just have to ride this out and adapt as best as I can.</p>

        <p>“Honestly, if we just stayed at home a bit, we could’ve been done with this shit a while ago.”</p>
<p>That’s the myth. Unless you could keep EVERYONE in the world including essential workers and first responders home without leaving even for food or medical care for at least a month (which obvious isn’t feasible and way more people would die from this than COVID), the virus isn’t going anywhere. All that lockdowns can do is slow the spread temporarily. Same with masks. It will always come back, as we’ve seen in counties that had hard lockdowns and “beat” the virus. The only answer is an effective vaccine and/or herd immunity being reached. Don’t get me wrong I wear a mask, but believing that will end this pandemic is just false. Spanish Flu was a different virus and the world was different.</p>

        <p><strong>Please do some research, there is no lasting immunity against this virus, at least not in a natural way, thus the totally perverted pseudo-concept of so called "herd immunity", contrary to successful vaccinations campaigns (from which this term has been "borrowed" with the sole purpose of misappropriating it),  does not apply here in the slightest.</strong></p>

        <p>According to everything I’ve read, we still don’t really know how long immunity to COVID lasts and everything is up in the air regarding herd immunity. Do you have any peer reviewed articles you’d like to share demonstrating that it doesn’t last long enough to create any kind of herd immunity? </p>
<p>Honestly, this comment looks really fishy to me like it’s from a bot or paid agent of some kind.</p>

        <p><strong>T-cell immunity isn't possible when CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells are targeted and killed by SARS-CoV-2.</strong></p>
<p><strong>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00827/full</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is in part why HIV vaccines are ineffective; HIV is a virus that targets CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell receptors. Despite the body recognizing the HIV infection AND producing antibodies (whose presence is the mechanism by which a HIV infection is determined), HIV can replicate and destroy the T-cells. Primary infection is an influenza-like-illness (ILI), which then goes into a latent period for some time. Secondary infection, augmented by Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) obliterates the lymphocytes resulting in AIDS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dengue virus is another which has a complicated behavior with CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells.</strong></p>
<p><strong>https://jvi.asm.org/content/92/10/e02181-17</strong></p>
<p><strong>A primary infection of Dengue Fever is also an ILI, and subsequent infection by a different strain (there are 4) presents ADE and often death.</strong></p>
<p><strong>HIV mutates extremely rapidly has no vaccine, whereas after 90 years of research dengue virus has one as of May 1, 2019.</strong></p>
<p><strong>https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/prevention/dengue-vaccine.html</strong></p>
<p><strong>At this time, lymphocytopenia has been observed in COVID-19 cases with a hypothetical ADE scenario possible. One area of exploration is the D614G mutation, where some individuals may have been infected with both strains (i.e. in Belgium) resulting in ADE and a higher mortality rate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.069054v1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Regarding reinfections, the odds of getting it twice are not low, actually. The way that a case is "confirmed" as a reinfection involves a lot of steps that are quite rare:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1)positive infection test with sample sent for sequencing (this is rare!)
2)negative infection test
3)positive infection test with sample sent for sequencing (again, this is rare!)
4)the two sequences do not match indicating a new, second viral infection</strong></p>
<p><strong>Besides the rarity of an individual having their infections sequenced, twice, there's also the concern about reinfected with the exact same sequence which makes it impossible to rule-out reactivation. Reactivation, if confirmed, would be an ever more concerning problem than reinfection, as it means one cannot clear the virus.</strong></p>

        <p>I think being coddled in comfort has led many people to be much more risk averse than before. People seem to fear death more when coddled. Many people are so frightened of dying from covid that they are willing to forgo much of their freedom and deal with the economy downturn and other consequences of prolonged lockdowns. Furthermore, many of the rabid "STAY THE FUCK HOME" lock down evangelists have the privilege of working in the comfort of their own home. They see numerous businesses shutting as a minor cost that's worth lowering their risk of dying from covid. They have very little sympathy for the people who've lost their livelihoods and left to fend for themselves.</p>

        <p>They don't have the concepts of trade offs. Ie you cannot have a disease free society without massive suffering and degradation of human rights. They think in absolutes where stopping the spread of disease MUST happen.. for some reason. They don't have concepts of quality of life, ie they think a stimulus check can replace human connection or a lost career, or save you from long term poverty or a domestic abuse, or protect your mental health, or stop you from failing online school. They think lockdowns and masks do not lower people's quality of life. </p>
<p>All of this routed in their own privileged life of never having to make tradeoffs, lowering their quality of life, or needing to understand how economics works. Their whole life authority figures have been working for them. They can't imagine a world where there authorities could do wrong.</p>

They are still living their cushy life and haven't been affected severely yet, so the idea of losing their livelihoods or dealing with other seriously crap caused by lockdowns is just theoretical and is a merely inconvenience for them. Which makes it easy for them to think "we must save lives from covid at all costs. We're all making sacrifices together". I've pointed out all the horrible things caused by the lockdowns in a local city sub Reddit, and many went ballistic on me lobbing nasty personal attacks that had nothing to do with the topic. Others blamed the republicans for not passing the 2nd stimulus bill and the state gov't had little choice. I've given up trying to knock some sense in the rabbid lock down evangelists; they're just too far gone.</p>

        <p>You have something here. I'm going to take it a step further and say that my Christian friends tend to be much more willing to accept the (small) risk of death than my non-believer friends. As someone in between those worlds, it makes sense to me.</p>
<p>There has to be some correlation between the worldview of the 25 year old pampered late Millennial/Gen Z atheist and an extreme risk aversion. I have my suspicions that these attitudes are half theological and half of the Ted Kaczynski oversocialization school of thought.</p>

        <p>Their carelessness does not affect your health. It is your responsibility to avoid a virus when the vast majority of people are not affected by it. Human socialization is essential to having a basic quality of life. Same reason primates die in isolation. Asymptomatic transfer is extremely rare according to WHO additionally.

<p>So yeah, great attempt to bring me down. I’m not the one who sits on Reddit and complains that the big mean government is preventing me from living my life. I have found a way to live it in a way that is still fulfilling, yet ensures the safety of those around me. I challenge you to do the same.</p>

        <p>I am so glad you have the luxury of travelling the world while you ask poor people to quarantine in miserable conditions of starvation and abuse, not see their family, miss routine health screens, struggle in online school, lose their job and career, and want fo commit suicide. I am so glad you are fulfilled while they rot in isolation and depression. While gay people and minorities lost their safe space in bars, while people lose their businesses, while women and children are stuck in abusive homes. I am so sorry you miss going out. That makes their sacrifice look small.</p>

        <p>So again, you’re making a lot of assumptions so let me address them. </p>
<p>I am a first generation immigrant born into a communist dictatorship and grew up without access to healthcare or food beyond rations provided by the government. Half of my family still lives there. Believe me when i tell you that I am likely more equipped to understand the struggles that our poor are facing today. </p>
<p>Secondly, who said anything about quarantine? I certainly never did. I said that you should wear a mask at all times when around other people and strive to interact with others outside or in well ventilated areas. </p>
<p>Your last couple sentences are just whining. No one is keeping women and children in abusive homes because of covid. The gay community is thriving. </p>
<p>You sound like a drama queen so let me give you a piece of advice: no one will take you seriously if the only argument you’re capable of making is founded on sensationalism.</p>

        <p>you sensationalize something with a 0.05 IFR for &rt;70 aged people and down to under 0.0005 for most people. The masks promote this fear and paranoia that is causing a great depression that LITERALLY puts ADDITIONAL MILLIONS poor people into poverty who otherwise would not have been poor. These irrational fears are making businesses go under. Taking away institutions like the office and school is a death sentence for people with abusive families. These multiple fold increases aren't my opinion, this is in the Guardian, NYT, webmd, WHO, everyone, they attribute it to covid response. Don't be ignorant. I just decided for myself that these consequences are SICK and not justified. </p>
<p>I am gay and every gay person I know is depressed bc our safe spaces are gone. My Caribbean friends used the club to be with their people and enjoy their culture. Needing to not be apart of your community is valid. </p>
<p>Your entire belief is based on disease fear mongering leading to skyrocketing human rights tragedies, fear mongering that makes the anti terrorist fear mongers look like chums. Millions of people suffered human rights tragedies in Iraq bc of sensationalized anti terrorism propaganda that had the entire American population brainwashed, and now regrets. Congrats being on that side of propaganda again. You are gonna look like an idiot when it's magically not woke anymore to support this, just like every single Iraq War supporter. Good day.</p>

        <p>There isn't a study on earth that proves masks work. And if you find one, it's easy to find many, including from the CDC, that prove they don't. It's impossible to enforce everyone wearing it so it's a stupid goal. If you've been outside a wealthy city or suburb you find 4/5s of people sometimes do not wear them. No way you are gonna get a cop on every corner and it not target poor and minorities. </p>
<p>You cannot stop a pandemic with masks, only herd immunity and vaccines can. There is no where on earth they worked and continued to work after opening up places. It's extremely difficult for deaf and disabled people to use masks. It is difficult for children. It is difficult for those with claustrophobia and some forms of anxiety. They are ableist. They are uncomfortable for a lot of people. The reduce quality of life. They promote disconnection and constant fear. </p>

        <p>Your argument was "everyone's life should change because <em>I</em> had a severe case". No, that's real selfishness, period.</p>
<p>It affected you badly, so you want everyone to look out for you.</p>
<p>No.</p>

        <p>Your last sentence is a logical falicy. </p>
<p>Most people don’t have active filtration mask options like a p100 to filter the air around them. Thus, you not wearing a mask is denying me the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Cotton masks are effective at preventing the user from spewing out water droplets that carry the virus. They are less effective at filtering anything that is already airborne. </p>
<p>It’s for the same reason that we have laws all around us to protect others from ourselves (speed limits, background checks on weapons, etc). </p>
<p>I didn’t ask you to drastically change your life. I asked you to wear a mask and limit your time spent in crowded places with little air circulation. </p>
<p>Are you suggesting that is an unreasonable request? Is your stance that we should continue to live as if nothing has happened and there isn’t a pandemic around us? I’m just trying to understand your whining here, so help me out. </p>
<p>Last thing: I’m not sure why you keep suggesting that I had covid. I haven’t. My friend did. Would you like to reread my original comment again?</p>

        <p>No one worth listening to has supported locking down forever. The premise of this sub is silly.  The only reason we're having any lockdowns now is that people won't distance and wear a mask for a reasonable amount of time. Fucking New Zealand doesn't have a problem because everyone took it seriously right away. If people in this country could just stop being weak little selfish shits and spend a measly 6 weeks doing something for everyone else we'd mostly get through it. Instead of having a year of hell we'd have had a month and a half and both the economy and our lives would have moved on in a dramatic way.</p>
<p>Before you start, yeah, i get that we're pretty different from New Zealand in both population size and density. But we'd make significant gains with just 6 weeks of cooperation. After that restrictions could be far more targeted and most people would have a much easier time. Don't be so selfish. If we'd really taken this seriously for 6 weeks in May we'd be in a far better place right now. Most of this year would have been almost normal.</p>

        <p>You can't completely enforce quarantine. It's an impossible goal. Every country that had more serious lockdowns got more cases the second they opened up. What they did get is massive police states where you could be arrested for eating dinner with your family, and massive amounts of suicide. We are in the same boat as Europe now. Trying to defeat a disease without a vaccine or herd immunity is asinine god complex that leads to massive amounts of human tragedy. You cannot enforce quarantine without a cop on every corner committed to this cause, and we know that would target poor people and minority businesses too. You can't enforce this. And even if you magically could the second you open up you get more cases.</p>

They can be like "aye man, you can pay 1000 dollars for this fridge, OR you can pay 5 dollars a month forever!" And they can contract it out to you and just completely shut it off if you don't keep up with payments. Same goes for any electronic you can think of.   </p>
<p>It'll be the end of property as we know it. Unrestrained capitalism asymptotically approaches communism.</p>

        <p>It's also been happening with software for a good while. Adobe Creative Cloud is a subscription. You can't just buy photoshop and never worry about it again.  </p>
<p>With Bitcoin on the rise it'll become easier to move money around and we'll see this stuff even more.</p>

        <p>Office 365, even Java is subscription now. It's crazy. Almost impossible to 'buy' software nowadays. Also, a lot of places outsource so many services so they don't even have the data onsite. If you try to move to a new service, you get charged for the old one to give you your own data. Welcome to the 'new normal'.</p>

        <p>Yeah personally I hate subscriptions for most things. I also hate forced updates. It usually ends up costing more long-term, and updates are often not objectively better. If it wasn’t profitable, companies wouldn’t do it. It just seems to be the way society is going, and that before too long we’ll have forced updates to our brain software we have to subscribe to to continue living. I know I may sound anti-progress, but I’m not. I’m excited about new technology. I’m anti-extortion and control. I’m also not anti-capitalist generally speaking, but when a handful of companies wield so much power (as tech companies do), the free market doesn’t really function anymore. We’re all slaves to tech.</p>

        <p>I think the vulnerable and afraid can / should isolate if they CHOOSE to. I see so many heartbreaking stories of the elderly who so badly want to be with family and would rather have quality over quantity. I think we should move on with our lives and just be cautious as we usually do by washing hands and staying home if feeling unwell.</p>

        <p>Agreed. We should create isolated spaces for people in high risk categories or anyone )wanting to isolate themselves for whatever reason. We can't keep locking down as cases rise, then reopening after they've lowered below a certain threshold, then locking down again, ad infinitum, or worse remain in lockdown indefinitely until a vaccine is released (which could be in 1 month, 1 decade, or never.) as the economy implodes and social unrest worsens. Even when a vaccine is released, death rates will only drop slightly like with the flu. We've gone past the point where the cure is worse (and worsens) than the disease.</p>

<p>Yep and most people can't. Governments couldn't even give them paid leave, and couldn't even write basic law that gives people right to unpaid leave.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a pregnant lady gets a whole year of paid leave.</p>
<p>This is a scam. We don't protect people who need to be protected.</p>

        <p>I would think that a community could figure out (kinda like how the Amish do) a way to make sure the vulnerable in their neck of the woods were taken care of. I wish it was more like that: communities living and looking out for one another and less big government who is out of touch with reality and inherently corrupt. I am pregnant now.... I was on the deans list to become a paralegal , helping my husbands cabinetry business grow, and taking the kids to/from school. Now I have had to quit my school , homeschool, and I have only been to the office once. It really is hard for everyone I understand ... everyone’s hard is hard :/ but I can’t help but realize this is a horrible horrible plan to continue locking us down and isolating us from one another. Especially the elderly :( and the children from other children .</p>

        <p>I don’t know? How did washing hands and staying away from people when you are experiencing a fever and coughing ever work? Am I “pre-symptomatic” for a flu right now? Maybe! Better stay home and not do anything ever! Am I pre symptom for aids? Yes!!! Staying home :) pre symptomatic for skin cancer? Also yes! Avoiding sun indefinitely.
Since I haven’t been spoon fed that specific regurgitated answer, I mean, information, yet from Fraudci, Guess we should stay home forever and stop living so we can live forever in our homes until we die of old age which will be labeled COVID-53.</p>

        <p>everyone who disagrees with me on the covid stuff never asks me why I think this way or where I drew my conclusions. I was a very scared doomer at first so I understand being upset... but I’ve been called an idiot, selfish, moronic, f-tard, other bad words/names and have even been wished death upon by the people I am trying to point to the truth. Sorry you are so scared and upset. It is misdirected and I have compassion for you.</p>

        <p>You are turning this into "disagrees" as if there are two legitimate viewpoints - accepting science and denying science.</p>
<p>This is an airborne respiratory virus.  It is contagious before anybody knows they are infected.  People are dying, lots of people, thousands of people.  ICUs are overwhelmed.  People that work in ICUs are endangering themselves to care for people like those on this sub who deny reality - then can't believe it happened to them.</p>
<p>You want to live in a bubble of denying facts?  Go ahead. </p>
<p>Just don't seek care when you can't breathe.  Don't go to the store when you are sick and endanger other people.  It's selfish and immature.</p>

        <p>Most people with Covid don’t require hospital treatment. People generally go when they don’t need to, especially due to the fearmongering. Educating the public on how to deal with it at home would help alleviate this somewhat. </p>
<p>And, if your going to say “people who socialise and get Covid don’t deserve hospital treatment”, then you need to take hospital treatment from anyone who’s ever smoked and has lung cancer/other lung diseases. Take hospital treatment away from anyone who has issues due to obesity and doesn’t fix their diet or exercise. Take hospital treatment away from people with cancer who have ever done/eaten something that increases the risk of cancer. Take hospital treatment away from people in vehicle accidents who’ve chosen to get in a vehicle or walk near a road..</p>

        <p>&rt; How old were most of these people?</p>
<p>I don't think that's a relevant question. In any context where it makes sense to ask this question, you're talking to a demographic that is already super high-risk for things that have been around forever, like influenza.</p>
<p>Those people were mostly already taking precautions well before COVID, and if they weren't I don't see how I am expected to feel responsible for their health (or death). I've never been told to act that way towards people who are easily killed by the flu or a cold, and I don't see why COVID is any different.</p>

        <p>I'm happy for you. That doesn't mean anything to me or anyone else. I'm in good health. I can run a sub 6 min mile ( i know thats not fast at all but you gotta be at least half decently in shape to do it). It didn't hit me hard because I'm old or fat or have a pre-existing condition. I'm none of those. It hits people at random. Even Dwayne Johnson said it was rough for him. Just because it didn't do anything shit to you though, doesn't mean everyone shouldn't take it very seriously.</p>

        <p>How is your a1c looking? How about your vit D ? Your selenium and zinc levels? I'd wager you are magnesium deficient as well but there really is no good test for that. Believe it or not low LDL makes infections easier to take hold as well, (viruses, especially corona virus use LDL receptors to enter cells) and doctors actively work toward that as a means to combat heart disease. The point is, you probably had a bad reaction for some clearly defined reason, not because this virus is mysterious.</p>

        <p>That's not what I'm saying. If this really was a "deadly" disease we'd know about it regardless of the news. But covid has a very low death rate, and if I don't even know anyone who had it then there's not exactly a huge disproportionate amount of people dying from it. There aren't people dropping dead in the streets. It's real but it's not that bad.</p>
<p>Plus, this is a bad comparison to make. Victims of rape and slave labor suffer long term effects (mentally). People who get covid usually get sick for like a week and then recover. Just like flu. Not denying we need to offer focused protection to those who need it, but this reaction is far too much.</p>

        <p>Part of the supposedly "low death rate" from covid is that we took steps to address it that are unprecedented for most people's lives (unless they're roughly 100 years old).  It's many times more deadly than the flu despite lockdowns. You're being short sighted.</p>

        <p>&rt;You think it’d not a big deal because you don’t know anyone personally affected? We can all agree this mentality is dumb, right?<br>

&rt;Do you think rape isn’t a big deal because you don’t know any rape victims?</p>
<p>No, I think your mentality is dumb actually. Let's take your example of rape, if we were all on lockdown and everyone's freedoms were restricted to prevent rapes from taking place then it would make sense to point out that you don't know any rape victims and question the prevalence of rape.</p>

None of us support lockdown, and some of those of don’t support it DO include high risk individuals who got fucked by COVID because they value their freedoms and would rather get fucked over by a disease rather than tyrannical, government imposed restrictions.

        <p>That’s the absolute dumbest, most insulting, offensive, and triggering comparison you could possibly make. You clearly not only don’t know any rape victims, but you’re clearly uneducated about the severity of rape if you even think a bad flu comes close to that. I won’t even touch on the child slavery comparison since it’s, frankly, too disgusting to process. </p>
<p>Also, given that 1 in 6 women and 1 in 33 men in the US have been the victim of rape or attempted rape, you probably do know a rape victim, they probably just don’t feel comfortable enough to share that with you. I wonder why...</p>
<p>Stop virtue signaling about a bad flu strain and start thinking about what you type. It’s literally not remotely hard to research the effects of COVID-19 and the effects of rape and connect that they are not remotely in the same league. Child slavery is even worse. Get out of here with your awful, disgusting, uneducated comparisons.</p>

        <p>The echo chambers of conformity has amplified this effect. The consequences of veering even slightly away from the prevailing ideology can be dire, so people are pressured to remaining compliant or risk losing their social status. Many of these pro-lockdown politicians are now posturing to be the wokest of the woke by implementing the most draconian restrictions to win political and woke points.  It's all a game of winning the most woke points. They also realize one small slip up could cause them to lose nearly all their woke points, so they are very careful to go along with whatever the narrative tells them to.</p>

They're hopeful this will all be over when we get the vaccine, but I believe the goal will shift once again to "zero infections" after the vaccine is distributed.</p>

        <p>I still remember, when COVID first came around in April a nutrition and health influencer I follow on Instagram (one of the few sane ones) posted that people are wildly misunderstanding the point of the first lockdown. He explained that if it is as contagious as it appears to be nearly EVERYONE will contract it sooner or later. That it won’t be eradicated by most people staying home for a month. Then he offered advice on strengthening your immune system through natural means. He was immediately obliterated in the comments for how triggering his commentary was, people saying „my anxiety is already so high, how dare you use facts and logic and tell me I will most likely contract this incredibly contagious but mild virus whether I comply with the restrictions or not?!??”. People went bonkers about it, and still do occassionally when he suggests strengthening your immune system as the best means of precaution from the virus. I guess that takes a little more effort than sitting on your ass at home, watching Netflix and wearing a cloth over your face in public, so they don’t wanna hear it.</p>

        <p>Yeah it fucking sucks. Most people didn’t have a choice, though. Can’t really do much when dictator governors close businesses and events. I’d love to protest but idk how they start honestly. I’d love for the US to be more like Europe protesting against tyranny. But most people just go along with it thinking they’re saving lives by wearing their dumb masks and staying at home. It’s really disheartening</p>

        <p>What I don't like is how there are so many people who <em>still</em> haven't learned to have fun with themselves.</p>
<p>I learned that skill years ago &amp; took up several hobbies. This skill is why I've actually had a great year in 2020. I made investments long ago with things like a mountain bike, golf discs, fishing supplies, backpacks, foraging tools, etc.</p>
<p>This would have been a better year for everyone if we learned to take advantage of this new free time we all got &amp; learned that it's good to be alone sometimes. While I'm against these regulations &amp; am 1 of the biggest anti-maskers you'll ever meet, I still worked with what I got &amp; got outside while everyone else was crying on Zoom.</p>

        <p>Of course I did things during the lockdown too. I bought a home gym and used that. Started working too so that took up time. Still, eventually you just want to meet up with people and go to the cinema, or the pub or a festival or on a holiday etc. Most of that has been impossible.</p>

<p>It's also made it near impossible for a normal guy to get a girlfriend. I'm socially awkward as is, this new doomer mess has royally screwed me over.</p>
<p>Imagine some conservative Christian goof having to exclusively use Tinder just to find a date. I've yet to have any luck &amp; the masked selfies dang near give me an aneurysm.</p>

        <p>I've heard even Bumble is still more than 80% male, so no. Do you remember the Ashley Madison scandal, where this dating site for men who wanted to cheat on their wives was "shockingly" discovered to have almost no organic female users?

        <p>I know people who have had it and had a very mild infection, I know people who had it and had a long infection and are recovering (my aunt), I know people who had it and had a nasty cold but made full recoveries, and I know OF people who died...I didn’t know the deaths personally, but they were all older people, not the general population. </p>
<p>On the other hand, nobody in my family, who hasn’t been infected, has had the opportunity to work a proper day since March, and many of my friends and family have suffered emotionally, financially, and mentally. My family is also all over the world: Canada, USA, U.K., Australia, Dubai, Egypt, Kuwait, and having had the connections cut off has made for a significantly more anxiety ridden experience.</p>
<p>2020 was a year of stunted growth for many of us, and I hate every bit of it.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I was so happy in january. I started college, i made new friends and was starting to get more outgoing, seeing my friends more.</p>
<p>Now it’s like we skipped from March to November. The only good thing is that i was promoted in August, but aside from that, i have no good memories of this year. I haven’t seen my friends in a long time and i can’t stand my house anymore.</p>
<p>I can’t wait for the end of this. My favorite nightclub is still closed and i really, REALLY miss that place. It was my favorite place to go, meet new people, dance and get drunk. I haven’t been there since march and that’s all i want right now.</p>

        <p>I didn't. Even as I didn't have much of a life before, but I wanted to spend this year going beyond my current limits. Instead I spent months in self isolation with just my family for actual human interaction. </p>
<p>In a way, it is easy. And I found it easy to adjust first, but the longer this went on, the more insane I found the habits. Those who already gave everything up, just continued to comply. Or those who didn't want it initially have already given up and realized that it was impossible. </p>
<p>But in a way, 2020 provided the wake-up call I needed to tell myself that I can't live like this for the future. I need to go beyond, and life is risky and there is something as the cost of protection being more than the price of living.</p>

        <p>Yeah, losing the opportunity to travel and to go out to live events made me realize I should actually go do that shit more. I've just hunkered down to write stand up comedy material this year. I'm so ready if open mics ever return. Unless the NWO has decided to cancel all stand up for all time.</p>

        <p>I’ve had a lot of illnesses and health problems in my past, way worse than any respiratory flu. I’ve had cancer twice, heart failure, appendicitis, shingles, strep throat a few times, pneumonia, flus, I’m probably forgetting more but you get the point.  I was in the hospital when there was a SARS outbreak and that was during the first time I had cancer. Super weak immune system at that time, but never got it. SARS is a coronavirus like covid, actually they are a lot alike. I was really young but I don’t remember a mass lockdown. There’s clearly more to these lockdowns than a coronavirus flu with a 99% survival rate.</p>

        <p>Been asking this question for a while now. I’ve personally been going out of my way to live my life and have probably gotten out more this year (save for April and May), though it’s been an annoying game of “what won’t get cancelled/closed, what’s going to be so policed it’s not worth it” the whole time. I’m actually amazed at how many people have not left their homes except for essentials since March and are really okay with it. My boyfriend has actually lost three older family members to covid, so I do take it seriously, but I also know each and every one of them was very old or had serious health problems. Those are the people to protect (IF they choose). For the rest of us, giving up a year or more of our lives for a virus that will be like a cold or flu and WE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE EXPOSED TO EVENTUALLY ANYWAY, seems insane. </p>
<p>I try to see all sides of an issue so several times I’ve asked myself if I’m really selfish and trying to kill grandma like they say we are. But is not wanting to live a year or more of your life on house arrest really selfish? Or are they the selfish ones for not considering the people who’ve lost jobs and businesses, committed suicide, or still have to go to work to deliver the goods they order while hiding in their homes? In the end it comes down to quantity vs quality of life, and if lockdowns really save lives long term. I say we let people make those decisions for themselves and don’t get the government involved.</p>

        <p>Many who are vulnerable don't want to be isolated. They don't give a damn because a common cold virus could kill them. They were at risk before this virus. Isolation is killing the vulnerable and at least harming them and causing health declines anyway.</p>

        <p>" Am I being stupid or is it impossible to just isolate those who are vulnerable until there's a vaccine and letting everyone else live like they have pre-2020?"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That's not stupid, at all. That's exactly what would have been done, until quite recently, and it wouldn't have been that hard. Just move the vulnerable people out to more remote locations, away from the high population densities that present them with so much danger.</p>
<p>But, instead, the world went with a half-baked theory dreamed up by a teenaged girl as part of her high school class project, based on untested assumptions that haven't been supported by the data, and this continued because skeptics were either silenced or stigmatized to such an extent that they were ignored.</p>
<p>This has been referred to as "following the science," but really, it's anything but.</p>

I go on hinge dates, have sex with new people who aren’t in my “pod,” go to restaurants, shop for new clothes, offer to work on location when I can. I’m an actor and I even shot a movie this past fall- if you cannot resist in a grand way (in my horrible industry, anybody slightly right of far left is a fAsCIst), you must continue to live your life fully to stick it to the doomers.

<p>Maybe that's why so many just accepted it b/c I'm sure we're not the only ones that weren't too impacted by a lockdown.</p>
<p>We do know one person that got it early on (we ran in to him randomly months later). He had mild symptoms though. Just said it was weird that he couldn't smell or taste anything for a while, but other than that he was fine. Husband does know a couple of ppl at work that have lost loved ones 'supposedly' from covid though and there are a few from his church who have had it and have had loved ones die from it too.</p>

        <p>I had a couple gatherings since march, one was someone's birthday and the other was just some of the family outside around a fire. I've seen a couple people with a cough and runny nose that could literally be anything under the sun. I'm super angry myself and can't really shut up about it because of how long this has went on for. Closing in on a year of our lives gone? I'm gonna complain until my voice gives out. My family is likely not going to do anything for Thanksgiving or Christmas, it's going to be the saddest end of the year we ever had. Every week is almost the same now and trying to find new things to do with myself as I wait longer is starting to become mission impossible. Thank god I'm into music and practically live on Discogs or I would have almost nothing.</p>

<p>i’m not afraid to say that. i’ve lost my fear of death 10 months ago when lockdowns took everything away from me. don’t know why you doomers are so afraid of death when there are no reasons left to live.</p>

        <p>Well, I really don't think this is going to stick around forever. It's literally impossible. We have basically 3 options that may happen: 1. A vaccine for this disease appears and boom back to normal. 2. A vaccine never appears and we die out slowly. 3. Everyone in the world catches it and dies except for people who are immune. I don't know man. Option 1 seems the most viable for me. This vaccine probably won't take more than half a year.</p>

        <p>Do you really think it would be accepted to isolate them all?</p>
<p>But what about the one who end up starving to death in their houses and apartments?</p>
<p>You know damn well giving them "welfare" would go over about as well as wearing masks did.</p>
<p>What about the hospital staff?  Do they have to love at the hospital now? The nursing home?  Because you can't isolate the patients if he staff isn't isolated.</p>

        <p>One year is better than all your future years, or spending the rest of them with permanent damage or lung disability. If you people had listened to science, and listened to the evidence we have had for some time, we’d be back to normal. New Zealand was back to normal after a few months with almost no cases because every wore masks and distanced. The fact this has gone on so long is literally the fault of the same people complaining the hardest about it.</p>

        <p>I live in central Texas. Went to a bar where they required mask, I walked in without one, no one told me shit. Y'all got locked down and I was able to go out and decide whether or not I want to obey the rules which means if they get too heavy handed around here we can choose. You on the other hand cannot. Enjoy that DICK-tator Andrews having complete control of your life. I don't care who got elected I'm not listening to anyone. Fuck the establishment and screw your pussy ass mindset. Sad cause I used to think Australians were tough....I now know I was wrong.</p>

        <p>Really? Anti-science, huh? </p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372?fbclid=IwAR0ULN8J0yuwpkr5Fzn6iJQsVsAFkYFuy_-0I7WX_38I02TRcf1NmlHcRj8">New England Journal of Medicine</a> :</p>
<p>"<em>We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers</em> <strong><em>little, if any, protection from infection</em></strong>. <em>Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes).</em> <strong><em>The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal</em></strong>*. <em>In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</em></p>
<p>This statement near the end of this same article isn't very scientific wouldn't you say?</p>
<p>"<em>It is also clear that masks serve symbolic roles. Masks are not only tools,</em> <strong><em>they are also talismans</em></strong> <em>that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals.</em> <strong><em>Although such reactions may not be strictly logical,</em></strong> <em>we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis."</em></p>
<p>Additional studies confirming the same thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>A randomized controlled trial by the<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029744"> University of Michigan-School of Public Health</a> found hand washing reduced influenza-like illnesses; while mask wearing made no difference whatsoever.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-12-26">German randomized controlled trial</a> found “there was no statistically significant effect” when it came to wearing masks “on secondary infections.”</li>
<li>A 2010 randomized study in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/201/4/491/861190">The Journal of Infectious Diseases </a>found that neither “face mask use and hand hygiene nor face mask use alone was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of influenza-like illnesses cumulatively.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00205.x">randomized controlled trial conducted in Thailand</a> during the H1N1 pandemic found “Influenza transmission was not reduced by interventions to promote hand washing and face mask use.”</li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/003335491012500206">19-month randomized controlled trial</a> of crowded urban households found a significant reduction in upper respiratory infection through educational interventions; but no reduction when adding hand sanitizers or masks.</li>
<li>A randomized controlled trial of people sleeping together in tents during an Islamic pilgrimage was reported in <a href="https://www.eurekaselect.com/125489/article">Infectious Disorders</a>. Researchers found no difference in laboratory confirmed influenza cases among those wearing masks and those who were not. </li>
<li>A <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013998">randomized trial in France</a> found that mask wearing only produced a 0.4% reduction in secondary infection and “did not identify any trend in the results suggesting effectiveness of facemasks.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Then there is this little gem from the CDC itself:</p>
<p><strong>CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel</strong> page 39 they have not isolated the virus :</p>
<p>"<em>The analytical sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assays contained in the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019- nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel were determined in Limit of Detection studies.</em> <strong><em>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available</em></strong>*, <em>assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/μL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen. Samples were extracted using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument and EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (Cat# 62724) and manually with the QIAGEN DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat# 61904). Real-Time RT-PCR assays were performed using the ThemoFisher Scientific TaqPathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Cat# A15299) on the Applied BiosystemsTM 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time PCR Instrument according to the CDC 2019-nCoV Real- Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel instructions for use</em>*.
