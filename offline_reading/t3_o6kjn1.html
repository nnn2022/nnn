        <p>Is coercion an exact translation? They usually don’t say coercion because it is internationally illegal to coerce a medical experiment due to the Nuremberg Code. If this guy is seriously talking about coercion then he should stand trial with the other nazis</p>

        <p>As established by OKO.press, at the away meeting of the PiS club, Jarosław Kaczyński, president, made it clear that the government was considering compulsory vaccinations: <strong>"If persuasion, incentives and awards are not convincing, this is what the state is for as an organization of compulsion" - PiS president said</strong></p>
<p>On June 15, right after the parliamentary vote on the appointment of the Ombudsman's office, members of the United Right went to Przysucha for an away parliamentary club meeting. They gathered in the gymnasium and waited for the most important PiS politicians to take the floor . <strong>Behind the presidential table were President Jarosław Kaczyński, Speaker of the Sejm Elżbieta Witek, Deputy Speaker Ryszard Terlecki, as well as two leaders of coalition groups: Zbigniew Ziobro and Jarosław Gowin.</strong></p>
<p>OKO.press established a few threads from Deputy Prime Minister Kaczyński's speech to the deputies. <strong>He started with a pandemic and announced that the authorities expected the fourth wave of cases in the fall.</strong> This did not surprise anyone. Contrary to what he said about the vaccination campaign.</p>
<p><strong>“The president of the PiS club said that party members need to mobilize people to vaccinate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And that if translation, incentives and even rewards do not help, then coercive measures will have to be considered. That the state is a coercive organization and sometimes it has to use it "</strong></p>
<p><strong>- tells us one of the members of the PiS club. We also confirmed the information about the possible compulsion of Poles to vaccinate with the politician of the Covenant, who tells us that there was talk of a possible "persuasion".</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>The idea of ​​compulsion was already publicly signaled on April 30 by the prime minister's chief adviser on COVID-19, Professor Andrzej Horban:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“You may need to introduce something like this. But it is difficult to imagine, in turn, that the Minister of Health or the Deputy Minister will run after the citizen with a syringe under police protection and try to forcibly vaccinate "- he said in the TVN24 program.</strong></p>
<p>They will argue about "sanitary segregation"The subject of vaccines and the pandemic among the members of the United Right has aroused increasing concern and political emotions. Because there are many skeptics in PiS who unofficially do not hide their fears that vaccines may cause side effects in the future. <strong>Even the so-called soft coercion, to promote those who have been vaccinated, e.g. not included in quotas (e.g. in hotels) and restrictions.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This situation is an opportunity for those who are working to weaken the position of Prime Minister Morawiecki. The politicians of Solidarity of Poland Zbigniew Ziobro, supported by the media of Father Tadeusz Rydzyk, are still chasing the head of the government.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In "Nasz Dziennik", <strong>the Redemptorist hardly writes about vaccines, and if anything, then critically. The newspaper focuses on the discussion about the salutary drug, how they present in the pages amantadine not approved for COVID-19 treatment, recovery programs after contracting COVID, and finally on the defense of doctors who question the methods of fighting the pandemic. Since the PiS MP Anna Maria Siarkowka started talking about the "sanitary segregation" of vaccines, she became a regular guest in the Rydzyk media. A similar vein is also expressed, among others, by Janusz Kowalski from Solidarity Poland.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>"If Ziobro's people lose their illusions that they can get on the PiS lists in the elections, they can more and more often oppose the possible vaccination obligation. The more so that the ground for such a message is made by the Confederation, which competes with Solidarna Polska about who is the more extreme right "</strong></p>
<p>- tells us one of the most radical PiS deputies.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>The topic of dividing Poles into vaccinated and unvaccinated was presented as a key topic by Grzegorz Braun, candidate on behalf of the Confederation in the elections for the presidency of Rzeszów (he received almost 10 percent of the votes).</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>The Kult band gave another pretext to speak against promoting vaccinated people  , another Confederation politician, Krzysztof Bosak , who declared that everyone would be admitted to his concerts, regardless of whether they were vaccinated or not.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>"They are right. Paranoia about this security is growing. This segregation has no legal or medical basis. Politicians, with the joyful participation of the media, made a public spectacle of the vaccination campaign, and soon everyone will have to stick a vaccination certificate on their forehead, ” said Bosak in Polsat News, and the Confederation posted his statement on its Facebook profile.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Despite the apparent euphoria, information campaign, in which Morawiecki himself finally got involved, and TVP propaganda with a great pump welcoming further shipments of vaccines purchased for Poles, vaccinations still raise a lot of fear and resistance. This is closely monitored by the Prime Minister's Office, and all government communication efforts are focused on vaccination promotion. The government realizes that if Poles do not get vaccinated in sufficient numbers, the fourth wave may come in the fall, and thus possible lockdown and restrictions. And this would massively shake the position of Morawiecki as the head of the government.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>“Morawiecki, during the increase in the number of cases and deaths during the third wave, came under fire. His dismissal was seriously considered. It was only thanks to vaccines and the hope that they would return to normalcy that he saved his position. However, if he does not stop the fourth wave, his fate may be sealed, ”comments our source from the prime minister's entourage.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The 4th wave as a political riskWhat did Jarosław Kaczyński mean when he spoke about forcing vaccinations? Probably not compulsory vaccination in the strict sense - <strong>no country in the European Union decided to do so and it is hard to imagine that the government would want to enforce such an obligation, for example, under the threat of a mandate or a fine. Probably the social resistance would be significant. But one can imagine the pressure on unvaccinated citizens, for example in the form of restrictions on the use of gastronomy, entertainment and culture.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The fourth wave of a pandemic would be a big problem for the government camp. Especially that compared to Europe, the percentage of vaccinated elderly people in Poland is still low - in Poland it is only 60.9%. seniors over 80 years of age, and here from "our yard", apart from Czechs and Hungarians, we are overtaken by Slovenians and Estonians, as well as Greeks. This percentage has been increasing very slowly for many weeks.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>This puts people at risk at risk if the pandemic returns, such as the Delta variant that is raging in the UK right now. And the combination of unvaccinated seniors and the new variant could once again shake the healthcare system. Experts reassure that a surge in infections and a system collapse is not very likely, but that the government cannot afford such a risky political gamble.</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the vaccination process, it was going smoothly: the government propaganda at every step emphasized that we vaccinate the fastest in large European Union countries, despite the limited availability of vaccines at that time. Now there are plenty of vaccines (29.6 million doses imported, 27 million of which were delivered to vaccination centers), but you can already see that we will be lagging behind these large countries.<br>
When it comes to the percentage of adults who have taken at least one dose, we are now in 17th place in the EU with 52.3%. vaccinated.<br>
It is noticeable that the entire bottom of the table is occupied by the former "people's democratic countries": only Hungary (66.2%) and the Czech Republic (53.3%) vaccinate more and faster than us.<br>
Hungary is a separate case, because almost from the beginning it had access to a larger pool of vaccines - it decided on the Russian Sputnik V and the Chinese Sinopharm. Only Greece and Sweden are more vulnerable than we are from outside the Eastern Bloc and former Yugoslavia.<br>
More detailed data show that the number of people vaccinated in the following weeks with the first dose is falling, which may mean that we are dealing with a "saturation" of interest: those who cared most have already been vaccinated.</p>
