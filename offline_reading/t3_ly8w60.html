    <strong>I am seeing a lot of people here starting to connect the dots...</strong>
    <p><p>... I encourage you to make the final leap. This has never been about safety or health or your well being, as much as the Powers That Be would have you believe it. This was a golden opportunity for the wealthiest, most powerful people in the world to attempt to finally tip the scales in their favor and gain total control over the populace. I know I don’t need to convince a lot of you of this; you’ve just felt it. People are seeing the “vaccine passports” and wondering just why in the world would anyone think that’s ok. Good. It’s not ok. It’s just another step toward the ultimate goal of having everything you do, every movement, every idea, every transaction under surveillance. Knowledge is power. The elite globalists want to know everything they can about you so they can gain more and more control over you.</p>
<p>Imagine if your government could track and control your health compliance and use that information to determine if you should be allowed to have a certain job. Imagine if your level of compliance were tied to the income you were allowed to have and how/when you received your paycheck. Imagine if your government could decide that you were not deserving of everything you’ve earned and could just take it from you and hand it to someone more “deserving” with a simple online transaction. Imagine if your government could decide they didn’t like the opinions you were voicing and could suspend your ability to buy anything, like groceries for your family, until you stepped in line...</p>
