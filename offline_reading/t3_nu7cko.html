    <strong>Kinda ranting</strong>
    <p><p>Does anyone else have a clear cut understanding and seen enough of this nonsense to determine weather the pandemic was a scripted play or real. But cant formulate it to people in an understanding way?</p>
<p>Is it just me or, people im conversing with are triplehard headed? I dont get it... shit is is plain and fucking simple..</p>
<p>People need to realize we all came into this world with our own desires and free will.  Is it hard to believe that government bodies big corporations pharmaceutical companies or political movements  dont have your best interest? And that regular are the only ones with desires and capability to do bad</p>
<p>Infact its obvious that the more money/wealth  power/authority  the more opportunity to do bad and also a greater  impact your actions will have. </p>
<p>Why do we (as civilians) consider officials to be saints? Why do we put our trust in cops when they have their own bro code and will do anything to save their own self.  All these little cults have no care in the world for you. </p>
<p>The left the right the Chinese the Russian all elites are working on the same team.  </p>
<p>Those border lines dont mean shit. its just their to deceive the masses into divide and conquer. The elite put out propaganda and fake news so your emotions can feel how they want you to feel. They have patented this for a while now. Its called Nervous system manipulation by electromagnetic feils from monitors. </p>
<p>The same technology they use in a scary movie for example.. let's say your watching paranormal activity,  you're about to reach a scary scene and the build up is happening.  The emotional effect you receive is actually a built in artificial pulse sent to your body to produce the emotion.  Please check out the paten link as it has diagrams to show you </p>
<p><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6506148B2/en">nervous system manipulation </a></p>
<p>You think you fighting for your country when you go overseas?   Think about it your only killing.  Nothing more nothing less.  The people follow orders from their sergeant or captain and respect the game ( the hierarchy system) you obey when commanded
And you suck up whatever information was giving to you.  No disrespect to the soldier.</p>
<p>Lets talk about currency </p>
<p>Why do you have to work for money to buy shit that they created to add ontop of our struggles.</p>
<p>They create all these expenses that was non existent  4 decades ago.. ontop of that you have media and advertising's that suck your kids into wanting this and that. Why do a handful of companies monopolize off everything. </p>
<p>Why do we have to pay for internet, cellphone bils and electricity ? If you were practically forced into using it as part of your lifestyle?<br>
How can we have so much land un occupied but yet we have so much regulation on where to build and who can build and getting permits?? Yet homeless are struggling </p>
<p>Who said we need to pay taxes? Who said we need to buy license plate for our car? Who said you need to buy a sticker for your license plate?  Who told you you have to renew it each year? Why cant we opt out of insurance?  Why do we need a lawyer to represent us? Why is court and the justice system based off of word play? So much so that your own lawyer tells you not to speak at all? Why do we pay fines for traffic violations? </p>
<p>Money is just a tool to keep us asleep lookin down and busy with this fast world. Especially for the white collar workers. </p>
<p>These idiotic things all happen because we dont pay attention to who we allowed to be ruling us</p>
<p>This world is a game to the elite. They created money to establish the ultimate pyramid system.  A system where you as a peasant would never even see the face of the one who is really calling the shots on how you live. let alone know who it is</p>
<p>Dont comment about my grammer because im going to sleep</p></p>
