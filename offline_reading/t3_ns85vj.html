    <strong>MORE FAUCI EMAILS -- the Informed Consent Action Network obtains ~3,000 more pages of Dr. Fauci's emails. Here is some of what they say.</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.icandecide.org/ican_press/ican-obtains-over-3000-pages-of-tony-faucis-emails/">https://www.icandecide.org/ican_press/ican-obtains-over-3000-pages-of-tony-faucis-emails/</a></p>
<p>Read Fauci’s emails <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/e7wi0lqjd1d5lcx/Combined_Fauci_Emails_in_Chron_Order_OCRd_FINAL.pdf/file">here</a> and a few highlights from these emails are outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>February 5-6, 2020 (000239) – Fauci asked to recommend names for WHO group with the broad mission to “look at the origins and evolution of 2019n-CoV.”  Fauci responds by seeking to reframe the mission in a manner that would only look for natural and not lab made origin.</li>
<li>February 7, 2020 (000189) - Fauci sent an internal NIAID communication reflecting that it was unlikely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in a wet market.</li>
<li>February 16, 2020 (000447) – Fauci tells CBS reporter that if the mortality turns out to be 0.2% to 0.4%, then SARS-CoV-2 should be treated like a severe seasonal flu.  But when the case fatality rate was later revised to between 0.2% and 0.4% by the CDC, Fauci continued to act as if the virus was something far more dangerous.</li>
<li>February 17, 2020 (000422) – Fauci receives communication from a Chinese citizen that is part of an international student program in the United States stating that, based on his contacts back in Wuhan, including correspondence from a nurse working in a Wuhan hospital, there is far more spread of the virus and far more deaths than China is admitting.</li>
<li>February 21, 2020 (000300) – Fauci asks a Deputy Director at NIAID to “Please handle” an email received by a group of doctors and scientists, including a virologist, that opined that “we think there is a possibility that the virus was released from a lab in wuhan (sic).”</li>
<li>February 23, 2020 (000257) – Fauci states “Transmission is definitely by respiratory droplet” and that “Children have very low rate of infection.”</li>
<li>February 22, 2020 (000274-277) – Fauci confirms that “The vast majority of people outside of China do not need to wear a mask.  A mask is more appropriate for someone who is infected than for people trying to protect against infection.”</li>
<li>February 27, 2020 (000649) – Fauci tells Morgan Fairchild to tell her followers to be ready for “social distancing, teleworking, temporary closure of schools, etc.”</li>
<li>February 28, 2020 (001054) – Fauci, while uncertain what animal may have served as the intermediary jump from bats to humans for SARS-CoV-2, keeps repeating the narrative that it was a jump from bats through some natural non-lab means that was the origin of the virus.</li>
<li>February 28, 2020 (001059) – Fauci giving personal update to Mark Zuckerberg regarding developing a COVID-19 vaccine including telling Zuckerberg that “We may need help with resources” and that if there is a delay in the development timeline he just told Zuckerberg about, “I will contact you.”</li>
<li>March 1, 2020 (000922) – CBS’s Chief Medical Correspondent, seeking to please Fauci, emails Fauci a link to his segment which he appears to repeat what Fauci has told him, including that face masks “may give some partial protection by catching droplets containing virus but the virus is so tiny the virus can go right through it or around it” and describing the origin of the virus as “jumping from animals to people.”  Fauci responds with “Outstanding!!” apparently pleased that CBS pushed Fauci’s narrative that the virus was a natural jump from bats to humans.</li>
<li>March 1, 2020 (000937) – Despite media reports, Fauci makes it crystal clear he was not being muzzled by the White House.</li>
<li>March 16, 2020 (001554) – Fauci is asked “Given the relative safety of all but the elderly and those whose immune systems are compromised, and that they are far fewer than the rest of the population, why not quarantine only them?” and responds by stating “Stay tuned.”</li>
<li>March 17, 2020 (001537) – The next day, it does not appear Fauci intends to change his tune of pushing everyone, even healthy people with low risk of the virus, to give up all civil liberties and remain prisoners in their home, as reflecting in an email exchange between Fauci and Mark Zuckerberg, in which they share mobile numbers and plan to coordinate efforts to get people to comply with Fauci’s messaging, including social distancing for everyone, but the details of their plan are not included in the email exchange.</li>
<li>March 31, 2020 (001816) – Fauci receives a summary from his agency of the studies regarding how effective masks are to preventing the virus and the conclusion is as follows: “Bottom line: generally there were not differences in ILI/URI/or flu rates when masks were used.”</li>
<li>April 2, 2020 (001778) – Fauci and Bill Gates have phone call where they agreed to a “collaborative” and “synergistic approach to COVID-19 on the part of NIAID/NIH, BARDS and the BMGF (Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation).”  It is concerning that one private person, Bill Gates, and his organization, BMGF, can exert that much behind-the-scenes influence on decisions that will impact the civil rights of all Americans during the pandemic.</li>
<li>April 8, 2020 (002351-2352) – Fauci, rejects most requests for calls, but accepts without any questions a request to arrange a call with the CEO of a Lilly, a major pharmaceutical company.</li>
<li>April 11, 2020 (002263-2264) – While Fauci claimed to have little time for anything else, Fauci confirmed the continued filming of “a film that will celebrate the importance of your [Fauci’s] life, science and public health” including filming during his “drive to NIH … once or twice a week,” “capture your working/appropriate conversations,” and “work on the Task Force.”</li>
<li>April 12, 2020 (002229) – Fauci writes “Many tests that have been used thus far are not accurate and ARE MISLEADING.”</li>
<li>April 16, 2020 (002142) – Fauci advises that even in the health care setting the mask policy should remain “voluntary.”</li>
<li>April 20, 2020 (002548-2549) – A Washington Post reporter contacts Katie Miller at NIAID for copies of article that Fauci stated are proof that the virus originated by natural means rather than being developed in a lab.  Instead of letting Katie Miller or someone on his staff respond, Fauci, who stated he gets 1,000 or 2,000 emails per day and only has time to respond to a tiny number of these emails, personally responds to the Washington Post reporter (who did not even write to Fauci) with the copies of the studies.</li>
<li>April 22, 2020 (002471-2472) – The National Academy of Science representative confirming to Dr. Francis Collins, head of NIH, that “WHO, Gates Foundation and European Commission have been leading and planning” the “global coordinating effort to accelerate vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics” and that “there will be an announcement on the global structure with will [sic] involve Gates, WHO etc.” and Fauci explains in an email that “we have Gates reps on our ACTIV (Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines) working groups.”  Why is an unelected individual with his own private interests getting this incredible level of influence over decisions that will affect the freedoms and liberties of everyday Americans?</li>
<li>April 27, 2020 (002910) – Fauci appears to dismiss potential live saving treatment.  Fauci receives a report from the Chief, Section of Viral Pathogenesis at NIAID, Dr. Paolo Lussa, that “they treated a first group of five patients with potent anti-aggregant therapy (Tirofiban/Aggrastat) and apparently in all of them the p02 started to rise within less than 2 hours, they got off the ventilator and went on to full recovery.”  In response to this incredible news, Fauci merely writes “Thanks, Paolo.”  Apart from pushing Remdesivir, made by Gilead, a company with which Fauci has deep and long-standing connections, Fauci’s response to Dr. Lussa accords with his otherwise singular focus on developing and pushing a vaccine.</li>
<li>May 1, 2020 (002838) – While pushing one narrative regarding ventilators publicly, Fauci writes in a private email that “You are correct in that there is a more recent tendency to use ventilators only as a very last resort since oxygenation rather than ventilation appears to be key to recovery."</li>

        <p>No they very much are not!  They are one of the original antivaxers pushing the total rubbish that GAVE antivaxers their bad name and reputation.  Their years of pointless and completely wrong attacks on vaccines are one of the big reasons why any critisim of the covid vaccines gets pushed aside.  These guys are trash.  They worked w/ the disgraced Andrew Wakefield that made up the MMR-autism link to try and sell another companies vaccine.</p>

        <p>Did you read this post?  It appears as though Dr. Fauci has colluded with officials from several different organizations including government, Big Tech and our public health institutions. </p>
<p>They have been covering up the lab leak.  They have been promoting culturally division strategies like masks and social distancing, even though they knew they didn't work.  And in very Orwellian fashion, they colluded with Big Tech to erase and remove any mention of these to the public thus igniting a divisive cultural struggle which has driven a wedge through society.</p>

        <p>I find it fascinating that you haven't seen the last year and half as an utterly destructive force on the lives, families and businesses of this country.  This man had a <em>responsibility</em> to not play politics,  and to <em>help</em> people to the best of his ability..  and he did none of that.</p>
<p>The homelessness,  the absolute predation and abandonment of that population.  Children pulled out of schools,  thrown in front of a computer with zero planning and a complete lack of social outreach to aid and assist anyone dealing with that challenge.  All of us pushed into a baffling drug trial while treatments are just <em>sitting</em> there on the shelf that he knew about.  None of this addressed,  but he's got a time to write a book deal about how to fail this badly in a crisis?</p>
<p>You can look past all of that and shrug?</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>

        <p>Fauci has been lying about the need for qurantines for the vast majority of people, the efficacy of masks, the spread and mortality rates of Covid. And yet you question how we can "jump to those conclusions". What are you gaining by this? Or are you so indoctrinated that your mind is gone?</p>
