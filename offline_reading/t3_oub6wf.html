    <strong>Bush's "Axis of Evil" Iraq War speechwriter wrote inflammatory article about the unvaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>Read this today in a financial blog: </p>
<p>‚ÄúVaccinated America Has Had Enough,‚Äù writes editor David Frum in <em>The Atlantic</em> magazine, picking up the ‚Äúanger‚Äù theme we explored <a href="https://www.rogueeconomics.com/bill-bonner-diary/the-brave-new-world-a-mission-economy/">yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>To fully understand where this is coming from, you have to connect the dots.</p>
<p>Frum was a speechwriter for George W. Bush. It was he who came up with the preposterous ‚ÄúAxis of Evil‚Äù epithet.</p>
<p>Back then, his mission was to gin up support for the U.S. invasion of  Iraq. You were either ‚Äúwith us or against us‚Äù said George W., perhaps  reading Frum‚Äôs words on a teleprompter.</p>

<p>Some of you may not be old enough to remember, but I remember pretty clearly the GW Bush (aka "Dubya") era and his Anakin Skywalker-style rhetoric. It looks the unvaccinated are the new Saddam and our bodies the "weapons of mass destruction." It's funny how the same Dubya playbook is being used against those who claimed they hated him back then.</p>
<p>(Bill Bonner is my favorite financial writer. He correctly predicted the bursting of the previous housing bubble and skyrocketing price of gold when it was at $200/oz.)</p></p>

        <p>I'm a Desert Storm veteran and I was shocked by the ridiculous "weapons of mass destruction" allegations by the Bush/Cheney charade against Saddam Hussein and Iraq. We gave Iraq chemical warfare to use on Iran after the embassy hostage crisis, he also used agents on Kurdish people and the remainder were destroyed by EOD during the Ceasefire Occupation. The American people are constantly being lied to, even though the history and evidence is easily researched, and doesn't even qualify as a conspiracy theory. This is simply the business of the US government.</p>

        <p>The lack of historical self awareness in this rhetoric is almost comical if we‚Äôre not shamefully abhorrent - I never expected this sort of talk in a Western nation, having I heard the radio transmissions build up in Rwanda.</p>

<p>I would love to hear more about that--did you live in Rwanda at the time? Anything you can share?</p>

        <p>My mother ran an infrastructure NGO for profit (an early proto trade aid at behest UN); basically business skills and agricultural trade exchange to boost local output. Eg. Fisherman &rt; Fishing Fleet affair. Fresh as a daisy out of Uni, I helped set up a satcom network to London. Doing my thing, I looked like a spy üòÅ</p>
<p>She and her team knew Kagame and his people well enough that we received heads up on the unrest. For months a lot of low key snarling in papers and radio. The UN knew something was brewing and gave advisories but on the whole and as usual, seemed reluctant to become a living fence.</p>
<p>Talk shows were often taken over by a pundit discussing the dirty Tutsi and how they were responsible for various ills. Talking points that rattle off like unvaxxed commentary is you switched words.</p>
<p>The rhetoric of late is actually bothering me significantly, and supposedly educated westerners are quickly adopting the same snarled remarks and view of ‚Äòthe others‚Äô.</p>
<p>To be fair, this isn‚Äôt the place to run through the whole mess, but we bugged out about five maybe six days before it went to bloody hell.</p>
<p>Next project was in Sierra Leone. Between the second and third coup. I can assure there was no rebel uprising against Freetown, it was Liberian militias moving into SL for diamonds and agricultural lands. Saw results first hand. May as well have joined the army given what I saw in 90‚Äôs Africa states.</p>
<p>Hmmm.. yeah let‚Äôs hope it doesn‚Äôt go there in the west. Probably end up way more sophisticated tbh. Shrug. People are utterly brutal. Haven‚Äôt thought about that stuff for awhile.</p>

        <p>That's an incredible account.</p>
<p>What has been most terrifying for me over the last year and a half, is watching people I thought were intelligent, empathetic, and logical, turn into rabid zealots spouting the most hateful vituperation I've ever heard in my life.</p>

        <p>Thank you, I‚Äôve glossed over a fair bit admittedly - much wrapped together - I was harsh on the UN, they lost people; it‚Äôs more the higher ups losing their nerve. Mitigating. </p>
<p>I wonder every day where the real leaders are, who recognise the madness and are willing to step up and say no. We‚Äôre seeing some, just unsure if legitimate or for political posturing.</p>
<p>Doesn‚Äôt surprise me that African statesmen have been quick to call BS. And suffered for it. Free aid has crippled many nations economy; so to some vax initiatives. They have every right to be skeptical.</p>

<p>Well, that's because they have/had the same boss. The former and his clan called him Poppy. I call him that fucking murderous bastard.</p>
