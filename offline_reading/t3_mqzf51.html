    <strong>On Covid Tests</strong>
    <p><p>I'm surprised no one here has talked about this.</p>
<p>I've had to do a test because school mandated it and it was absolutely one of the most uncomfortable painful experience I've ever had. It's simply an invasive and very painful thing to do, it feels likethe doctors who do this shit are sadists.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now a lot of professions require testing every other week or so, and school kids have mandatory testing. This is about control, it's about them telling you "<strong>we own you, we own your body and there is nothing you can do about it.</strong> We wil make you hurt".</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Did anyone here have covid tests? Do you agree with me?</p></p>

        <p>Thank God I have not been mandated by my school yet but I am expecting it to become a thing once they let us attend our classes in person again . Might as well not get my degree ðŸ’€</p>

        <p>I was made to get one when I took my kid to get one so he could continue going to school. I'm a fairly tough person, but it was a lot more painful than I expected. It felt like acid being put up my nose. I couldn't breathe right out of that nare for about a week. It was stuffy for several days, but felt weird for much longer. It's definitely invasive and not something that should be done multiple times in order for people to work or go to school. It used to be only done by choice for people who go to the Dr for flu medication, which I have never once done. I stay home when sick, sleep as much as possible and drink lots of fluids.</p>

        <p>It's not that bad, tbh. I hate that it's used to drive up numbers unnecessarily but I've had way worse in my life. It's just annoying and unnecessary.</p>

        <p>I do agree. Thank God I haven't been told I need a test. But you're right, it's about control. If someone tried to force me to get tested I would deny them, 100%. And if someone said my children needed to get tested I'd go ape shit.</p>

        <p>I had one and it wasnâ€™t bad. My husband had two and he said thereâ€™s two different types of tests, one was like the one I got and the other was really bad. Not sure why they shove the swab up so high only sometimes.</p>
