        <p>Just for that, 0.</p>
<p>However, I unfriended a lot because they turned aggressive and started insulting me or wishing me and my family "covid death" for speaking about my views.</p>

        <p>Two. </p>
<p>The first works for the NHS and knows the death count is being inflated. She said that it's important to do this as nobody would take it seriously otherwise. I suggested that measures be taken to protect the people at risk, while letting everybody else live their lives. She disagreed with this as she felt that it would be discrimination. I could handle having a friend who disagreed with me on those issues. </p>
<p>The tipping point was when two of our friends committed suicide after receiving a positive PCR test. They had no symptoms, so they could easily have been false positives given how inaccurate they are. They were also both healthy and in their 20s, so their chance of surviving was extremely high even if they were infected.</p>
<p>After they committed suicide, she said that they were necessary sacrifices and the fearmongering must continue for the greater good. It's impossible to be friends with somebody who is that messed up. </p>
<p>The second is a BBC nut who calls anything a conspiracy theory if he hasn't personally seen the BBC announce it. </p>
<p>He called me a conspiracy theorist when I said that the AstraZeneca jab uses a chimpanzee adenovirus (he is convinced that it uses a killed SARS-CoV2 virus), then a conspiracy theorist again when I said that there were plans to vaccinate 12 year olds in September.  When the BBC announced it, he went from saying that it was 'sick to experiment on children' to 'so happy that his 12 year old son can get the vaccine'. </p>
<p>His mother also died of a heart attack because the closest hospital wouldn't accept her due to allegedly being full with COVID-19 patients. He claims that he knows it was empty, but said that her death was necessary as there might have been a surge of COVID-19 patients that night that needed the beds.</p>
<p>The guy is too far gone to be worth communicating with anymore.</p>

        <p>Wow, the fact that multiple people are saying "necessary deaths" is just astounding to me. I'm so sorry about your friends who tested positive. That's horrible.</p>

        <p>They may have both used the word 'necessary' as I used the word 'unnecessary' to describe the deaths caused by the government's reaction to COVID-19.</p>

        <p>I won't call any of my siblings anymore. I won't call my grandma or aunt either. We're all respectful with one another but the tension is palpable. The conversation is avoided, the topics are shallow, flow of conversation is stiff. The phone call just isn't worth it anymore.</p>
