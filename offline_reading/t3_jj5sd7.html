    <strong>Tip for Meetings: Do you need me to wear a mask?</strong>
    <p><p>I run a side business and when this mask thing became PC, I wore one in to my appointment. My client immediately asked "Oh, do you need me to wear one?" (friendly, non condescending) - I said: do you need ME to where one *lol*? We both had a good laugh. Had she not said that we would have both been wearing one for no reason!</p>
<p>When you have to meet someone, be it a business or social setting, show up without a mask and if they are wearing a mask say: "Oh, do I need to wear a mask?" - don't immediately assume they are a doomer as they be actually be anti covid and just scared of being shamed.</p>
<p>What this does is signal that you are not afraid and that this is a safe space. Your guest / colleague etc may be wearing the mask to be socially acceptable as to not tarnish his/her reputation. They now know they can relax (as long as no one is waiting to photograph them!)</p></p>

        <p>I interact with a lot of people from all levels of various companies.  I've noticed something similar.  If I'm dealing with higher corporate types, they're just putting the mask on for show most of the time.  They take it off when nobody else who would say anything is around.  Same for manual labor positions.  It seems to be the everyday pencil pusher cubicle people who are scared for their lives.  I'd love to know the psychology behind it.</p>

        <p>One theory is the pencil pusher types have such a boring life deprived of outdoors / exercise (as opposed to trades people in your example) and also lack any financial success and power. </p>
<p>Perhaps the mask is the first thing that has happened in their life since childhood that makes them feel like they are making a positive impact / part of something important? Could the fear they feel be the only "excitement" they have had in a very long time?</p>
<p>Successful individuals derive this pleasure from making big achievements and business deals. People who work outdoors are very healthy from the fresh air and exercise which keeps the dopamine in their brain at a reasonable level.</p>

        <p>I have noticed the biggest mask-pushers were the most miserable and annoying people to be around prior to the corona.</p>

        <p>I've noticed the same. Most serious doomers at this point have unresolved anxiety, psychological issues, insecurities, and a lack of critical thinking.</p>

        <p>Probably because people who work manual labor and executives both are experienced with risk management. Pencil pushers just do what they’re told and don’t have to make many decisions on their own.</p>

        <p>I've been doing this regularly. Whenever I meet with a service person, or have someone come to my workshop, I directly and genuinely ask them "would you be more comfortable if I wore a mask?" So far, nobody has answered in the affirmative.</p>

        <p>My mother is adamant on doing the house out (lucky she can see through this plandemic). We’ve had countless of labourers inside the house this year. Let’s say out of 6 companies, only one turned up with a mask. The last folks seemed tuned in; knowing about the cashless society and all (plus no unsocial distancing). I don’t really interact with people outside my family so it’s great knowing a bit of normality is still here :)</p>

        <p>I ask that often as well, since I go into people's homes as part of my job.   I've noticed if they answer the door without a mask I don't need to ask the question.   If they have a mask on, it's about fifty fifty when I ask that question.  There's still a lot of scared folks.</p>
