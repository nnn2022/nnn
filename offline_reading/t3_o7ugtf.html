    <strong>How can people on this sub be so contradictory?</strong>
    <p><p>They're genuinely the stupidest community I've seen on the internet. How do they contradict everything they say? For example, there have been 3.9 million deaths since the beginning of the virus but the vaccine has one supposed death and they think the vaccine is worse than the virus. They call people pro science (masks, lockdowns) doomers yet they believe that government started lockdowns to gain control and compare themselves to Jews in Holocaust Germany. They simultaneously think Covid is a man made virus from China to kill people and then they go and call it a harmless cold. How are they so fucking stupid? </p>
<p>It's really fascinating how much their own theories contradict.</p>
<p>People with a lack of control over their lives have a higher tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. Source: <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/05/why-more-highly-educated-people-are-less-into-conspiracy-theories/">https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/04/05/why-more-highly-educated-people-are-less-into-conspiracy-theories/</a></p>
<p>So, it's paranoia that their driving force, and paranoia is not based in logic. They've concocted a fantasy world where they are the "only ones who know the truth." And like another user said, because it's their new reality, they will go through every logical loophole to uphold it (cognitive dissonance). As more of the logical fallacies are exposed, the more detached from reality they become. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.2466/17.CP.4.19">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.2466/17.CP.4.19</a></p>
<p>I think we need to treat these people like brainwashed doomsday culters, because really, that's what they are. Completely detached from reality.</p></p>

        <p>Hi! Thanks for passing by.</p>
<p>The CDC has confirmed that spread is airborne on May 7th. Could you provide any piece of research that says that surgical masks provide protection against an airborne threat?</p>
<p>Florida has been wide open since around September 2020, it hasn't fared worse than places like California. Not to mention Sweden. How does science justify that?</p>
<p>Of those 3.9 million deaths, how many were in healthy people under say, 60 years of age? What's the science behind locking them up instead of going for a <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/">focused protection</a> approach?</p>
<p>What's the science behind locking down a state in which a virus is already widespread, to supposedly limit the spread of the virus itself? It goes against all WHO guidelines from before 2020, where it says explicitly that normal life should be allowed to continue as normally as possible. Why the change?</p>
<p>Hoping to hear from you soon, I wish you a great day.</p>

        <p>Covid is a cold with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. Smart people aren't afraid of it. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. Most of the links below are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. Most of rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists/ scientists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>
<p>Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the Fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>

<p>Masks dont work, especially the fabric ones:</p>
<p>These are just some articles about masks:  not .gov links so take them with a grain of salt:</p>

<p>Now for the more medical journal type stuff on masks (most of these are referenced in the white paper in the next section, some say they work ans some say they don't...what they all show is the mandates are worthless)</p>

<p>All these studies are referenced in the white paper below.</p>

<p>In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>
<p>Comorbidities data: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities</a></p>

<p>Btw that translates to survival rates by age (if you get infected):</p>
<p>0-17                   99.998%</p>
<p>18-49                99.95%</p>
<p>50-64                99.4%</p>
<p>65+                     91%</p>

<p>As for government...yes they went full authoritarian over the common cold. They shut down businesseses, the economy...went full on command economy. They used covid to control you.</p>

        <p>So despite what you may experience as a liberal, we (as non-borg human beings) don't all partake in groupthink; therefore, points of view from one <em>individual</em> to another tend to vary. We don't all simply parrot the talking points we hear on TV. Crazy thing about it is this: it's that very discourse which brings us closer to the truth! You might think that "science" means simply believing people who tell you what science is acceptable, but that's the furthest thing from real science. If no alternative views are allowed, no progress can be made. </p>
<p>That all having been said, I must be a glutton for punishment trying to explain this to someone with your outlook.</p>

        <p>Is the one supposed death Hank Aaron, DMX or Larry King? Or is it the 2 BBC reporters? Or the Pilots? Or the 13 year old boy? Vikram, the Indian star? Or the babies who died drinking breast milk from a vaccinated mother? Or was it that young doctor who mocked people for vaccine hesitancy.</p>
<p>They all died shortly after taking the vaccine as well as 10s of thousands of others. So, could you clarify the one supposed death you are eluding to?</p>
<p>See, I think the problem is you are full of shit. You are willing to believe every one of those 3.9 m people were covid victims and none of the deaths following vaccination were vaccination victims. You see? You are a fuckwit.</p>

        <p>Simply put, there are different people with different options and perspectives. This isn't just some hive mind, group think, mantra chanting the same thing over and over like some other places.  </p>
<p>I don't agree with everything said here. But some of it I do. So, here I am, enjoying most of the conversation being had. </p>
<p>Like I said before, we are all just people trying to make sense of it all. </p>
<p>Censorship has never worked in the good of the people. And unfortunately, a lot of good hearted people asking reasonable and sound questions get censored, mocked, made fun of for asking legitimate questions. Instead of having a respectable conversation of differing opinions.</p>

        <p>Lol why is it that the left believes that we all think the exact same? Is it because they all do? I am a genuine individual with certain beliefs. For example, I don’t believe in most social programs that are paid for with tax payer dollars. However, I don’t really care if you get an abortion or wanted to be sodomized. I am more aligned with conservative think, but I don’t support 100% of the ideology. So when it comes to something like this, I am skeptical of the players and the blatant hypocrisy that governments have shown in the last year and a half. That doesn’t mean I believe in every ridiculous conspiracy that has popped up, but I have used my own reasoning to think for myself. If you haven’t questioned a single thing since the beginning than god bless you because that is true ignorance and it must be bliss.</p>

        <p>The rambling of a little lost sheep. His handler probably wrote everything down for him. People with lack of control over their lives tend to be liberal and democrat. Look how easily they have blindly followed every direction by the government. They should research government atrocities committed on citizens and discover just how little the government cares about its people. They won’t though because that would destroy their beliefs that the government is their lord, guardian and savior. What a pathetic life they live.</p>

        <p>The exact <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormalBan/comments/o7n2wv/how_are_the_people_in_no_new_normal_so/">same question</a> as the post on NNNban that was made 6 hours ago...  Just a coincidence I'm sure.</p>
<p>How are the ideas that come from the sub sometimes contradictory?  We don't enforce uniformity of thought and a lot of people sometimes post wacky stuff most of us don't agree with.  Not to mention, there is a constant stream of fake accounts that just try to post stuff to get us banned like the one yesterday that had a hidden violent message trying to make it past the moderators.</p>

        <p>What do you mean "one supposed death"? The vaccine has killed tens of thousands of people, which is WAY WAY WAY too much for a vaccine. In just the 7 months its been around, it has killed more people than every other vaccine combined within the past 30 years. Not to mention, there's the other hundreds of thousands of people that have experienced adverse effects from it.</p>
<p>That's why we are freaking out about this so-called "vaccine." Vaccines are supposed to help your immune system against a disease, not kill or maim you. There's something truly wrong with the Covid vaccine.</p>

        <p>Apparently you only read propaganda.  You do realize the lab leak is more than likely where the virus originated, right?  They were doing gain of function research with covid in the Wuhan lab.  I bet this is probably new news to you.</p>
<p>Also, I guess you're okay with one person having complete control in your state to arbritrarily pick and choose which businesses can be open, whether or not you can have a party, or tell you whether you can go to a church, mosque, or synagogue.</p>
<p>I'm assuming you're also alright with taking an experimental vaccine which was rushed so fast they skipped the animal trials.  It's not about "one person dying", it's about the potential long term effects.</p>
<p>Maybe you'd know all this if you thought for yourself instead of blindly believing what the propagandistic MSM tells you to believe.   Do your own research.</p>

        <p>It's NOT a vaccine. It's an experimental drug that was released with NO human testing. 90 to 95 percent of the "covid" deaths had 1-3 other factors in the death, like heart disease, advanced cancer and so on.  The chances of dying from just covid are lower than the annual flu. Pull your head out of your ass and do the research before you start insulting those who have done the research. Start with cdc site looking at stats.</p>

        <p>3.9 million old people with multiple co-morbidities have died. They would have died anyway... But there are plenty of people that have died due to the lockdowns, for example UN estimates  that 300k children have died in South-East Asia alone due the lockdowns. None of them were in risk to die due to Covid. Same comes with the vaccines eventually.</p>
