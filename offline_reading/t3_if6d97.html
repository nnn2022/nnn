    <strong>“How Dare You!” Socio-Political Persuasion And Mind Control - Historical Precedents Young And Old. “The Red Flag Act” by Eric Peters.</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.ericpetersautos.com/2020/08/17/the-red-flag-act/">https://www.ericpetersautos.com/2020/08/17/the-red-flag-act/</a>  </p>
<p>Some excerpts:</p>
<p>“...neurotics temporarily got their way more than 100 years ago, when the first cars appeared and threatened the delicate nerves of the velocity averse.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.oceansplasticleanup.com/Politics_Plastics_Oceans_Cleanup/Red_Flag_Act_Locomotive_1865_Cars_Speed_Limits_Man_Running_Carrying_A.htm">Red Flag Acts</a> (including the Highways and Locomotive Act of 1878) imposed a 4 MPH maximum speed limit in the country – 2 MPH in the city –   and required that the vehicle be preceded by a man walking at least 60 yards ahead of it waving a red flag to warn all in the path of the vehicle that it was coming . . . very slowly...</p>
<p>The culture today – or rather, the one that has been manufactured – is embodied in the <em>How Dare You!</em> of the terrorized (and terrifying) sickness psychotic, the shrieking child of climate change, Greta Thunberg.</p>
<p>But she wasn’t selling the right thing.</p>
<p>The sickies in upper management who brought us Greta finally discovered what <em>will</em> sell: Sickness, itself. Not the actuality but the assertion – plus the heavy hand of guilt.</p>
<p>The same principle embodied in “speed kills!” and the <em>How Dare You!</em> shriek of the adolescent termagant – but this time, personalized.</p>
<p><em>You</em> are going to kill granny! You are going to kill <em>me</em>! You are going to kill us <em>all</em>!</p>
<p>That works much better than <em>speed kills! –</em> which is a harder sell because it so obviously doesn’t. You “speed” and nothing happens. But a bug you can’t see? That <em>could</em> be  . . . anywhere? One you might not even know you’ve got it?</p>
<p>Ring that one up...”</p></p>

        <p>SS:</p>
<p>All of Eric Peters’ articles are intelligent, fearless and thought-provoking, but it is in this specific one where I think he really nails the entrainment methods, the predictive/ prescriptive programming and the recent events that played into our acceptance of the COVID hoax.</p>
<p>Thunberg’s iconic and clearly scripted catchphrase is the perfect corollary for the lockdown and mask mind control techniques under which we‘re currently suffering. The conflation of COVID and climate change already in the media seems to bear this out.</p>
