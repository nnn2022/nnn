    <strong>The end game: capturing and controlling human consciousness</strong>
    <p><p>The oncoming worldwide communist technocracy, with 24x7 surveillance and  money replaced by social credit is only an interim step as far as the NWO is concerned. It's an important and essential step in their grand plan, but not the end goal.</p>
<p>The end goal is capturing and controlling the consciousness in all of us, making us half-machines, completely controllable, willing slaves, making the harvesting of our emotional energy a very efficient process.</p>
<p>That task has been assigned to Elon Musk, just like forced vaccination has been assigned to Bill Gates, and creating social unrest is George Soros' responsibility.</p>
<p>I could go into a lot of details, but Tom Montalk has already explained all this very eloquently on his website www.montalk.net.</p>
<p>Also, I don't think the majority of members of this sub is ready for this information yet. So I'll just leave it here. I know there is a small number of members who are aware of what I wrote above.</p>
<p>Corona is just a tiny piece on a chess board that was laid thousands of years ago.</p></p>

        <p>I agree. I know this all sounds crazy to those unaware and unfamiliar with these subjects, but they are true and need to be exposed. I woke up to all of this in 2018 and if you would have told me about any of this prior, I would have thought you were insane. It's a journey but it needs to start somewhere!</p>

        <p>Sure, maybe. I agree with enough of what you say, and respect you saying it. But even if we work on a best intentions assumption, this may still all be the case. There may be validity to the conspiratorial aspects, but I believe waking people up starts much closer to home and the machinations of present reality. 99% of people aren't prepared to hear dives so deep so they immediately shut down, and for all these future possibilities, we're in that hell already right now. I believe our best bet is to stick with what's verifiable and relatable on a mainstream historical basis.</p>

        <p>Look, it's posts like this that makes all of us in this subreddit seem crazy.</p>
<p>I work hard to argue against mask zealots and lockdown fantatics using reason, logic and facts and support my arguments by clearly referencing credible scientific literature I've carefully researched, and lastly I am open to being proven wrong if there is a flaw in my argument</p>
<p>But posts like this... this is what makes our side of the argument lose all credibility. </p>
<p>You might think you're doing us a favour... somehow...  but you're doing the opposite, you're making things a hundred times harder because now my opponents assume I believe crazy conspiracy theories like this one you've posted that conveniently for you cannot be proven or disproven.</p>
<p>Just... stop it. <em>Please?</em></p>

        <p>Is it really so difficult to comprehend?</p>
<p>China successfully implemented their social credit system, why not the rest of the world? Think about it. They'll get to force people to publically have the "right opinions" all the time, if not, those people will get punished. It's the perfect system. Controlfreaks get off on making the people around them act and think the same way they do, because then they'll get their "utopia" (which, of course, is not a utopia at all).</p>
<p>Hell, The Orville and Black Mirror both had episodes revolving around the notion of social credit systems. Note how both episodes end with those systems remaining in place for those societies, too.</p>

        <p>I don't know about the cyborg thing, but the world governments are definitely seeking out more "top down" control, and I think a worldwide social credits system is a part of what they are gunning for, along with a communistic "utopia", and an economic/monetary reset that will benefit the government and the wealthy.</p>

        <p>See, that part of his conspiracy at least has <em>some</em> credibility since there is evidence that things like social credit systems work, and there is a very vocal number of people who certainly want a communist utopia, so if this was all that his theory was then I would have let it pass.</p>
<p>But when he started ranting on about a global plot to turn us into cyborgs and to steal our thoughts or some shit <em>when he has no evidence of this plot</em> he instantly lost any and all credibility.</p>

        <p>Eh. A lot of people, including in this sub, don't believe there's any sort of governmental corruption whatsoever, that the political leaders acting together to initiate an agenda is impossible. I just...don't understand. With everything going on right now, I think we should be more open to any possibility. Nothing has felt right about this from the beginning, to me. I think, right now, they are most definitely trying to "reset" society. They don't even hide that, just read the various documents posted here that continue to push the "new normal", "building back better", "we need a reset", etc.</p>

        <p>No, you can't be open to "any" possibility. You can only be open to "plausible" possibilities, as indicated by the available evidence and historical comparisons. Otherwise if you're open to "any" possibility you might as well claim that aliens are spreading covid to see if humans can resist the harsh environment of the planet Vorgon so we can be used to fight their battles against the giant beetle creatures from Septi 6.</p>
<p>There is no evidence or historical comparison to indicate that a handful of global elites want to turn us into cyborgs to harvest out energy. Anyone suggesting this idea with no evidence is a moron.</p>
<p>It's not even an original idea, it's just a rip off of The Matrix films. Perhaps OP doesn't realise these films are fiction and not documentaries.</p>

        <p>Not sure how people can continue to believe there's nothing else going on here, that the whole situation we're in is just the product of politicians making "boo boos" and trying to "placate" the hysterical masses. If that was the case, the government would've stepped in way sooner during other such scenarios of hysteria and public panic. No, they're trying to pull something and change society on a grand scale, thus why the world governments are mostly acting in conjuction with each other. </p>
<p>Again, I don't know about the cyborg stuff being true, but who knows. Nothing about this shit has sat right with me from the get-go. Funny. I warned people back in March that this would never last two weeks, and everyone mocked me, and some even did those stupid "remind me" counters to prove me wrong. Whoopsie!

        <p>Well, do you have proof that the government isn't colluding on this? Do you have 100% concrete evidence that something nefarious <em>isn't</em> going on? Just saying, we could make arguments either way here. Though my conclusion, after looking at everything that I've seen posted on here, on other websites, videos on Youtube, commentary from experts, and so on is that there is something happening, and the governments of the world seem to be working together to change society, including rolling out programs that will erode privacy and exert more control on the population, such as contact tracing, health passports, etc.</p>

        <p>Nah this is all about different types of nerds doing their thing, even in China. Elon musk for example is just a nerd...where i worry about getting my dick sucked and eating steak he worries about flying cars so that is what ends up happening because where i worry about payibg for a good steak many people worry about buying a good Tesla hence empowering the nerd....same reasoning applies to religion, politics etc</p>

        <p>I'm not saying that your ideas are definitely wrong - who knows, maybe you're right - but by the very definition of the phrase "conspiracy theory", what you are saying categorically <em>is</em> a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>If you want to give credibility to your ideas you need to support them with verifiable, falsifiable evidence. Furthermore, you need to give evidence why the conventional explanations of things are false. You've done neither. That is why your ideas are <em>in</em>credible and why anyone can - and probably should - ignore your ideas.</p>

        <p>The magic vaccine is an excuse, just like the "two weeks to flatten the curve". I think you were right the first time about them intending to make this permanent. The solution, however, is for the majority of people to stand up and fight back...which is not really happening yet (or maybe ever...).</p>
<p>I think, if they do implement microchips, it will be later on as an extension of the "health passports" they are already trying to push onto people. "These microchips will be much easier and accessible! Instead of using your phone, just swipe your hand on a machine! Oh, and now people can't opt out of being scanned and checked for their vaccination records!" It'd just be more surveillance and erosion of privacy that's already begun. It's really not even a "sci fi conspiracy theory bullshit" idea. Bill Gates himself even spoke about "digital passports" and microchips as well.</p>

        <p>Humanity being united against a cause can make change happen. The problem is that people are splintered off, and seem to believe nothing nefarious is going on, and even embrace the potential social change that's to come. So if people don't fight back then nothing's going to happen, and things will proceed on as they are.</p>

        <p>Yes, this has been symbolized through the ages by the pentagram. The pentagram with the star pointing upward represents freedom. The spirit rising up toward heaven and divinity while still captured within the five elements. </p>
<p>The pentagram pointing down represents imprisonment, the building of more and more complex systems of control and imprisonment.</p>

        <p>I consider myself a “conspiracy analyst” and am very open to things like this. I follow David Icke and this site you’ve shared seems to mirror a lot of what he talks about. It all seems to lead to Gnosticism and archons. I am interested in learning more about “energy farming” and loosh, I believe it’s called as this really resonates with me right now.</p>
<p>But having said that, I’m not sure everyone on here fighting for their civil liberties is willing or ready to go down such a deep rabbit hole. And I think that’s okay too. We need people who are fighting with just the tangible facts and reason just as much as we need people who are starting to wake up and realize the truth of what’s really going on. Just as we can’t let religion, politics, gender, race, etc divide us in our quest for justice and freedom, there needs to be a place for “conspiracy theorists” as well IMHO. It’s just another viewpoint along the way to our same goal of resisting tyranny. </p>
<p>James Corbett might be easier for people to digest, he is a conspiracy journalist but he only argues with undeniable factual information.</p>

        <p>Glad to see people like you are on this sub... I knew there were a few who are clued up on the metaphysical side (i.e. the main side) of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>I agree that this is not everyone's cup of tea, but at the same time some people on this sub might just need this initial nudge in the shape of a post like mine to then seek out and explore the rest of the knowledge.</p>
<p>I have followed David Icke for a long time before switching to Montalk. While Icke focuses more on the 3D conspiracies, Montalk is one of the very few people in the world who researches the higher-density and negative hierarchy side and shows how the 3D conspiracies actually originate out of the higher-density control structure. Also, he has an extraordinary capability of making extremely complex subjects digestable.</p>
