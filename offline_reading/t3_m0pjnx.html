    <strong>An idea</strong>
    <p><p>So I have been thinking about things lately and although I have only been on this sub for a short while, I have been active over in the conspiracy subs for many years. It seems that there are a lot of extremely discontented individuals over here and I would say for very good reason. But I am not so sure the constant posting of information, sometimes slightly repetitively is going to get any real traction in the real world. Not to say that information spreading is not essential. It is. </p>
<p>So imagine you have a company, I am going to use the example of Quantas Airlines because the CEO has openly said that he will require vaccines for flight. Let's say you disagree with this policy and you feel you would like to say something about it. Well organisation is the key. On the front page it says that there are around 44,000 members in this sub alone. There are other subs like this one, with similar, if not more members that would be sympathetic to the causes of this sub. </p>
<p>I just checked and on TripAdvisor Quantas only has about 19k reviews total. It has taken them years to get them and their average rating is currently 4 stars. Now, I am not saying that people should lie or spam or fraudulently write a bad faith reviews on TripAdvisor but it seems to me that with some degree of organisation, the Gamestop phenomenon could quite easily be transferable to a review site. The people making the review would be real and hold a genuine grievance, whether it be first hand, reaction to a video that was posted that made them upset or unhappy or based on company policy such as mask mandates or a vaccine only policy.</p>
<p>If the mods ensure visibility and promotion of an idea like this, and the front page could be organised to a wide enough audience, many, many people could be convinced to make public their genuine feelings on review sites such as trip advisor.</p>
<p>Anyway. I am not suggesting anything illegal or malicious, just a method of making the companies that adopt authoritarian policies accountable to their customers or potential customers that deserve a voice.</p>
<p>Apologies if this has been suggested before.</p></p>

        <p>You're on the right track; it needs to be painful to the big businesses, who hold the power. But collectively, we can, if organized, make a difference. But then again, maybe not, because the world leaders have banded together on this one</p>

        <p>No world leader could or will ever stand on top of the masses. The masses is the sleeping giant. And they are afraid of us uniting. We can exist without these so called leaders. They cannot exist without us. Problem is for us to be united. Because pretty much on every social platform we are censored and the media is controlled by these elites. Hence keeping us separated and unable to unite further. Just my 2 cents</p>

        <p>When they are de-facto forcing us to take an experimental vaccine (7 produced in the space of a year, still no cure for AIDS....etc) And that vaccine is being shown to have SEVERE effects, i think we're fucked personally.</p>

        <p>That's a good idea, can't belive a lot people didn't band together before and leave reviews with information on mask and distancing policies with out feelings on them. That would definitely leave a mark if people don't like it and start speaking up. And yes it would have to be done together because censorship is going to happen if only a small number of people do. An easy way to get people going to stores that let people be free and avoid those that don't.</p>
