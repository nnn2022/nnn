        <p>Maybe that is because real information and knowledge steers those who posses and can analyze it properly AWAY from the narrative that they are attempting to draw everyone into believing. Here they make a limited admission, in slightly different jargon, that they have to double down on the attempt to psychologically manipulate those of us still sane enough to see through their bullshit</p>

        <p>Alongside peer pressure/social pressure they only have to use endless marketing, repetition, and the "right words" to placate one group. They'll never be able to finesse messaging to apply to both. Then again, they don't need to.</p>

        <p>What blows my mind is that they think the missing ingredient here is just a better PR campaign. Their proposal in a nutshell is that you can just brush aside the well-informed concerns of highly intelligent individuals with mere <em>positive sounding language</em>, as you would with a toddler. I just find it impossible to process this level of sheer incompetence.</p>

        <p>The people implementing these mandates or spreading fear/misinformation clearly are not smart themselves. So maybe they genuinely believe we could be manipulated that easily, just like they know they would be. They’re too stupid to even understand our point of view. Basically, they have monkey brains</p>
<p>Actually no, that’s offensive to monkeys, because monkeys are smarter than them</p>

        <p>SICK, thanks for sharing. i found the text below it more intriguing.</p>
<p>Three messages that have been used effectively 
by vaccine-hesitant communities are choice, 
regret and control. Scholars suggest these might 
be flipped to reduce vaccine hesitancy. 
Paul Slovic, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology at the 
University of Oregon and founder and president 
of Decision Research, suggested the potential 
effectiveness of regret: “Wouldn’t you regret
if you did not get the vaccine and you or your 
loved ones got ill and you had decided not to 
get it?” Kurt Gray, Ph.D., Associate Professor in 
Psychology and Neuroscience at the University 
of North Carolina, said it’s important to offer this 
in a positive sense and focus on the benefits 
of the vaccine with concrete stories. People in 
the vaccine hesitant community often point to 
their regret in having their children vaccinated, 
attributing specific side effects to that choice. 
than being more focused on the potential side 
effects of the vaccine.”
Paul Slovic pointed out that “one of the things 
that makes COVID scary is that it’s difficult 
to control.” It’s invisible, people can carry 
and transmit the disease without showing 
symptoms, and there are limited treatment 
options. People have profound discomfort 
with uncertainty, and so offering the vaccine 
in the context of regaining control could be 
quite powerful. 
Choice factors in, in three ways. People may 
worry they will be forced to get a vaccine. 
They may worry that they won’t have access to 
the vaccine, and therefore rationalize its likely 
effectiveness. The third is that people may feel 
platforms where people are sharing concerns 
about vaccines. Understanding the reasons 
behind people’s skepticism will help you 
design messages that overcome them. As 
Heidi Larson points out, rumours and 
misinformation flourish when there’s broad, 
shared curiosity and an information vacuum. 
Listen to questions and fears and provide 
detailed and meaningful answers.
Heidi Larson pointed out how the regret angle 
is really important to leverage, because it’s 
something that parents really struggle with. 
“There is a very proactive influential anti-HPV 
vaccine group in Ireland called “R.E.G.R.E.T.. 
It’s about Gardasil. It’s Reactions and Effects of 
Gardasil Resulting in Extreme Trauma. Regret 
can be leveraged in different ways, On the one 
hand you can say, ‘You don’t want to regret not 
vaccinating if your child gets encephalitis or 
other serious condition from measles disease.’ 
But many parents are also anticipating the 
possible regret if they do vaccinate and there is 
a problem, ‘Yeah, but what happens if he gets 
autism from the vaccine?’ Regret is an important 
dimension in conversations with parents, but the 
important thing is to shift the anticipated regret 
towards how they might feel if their child is not 
vaccinated and becomes seriously ill or even 
dies from a vaccine preventable disease rathe</p>

        <p>Has this ever happened to you?</p>
<p>You're in a discussion, and you give a great point about the potential dangers of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Then, you get descended upon by dozens of screaming people, who tell you to "do your research".</p>
<p>They'll say something like, "dig deeper than just YouTube or mom's Facebook group".</p>
<p>Then, right after that, they'll post a YouTube video made for children about vaccines and say, "see?  It's so simple a child could understand it."</p>
<p>How many times has that happened to you?</p>
<p>Do they not understand the irony of screaming at someone to "do their research" while they themselves have not done the research?</p>
<p>Do they not see the irony of saying "look further than YouTube"; then using a YouTube video made for children to prove their point?</p>
<p>I'm sure they don't see the irony. </p>
<p>Because these are people who don't really seem to pay attention to anything.</p>
<p>And yet, for whatever reason.  We now live in a world where these people are considered "educated", while those of us who have actually read books, looked at studies, and who have talked to multiple sources, are "conspiracy theorists".</p>
<p>It is insane.  I feel like I'm living in Loony Land.  Everyone has lost their minds.  Crazy stuff.</p>
