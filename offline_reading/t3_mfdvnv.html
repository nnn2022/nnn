        <p>We have 2 options right now: 1. Bow down and take the new wave socialism and become enslaved with no human rights. or 2. fight back, get pushed back even more and probably fall in the process but at least stand for something you believe in! take your pick!</p>

        <p>I'm going with option two, I tell myself everyday I have no choice. I absolutely cannot tolerate option one. My eyes are too open and I see what this is. I almost wish I wasn't aware of this it's so hard to watch. It's very painful. I look at people that think everything is fine and we're just going to go back to normal life and I wish I had that sort of naivete. I was just sitting here thinking about the whole passport thing because I'm in New York, and I was talking to a friend who said he doesn't think it's is going to be successful. He said he thinks the government has grossly underestimated people and that there's going to be far more push back than they have anticipated. I wish I could have this perspective but it feels pretty hopeless right now. I used to be very anti-gun, now I'm looking around me at all the world events especially what's going on in Myanmar right now and I'm realizing this is exactly why people need to be armed. Even if you don't use your weapon the government knowing people are armed keeps things in check a little bit more.</p>

        <p>Many things. Chronic use of antibiotics, chemotherapy medication like HIV medication which is Ziduvidine. Malnutrition, starvation, contaminated water. The problem with medicine is that they want to simplify disease with ONE CAUSE: ONE DISEASE: ONE CURE.  </p>
<p>There are many lectures and papers written on this.</p>
<p>Also AIDS is not a specific condition and does not have a specific diagnosis so you cannot state what causes AIDS in all cases.</p>

        <p>&rt;Many people have injected themselves with HIV on camera and in front of journalists.</p>
<p>Name five.  </p>
<p>&rt;Many people who were diagnosed with HIV went on to quit their medication and never got sick again.</p>
<p>There are a number of folks with a mutation in the receptor for HIV who never progress to AIDS.    In fact, they have successfully cured AIDS by using those people's bone marrow for stem cell transplants.  </p>
<p>But anyway, no, unless you have that ccr5 mutation, you will get aids if you get HIV.</p>

        <p>Dr. Zuger was one of the first to inject himself in the 80s and hes still alive today at 71. Robert willner has done it multiple times in front of press. https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2y8vmz </p>
<p>CCR5 mutation  hypothesis is completely theoretical. It was based on the premise of why some people with a positive HIV test, who didnt take medication, went on to be completely fine. Hence, the detection off ccr5 alleles proved to be wildly unsuccessful at explaining this phenomenon. </p>

<p>What you need is a pile of HIV positive folks wo AIDS who are carry the wild type CCR5 alleles.  That will honestly convince me, and it should be what's required to convince anyone.</p>

        <p>There is only one definitive experiment that will empiraclly prove/disprove HIV/AIDS hypothesis. 1 group HAART therapy, 1 group placebo, evaluate and observe for 15-20 years for mortality as the clinical endpoint marker. If there is no difference, then you know without a shadow of a doubt that the hypothesis is false.  This experiment has been pushed by many scientists to come to fruition however it is always denied and deeemed too unethical.  </p>
<p>I honestly don't blame you for having a hard time being convinced, everyone should have a higher threshold for bullshit, but never discount a hypothesis before it's answered.  </p>

        <p>No need to compare HAART to placebo. The experiment I listed is all that's needed.  Just show me a bunch of HIV positive folks who never progress to AIDS but have wt ccr5.  You should ask yourself why those aids deniers only ever prick their fingers - why have they not gotten a pint or two of blood, seroconverted on purpose and foreswore triple therapy?  They should be anxious to do so, and it's really easy to do so.</p>
<p>Yeah, I actually got my PhD in duesbergs department in Berkeley.  I've seen this a million times, and talked to Peter more than once.  One of my classmates actually challenged him to infuse himself, and he got angry and changed the subject. He won't do it, he's a coward.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what's going on with Peter: he wanted to get the Nobel, worked on DNA viruses that cause cancer, and was devastated when HIV came along and took away all of his funding in the 80s.  His lab was pathetic.  </p>
<p>Anyway, get me that pile of HIV+ non AIDS wt CCR5 folks and we'll get the Nobel.  Until then, you have to admit that the data we have are consistent with HIV causing AIDS.</p>

        <p>That's quite the imagination you have.  Does your fantasy LARP help you to better reinforce your beliefs?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What you wrote makes it clear you have no clue what you are talking about. First of all  there doesnt exist an accurate way of measuring genetic mutation of ccr5 alleles but more importantly its quite impossible to correlate the presence of mutation with the expression of CCR5 receptors.</p>
<p>ALSO the detection of the homozygous ccr5 mutation in subjects with HIV/AIDS has already been observed. Which is a big reason this hypothesis has never been further explored and genetic screening of CCR5 has been thrown on the backburner.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9256936/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9256936/</a> Wheres my Nobel Prize?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also, Peter did get the nobel prize, but you would know that if you knew even a fraction of what you were talking about. He had the option of rescinding his hypothesis and all would be forgiven, but unlike you, a little weasel with no integrity,  he held on to his and stood by what he said about the HIV/AIDS fraud. People like peter are rare, one of the few who sacrificed everything to stand by what he believes in. Meanwhile, a basement dwelling redditor such as yourself has the guts to make up lies and discredit others. Go fuck yourself.</p>

<p>Nope -</p>

<p>His name ain't here.  If he had, I'd know it, because when Randy Scheckman (our old chair) won it, my alumni association went crazy.  Same thing when Jim Alison won it.  There were and are lots of great people in MCB, and Duesberg is an embarrassment to all of them.  They gave him the dirtiest lab space possible, for a good reason.</p>

        <p>His work in the 70s on dna viruses was great. That definitely got him into the academy. Again, he lost his mind in a fit of "who moved my cheese" when all funding went to HIV in the 80s.  Instead of writing a good grant on HIV, he decided to say everyone else was wrong.  But just to refocus, he clearly does believe that HIV causes AIDS, otherwise he'd seroconvert himself and prove us all wrong.  Barry marshal (whom I don't know personally, unlike Peter) was brave enough</p>

        <p>Except that he was inducted into NAS in 1986 and received major grants up until 1987 from the NIH. He had one of the biggest labs in the country and was by far the most prominent virologist in the field becoming a scholar in residence in 1987 at NIH. The same year, 1987, he came out against his HIV/AIDS hypothesis all his grants were taken away and his lab was taken him from him as well. He was tenured so they couldnâ€™t take his teaching position. Thatâ€™s not a case of a man going nuts...also considering they offered him to rescind his statement in return of everything taken from him. </p>
<p>He states that HIV does not cause AIDS as does Kary Mullis, and Luc Montagnier. </p>
<p>Also you do not know Peter personally or have a PhD judging from this conversation. Itâ€™s great that you enjoy making things up in the internet but thatâ€™s the nature of the beast after all. Nothing new.</p>

<p>He may have had a big lab in the 80s, I wasn't there then.  But he was definitely not the most prominent virologist, sorry.  That title definitely went to Baltimore, Temin and even Peter's very good friend and next door neighbor Rubin.  Temin may have died by then, I don't recall.  But no way was Peter the most prominent virologist in the county at any point.</p>
