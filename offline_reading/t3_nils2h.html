        <p>This is the thing with many of the people who have been made deranged by politics, tech companies, and the media. Many of them can be otherwise normal, like the women at the beginning of the conversation. I mean, at this point it’s basically programming. They’ve folded so much propaganda into their own identity, so any dissent they see is an attack on their core, which is why they lash out. Like, in the 1930s, otherwise normal people were programmed to believe the Jews and other “uncleans” were responsible for the terrible state of affairs in Germany, and these beliefs became immutable, because dissent was stifled systematically. People who would otherwise not do an unkind thing were led into horrible acts, because in their minds, they were doing it for the greater good.</p>

        <p>Yeah the vaccines that don't provide immunity are going to bring "herd immunity"--just one of their many lies. I felt the anger coming off the few people I talked about the vaccines with. No one told me off, but I could tell a few wanted to. [via email/pms] People are scared to death and this fear has allowed them to be brainwashed. The isolation and the rest of what they have done to us is basic trauma programming. I believe almost the entire population has been STOCKHOLMED.</p>

<p>a) hadn't shaken the hand of another person in over a year,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>b) had such a severe case of terminal TDS that they developed ulcers? Like WHO DEVELOPS ULCERS FOR SOMEONE THAT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXIST!?!?!?</p>

        <p>What I have come to realize about thes people is that there is absolutely no rationalizing or reasoning with them. The programming is so deep. It’s as if the part of their brain responsible for common sense/ logic has been fire-walled off. I have lost friends of over two decades simply because I don’t share all of their opinions on lockdowns/ Covid/ vaccines. People that I thought were intelligent and compassionate have turned into rabid animals that have wished my death for simply asking questions. It’s sad but I accept that I cannot change their minds. They have chosen their path, which is their right, but it’s also my right not to live in a constant state of manufactured fear.</p>

        <p>I mean your phones front camera is infinitely better than any laptop camera would be. Portrait filming is pretty terrible though.</p>
<p>Definitely amazing she kept calm in that. I’m pretty sure if someone was getting aggressive and yelling at me like that someone would be leaving in an ambulance</p>

        <p>It’s so hard to believe people really feel that way. I’ve fortunately been surrounded by friends, family, and a community, who mostly think rationally on this subject since the start of it all. Aside from wearing a mask in the grocery store, my lifestyle hasn’t changed a bit...still hugging friends and family, still going to church, still taking the kids to dance classes, etc. </p>
<p>But then I have online friends who were just lamenting in a gc today that they’re “still gonna wear a mask in walmart even though they’re vaccinated” and “don’t wanna look like a conservative if they take their mask off”....I’ve seen these radical thoughts showcased on Reddit, but it was disheartening to learn I actually know and socialize with people who think that way. I’m worried too many people think this way. </p>
<p>Another reason I appreciate this sub so much...makes me feel less alone.</p>
