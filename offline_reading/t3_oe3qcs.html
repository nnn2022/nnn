        <p>Yep. If vaccines are so trustworthy, why were vaccine manufacturers granted zero legal liability from 1986 onward? Why do taxpayers compensate victims through the vaccine injury court system? Why is compensation typically attached to a court-issued gag order?</p>

<p>those basic questions + the addition of the fact, that no vaccine ever went through a longterm inert placebo controlled double blind, big enough, randomized safety study should be enough to have any sane mind avoid all vaccines from that point on.</p>

        <p>Peanut butter makers aren't held liable for someone having an allergic reaction. </p>
<p>If someone intentionally created a vaccine to be harmful they wouldn't be protected. This is literally how almost every ingestible/consumable food or medication is given protection, it isn't mutually exclusive to vaccines.</p>

        <p>Johnson and Johnson didn't intend their baby powder to cause harm, but they still got slammed with a major lawsuit since they didn't do their due diligence with the facts they had available. Medical companies are sued all the time for negative effects they did not intend - because the products were not tested adequately, people were not informed of potential effects properly, etc.</p>
<p>It's funny that you should bring up allergies because nobody is given a list of the ingredients in a vaccine and told to be tested to determine if they're allergic - but they ARE told they should be vaccinated no matter what. Most people aren't even informed of potential side effects beyond a sore arm etc. Foods containing common allergens have warning labels on them, but vaccines don't. Not to mention vaccines are a drug and can have plenty of side effects that have nothing to do with whether a person is allergic to anything.</p>
<p>If all foods and medications are protected the same way, why the 1986 act of law and the creation of a special vaccine injury court?</p>

        <p>Because vaccines are required to attend school or participate in public sports. </p>
<p>Nobody requires you to eat peanut butter to do those things. </p>
<p>As for J&amp;J, we had their vaccine discontinued for concerns and not meeting standards. </p>
<p>Lastly we know all the ingredients in vaccines, it is in every pamphlet and handout. We don't test for allergies to them for the same reason we don't do blanket allergy tests for everyone, it's not cost effective and it is unlikely someone will have an reaction. I've never had an allergy panel in my life, and I'm not sure I'll ever need one because I've never had adverse reactions to any foods.</p>

        <p>Like eating peanut butter, vaccines should not be required to attend school. It's a terrible idea. No one should be required to ingest any food or inject any drug to receive their mandatory education. That's the most basic violation of bodily autonomy there is. Not to mention vaccine exemptions are available, and failing that, homeschool.</p>
<p>The law does not decide what is good, right, or rational. There are plenty of bad laws, like homeschooling being illegal in Germany or adulterers being stoned to death in the Middle East. What's even more ridiculous is that voters have no say (and receive no info) over vaccine policy or which vaccines should be required. We don't elect CDC officials, and they aren't accountable if things go wrong. I say no vaccination without representation.</p>
<p>I didn't know the J&amp;J vaccine was discontinued in the USA because it's being widely used here in Korea. I suspect Pfizer and Moderna are trying to achieve a monopoly. Of course Pfizer has had close ties to the government for a long time so I think it'll be easy for them to eliminate the competition. I don't trust a company that's racked up over $1 billion in penalties for government contracting offenses since 2000.</p>

<p>It's not like the mRNA-vaccines do exactly the same thing other vaccines do: Make the body fight a harmless version of the original virus and make it produce memory cells so a later infection with the actual harmful virus can be fought off rather easily.</p>

        <p>I don't have any questions about mRNA vaccines because the issue really has no relationship to mRNA vaccines. The issue is that, outside of irrational fears and coerced views manufactured by those who are demonstrably working to harm us, there is no existing concern that causes the vaccines to be of any actual relevance to anyone. So when you come in here promoting mRNA vaccines, I don't have a problem because I'm scared of the vaccines, or because I have some mistaken understanding of the vaccines. The vaccines are nothing. The reason I have the problem is because your only function is to do the will of those who seek to harm us.</p>

<p>I’m not promoting or attacking mRNA vaccines I’m just offering my experience for anybody who wishes to understand them. I think it would be a lot less scary to people if they knew what was going on and why.</p>

        <p>The body never see the harmless virus with mRNA. mRNA is messenger DNA and that is injected into your skeletal muscle that when your cells split (mitosis) they now have special code to create the spike protein with no off switch till the cell that has had the mRNA dies off and never replicates again.</p>
<p>A common vaccine like the flu shot is not mRNA and is like what you stated above. A weakened or dead virus that the body uses it’s natural immune response to create the needed anti body. The body will forget the anti body over time if it is never triggered ( you get sick)</p>

        <p>Well since viruses are not categorised as living beings and are literally nothing but RNA in a protein capsule you can say that a part of the viruses RNA, the one that has the spike protein encoded in them, is a harmless version of the original virus (RNA plus capsule). Harmless because the bodies reaction to contamination with this version is not dangerous for us. And the mRNA vaccines we use work the same way as usual vaccines: Getting the mRNA into the body cells, make them produce the spike proteins, let them detect those as foreign proteins, let them produce antibodies and defence cells. This creates a protective immune response.</p>

        <p>You do realize we don't actually know what happens inside our cells at a molecular level. It is all just models and abstractions. Humans cannot observe the mechanisms active inside cells. Its just not on a scale we can sense with technology or our body. </p>
<p>Science is a very powerful tool we use to refine our models and abstractions of things we cannot directly observe. We never finish the science. We will never just stop researching and discovering new things. The objective reality is not for humans to behold, not at this time. </p>
<p>Just because we are currently unaware of any mechanism that can make the conversation from mRNA to DNA does not mean it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>The evidence of my claims is that there are still people doing research you fucking fool. I don't remember when the universities all closed thier research labs because science is finished you clown.</p>

        <p>No mrna is not genetic material. Dna is genetic material that rests in the nucleus. In order to actually effect what happens in the cell it must split itself, copy  a single instruction and send that to a ribosome in the cell. The ribosome uses the code to literally build a chain of amino acids into a protein that the cell can use. This instruction is called Messenger Rna or mrna. It is a single instruction given to ribosomes to produce the spike protein that covid uses to pierce a cell. Once the body identifies these spike proteins it builds a response to them that lasts and protects you against the spike proteins in covid itself. Mrna cannot effect your dna and the mrna in the vaccine could not even come close to the dna stored inside the nucleus</p>

        <p>I don't think its a bad idea to be cautious of new technology. I really hope the drugs are perfect and safe. I just think its silly to deny the possibility (no matter how small) that they are not.</p>

        <p>Its not fear. Its called being patient. I can wait the years necessary to vet the process stability and quality control. If you cannot wait that is your problem.</p>
<p>I will not gamble my health. Want to count how many different vaccines are available? </p>
<p>https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/09/health/fda-approval-drug-events-study/index.html</p>
<p>https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/05/09/527575055/one-third-of-new-drugs-had-safety-problems-after-fda-approval</p>
<p>&rt;It took a <strong>median of 4.2 years</strong> after the drugs were approved for these safety concerns to come to light, the study found, and issues were more common among psychiatric drugs, biologic drugs, <strong>drugs that were granted "accelerated approval"</strong> and drugs that were approved near the regulatory deadline for approval.</p>
<p>1/3 of new drugs that are biological or granted accelerated approval get recalled after a medium of 4.2 years. </p>
<p>One of these vaccines are quite likely to be recalled in 4.2 years. I'll wait and see what options are left before making a decision.</p>

        <p>Wow great way to talk about things in a civil manner. I have seen doctors saying the vaccine is bad and covid isn’t as bad as they say. Why are your doctors more right than mine? There is so much misinformation on both sides. Can’t you see that? How are you so sure you are right? You nor I are doctors, and the medical field isn’t an exact science. If the medical field was exact then we wouldn’t have had to change they way we do things so many times over the years.</p>

        <p>Nope, I don’t find it strange. It is new technology and that’s why the definition expanded.</p>
<p>Similar to how google used to mean nothing before say 1999. </p>

        <p>My comment is literally logical information. Here’s an example to help you understand! </p>
<p>When cameras were first invented, the definition was likely something along the lines of, “A device that produces an image on a polished silver surface bearing a coating of silver halide particles, deposited by iodine bromide.” Now, should we keep that definition today, over 100 years later? No; any rationally thinking person would realize that camera technology has changed over time, as did the definition. Do you believe that’s some sort of agenda being pushed by camera salesmen?</p>
<p>The fact that I’m even explaining how words work to another real human being is actually baffling to me.</p>

        <p>My immediate thought was to refer to television technology. They used to use cathode ray guns that would cause the screen to glow, but the new ones use an entirely different method of achieving the exact same goal. Camera are also a really good example tho</p>

        <p>It didn’t get removed- they moved that part to the beginning of the definition and are now listing two cases as to how this happens (a, b)</p>
<p>Which is the reason for the expansion of the definition in the first place- there is now two types of vaccine, where before there was only one</p>

        <p>Of course there's a difference.  One grants more of a foothold to engage in meaningless pedantry for people who have already arrived at a conclusion no amount of reason and logic will convince them out of. You. I'm talking about you. mRNA vaccines are a vastly new technology (deployed out of sheer necessity because of the dangers of a virus experts have foreseen for decades, warnings ignored by everone until it was too late). A change in definitions is a given. Necessity is the mother of invention (i.e. nukes, cold war, space race). If you want to argue that you don't trust something that was deemed ok to use so quickly even though the vaccine development cycles  take years then that's a perfectly valid concern. But to say that it's fishy and therefore undeniably and obviously some conspiracy is pure lunacy.</p>

        <p>I simply think more research and understanding is needed about the mRNA vaccines is needed before they start to be given to everyone. We should have relied on traditional methods first, and then after 2 or so years start giving the mRNA ones to everyone if they are indeed effective and safe.</p>

        <p>‘Stimulating the body’s immune response to a specific infectious disease’, while it may seem innocuous and synonymous, is decidedly NOT the same as ‘produce or artificially increase immunity to a specific infectious disease’.</p>
<p>I chose an auto immune disorder as my example for this exact reason. A stimulated immune response is not inherently a good thing, but immunity toward infection is. A cytokine storm is a stimulated immune response for instance. Trust me, you do not want that sort of stimulation my friend.</p>

        <p>because it accomplishes the same goal in a similar way. Similar to how a steamship, a galley, and a galleon are all called ships despite using different methods of propulsion. Though pre-industrial-revolution definitions may have stated that a ship uses sails or oars, that was ultimately determined to be auxiliary to what makes a ship a ship. When a new ship came along which used neither of those things it was still very clearly a ship.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the effort you put into the analogy, but it's a false one, I think.  I see the mRNA injection as, say, an airplane... something different enough from a ship that it needs its own definition.  I think the term "vaccine" was changed and applied to the new technology to squash skepticism and improve acceptance.</p>

        <p>Well what about TVs? Old tvs worked COMPLETELY differently to new ones, the only thing that has stayed consistent has been the purpose. They used to use cathode ray guns fired at a phosphorescent screen based on analogue signals sent via antenna. Nowadays pretty much ever single part of the process has changed and yet we still call them TVs. It's about the use case and purpose.</p>

        <p>Because in the minds of basically everyone, a vaccine is a shot that gives you resistance to some disease or virus. Since new mNRA technique does exactly that (gives resistance to disease via a shot) it doesn’t make sense to give it a new name when the old name is perfectly descriptive and widely recognized</p>

        <p>Most vaccines no longer fit that description. I'm surprised they didn't change it before - most vaccines use antigens. The antigens used in the flu vaccine are actually grown in fertilized chicken eggs</p>

        <p>Well yeah, it's called natural immunity. That's why people who have been exposed to Sars-cov2 then are immune for some period of time.</p>
<p>Edit: the difference with vaccination is that to be a vaccine it needs to be prepared specifically for it, as written in the definition. Also, vaccines don't contain the virus etc etc</p>

        <p>As many people are curious about vaccines during these times, It’s understandable that many would search about it to learn more. The previous definition isn’t exactly understandable to someone who knows nothing about vaccines. The second definition is literally the same thing, just in simpler terms. What’s the issue here?</p>

        <p>The definition with simpler terms is the shorter definition.  They double the length of the definition and leave out immunity. Because vaccines don’t need to do “immunity” anymore.</p>

        <p>So you’re saying someone who knows absolutely nothing about vaccines could read the first definition and understand it? Or someone who doesn’t speak english well? The first definition says a vaccine increases immunity but leaves out how. The second definition explains that a vaccine triggers the body’s immune response and provides a link to what that means. They still mean the same, the second definition is just better by all means.</p>

        <p>Television is a term for transmitting images. The method of transmitting the signal and receiving it is important, the method of rendering the image is not. If the vaccine did not use a syringe, or was a gas or a solid somehow, it would still be considered a vaccine if it had attenuated virus.</p>

        <p>Wrong. We define terms as they are useful to us. There is really no such thing as a definition outside of human language.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia - In diachronic (or historical) linguistics, semantic change is a change in one of the meanings of a word. ... Every word has a variety of senses and connotations, which can be added, removed, or altered over time, often to the extent that cognates across space and time have very different meanings.</p>
<p>Definitions of words are not static or absolute, that is a ridiculous idea.</p>

        <p>Languages change with large population gradually changing them. Establishment of protocol and literary languages with codified rules and terminology slows this process down significantly. Changing the rules by an order, without even any prior processes designed to figure out whether change is necessary and appropriate, and then presenting the new rules as the only rules which ever existed, constitutes an intrusive method of control over the people's thought processes, and is, by definition, totalitarian.</p>

        <p>Yeah. The Problem is there was no “rule” that they had to change the definition. They just updated it because of a significant scientific breakthrough. Nobody is trying to deny to the public or gaslight people into thinking that this new definition is the only one that has ever existed. Science changes quickly, and there have always been people dragging their feet as science progresses. Currently that if you.</p>
<p>It’s not a method of control over people, any more than any definition in the dictionary is. By your logic you could argue literally any scientific breakthrough is a totalitarian overhaul of conventional thought before that breakthrough. </p>
<p>I’m curious, how do you know that this definition was changed because of an order coming from an authoritarian body?</p>

Covid pass would never exist, might exist, will exist. So many different information, coming from the same media and new outlets ... And you call this is, disinformation? ... LOL. Go tell mainstream media to make their mind up, about what is the "real" information ...</p>

        <p>Masks were never actually useless or dangerous. There has been scientific evidence that they work for decades, hence surgeons have been wearing them long before the pandemic. The US government has stated they do not want to create a vaccine passport and have stayed consistent about that. You guys come up with something that you already feel is true, and then just keep shouting that it's true at anyone who tries to prove it.</p>

<p>That is what they said on national news in 2020 :D</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;There has been scientific evidence that they work for decades</p>
<p>Yes, they work well against blood splatters when a surgeon opens his patient. Protective eye glasses also work well against blood splatters :) They don't prevent virus or bacteria. That's why patients that get open chest surgery also get antibiotics and antivirals.</p>

<p>The US isn't the center of the world :D I'm not from the US.</p>

<p>They talked about covid passports in the national news, on teevee ... \^\^ It started with "no no no", followed by "It could be handy", now we re in the "it will exist but won't be mandatory" ... we all know next step right? ...</p>

        <p>Masks work for airborne droplets. It's well established, and well known. You can continue to believe that tiny drops of water can go through multiple layers of cloth if you feel like though, I can't stop you from being an idiot. I do not care what the news says, the news are full of politically focused idiots, JUST like this subreddit. I don't know or care where you are, but my country has no vaccine passports, the US has no vaccine passports, neither does any country with medical privacy rights, because it's a violation of your right to privacy. I would appose it anywhere it was attempted. And you do make shit up, all the time. Y'all just say shit like how mRNA vaccines aren't really vaccines, despite that being an utterly bizarre lie.</p>

<p>That is when you re sick. I'm not sick. So why do I have to wear a mask. It also prevents me from breathing, as masks prevent airflow. Masks aren't meant to be worn, when you walk for example. Surgeons don't do physical efforts when they wear masks.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I do not care what the news says</p>
<p>So why do you believe we re in a pandemic then? It's only on teevee you see it. Outside, beside the mad rules, metal freakouts, hysteria, job loses, economical genocide, inflation, fines and jailing for visiting your family etc, everything is normal. The sun rises, ppl are still there, i don't see deaths drop on the ground like they showed us in wuhan ... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;because it's a violation of your right to privacy.</p>
<p>Here in europe, you have to get a vaccine passport, or a pcr test. Nothing is private, you have to prove if you are infected, not infected, vaccinated or not :D </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And you do make shit up, all the time.</p>
<p>Just like you, that doesn't watch the tv, but seems to talk the same shit they talk on the tv ... :D</p>

        <p>&rt;I know people who've died of covid so</p>
<p>You re very unlucky to know very weak/old/obese ppl, or you re lying :) I don't know a single person that died from covid. All those that had it, mostly knew about it because of a test. They were asymptomatic. The few that weren't, only lost a bit their smell for a week. That's it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I know dozens who've had it and gotten fucked up for months on end.</p>
<p>Same reply as previous, you must be very unlucky to know many very weak/old.obese ppl, or you re lying :)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;You shouldn't need a vaccine passport, that's bad.</p>
<p>It's only a beginning. This is one of the reasons, this sub exists ... think again. If vaccines weren't passively mandatory, and if the "pandemic rules" weren't as stupid, NNN woudln't exist.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I can exercise in a mask,</p>
<p>I don't :) Everyone is different. I can run 10km and benchpress 150 pounds. Can you?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I'm also not sick, the masks worked for me so like, whatever.</p>
<p>It didn't work, as you didn't need it. Masks are made for surgeons, and can eventually limit droplet propagation, in case you re sick. If you re not sick, it is literally of no use.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Also define economical genocide. Cause I guarantee you that no nation wants they're fucking economy to collapse.</p>
<p>Are you seriously, asking this? Do you know how many millions upon million of little shops, restaurants, pubs, all over the world went totally bakrupt? Nation? Nations have nothing to say. Google, microsoft, amazon, wallmart, those have all to say. And they won a SHIT TON during last year, and this year :) This is an economical genocide, happening just in front of your eyes. Are you blind?<br>
Do you work? Or are you still a student? I guess you don't own your own business right?</p>

        <p>A) it's not smart to diminish the term genocide when you actually mean the failings of Capitalism. I agree that it's terrible that so many small businesses collapsed only for the richest of the rich to horde even more wealth that they will never use though. </p>
<p>I'm not lying about the sick and dead I've known, we were hit very hard here. </p>
<p>I don't run 10kms but I do love to take a lovely hike when I can, I was born with fucked up knees so I can't run well without falling flat on my face lol. </p>
<p>If I was sick I was asymptomatic, but I never actually got tested, I wore my mask just in case and had no issue with it. That's why I dislike the rhetoric about how masks are a violation of freedoms, it's technically correct the same way speed limits would be. It's an issue of public safety and barely an inconvenience in my view.</p>
<p>All in all I disagree with most of the rhetoric on this sub because it plainly goes against my experience of this pandemic, and while I understand that many people have had vastly different experiences, I can only work off of mine.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;If I was sick I was asymptomatic</p>
<p>No, when you are sick, means you have symptoms. If you have no symptoms, means you aren't sick.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I wore my mask just in case and had no issue with it.</p>
<p>But you do have an issue with running, right? ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;it's technically correct the same way speed limits would be.</p>
<p>Not speed limit, but wearing a belt. A belt, shouldn't be mandatory. If i want to die in a crash, it's my problem, right? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; It's an issue of public safety and barely an inconvenience in my view.</p>
<p>Public safety of what? An illness that kills 0,025% ppl a year, that are fat, old or sick? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;All in all I disagree with most of the rhetoric on this sub because it plainly goes against my experience of this pandemic</p>
<p>Your experience of the pandemic, seems to be on the lying or unlucky side. The great majority of ppl on this planet, don't know  single person that has died, or was very sick from covid. Just like the majority of ppl, don't know someone that died decapitated ... Those are rare occurrences .. certainly dramatic for the ppl concerned, but not a public safety problem. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I can only work off of mine.</p>
<p>Good, now, try to not promote the vaccine, the covid pass, etc. And ppl like me, won't have a problem with ppl like you. Vaccines, masks and lockdowns, should be done by choice, not by law or force ... If you fear, put a masks on, lock yourself up, and let other ppl live.</p>

        <p>If you think that being consistent through time and not changing your opinion when presented with new information is a good thing when it comes to science, then I assume you also think that the sun orbits our flat earth? Seeing as those are the oldest theories, and consistency is all that matters, those must be the correct conclusions.</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm gonna go with less. Obviously a virulent organism contains genetic material. But it's an actual organism, whole or partial, that triggers production of antibodies. The mRNA shot uses artificially created RNA to trigger a cell's production of the spike protein. They work quite differently.</p>

        <p>You can say that if you want, but it doesn't change the fact that it's an entirely new type of injection (in development for many years but never put into practice) that either isn't a vaccine or stretches the definition of vaccine to include it.</p>

        <p>True intent, sure, if the true intent is simply "an injection that helps protect you from a disease," but as we can see, the definition of vaccine used to be a bit more specific than that. But it now must be modified and stretched to make mRNA therapy fit.</p>
