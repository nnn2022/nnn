        <p>The ruling was that neither vaccinations nor nonmedical masks are highly guaranteed/effective against viruses:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Experts testified that it was illogical to force healthy nurses to wear masks, and Hayes concluded the masks were not protecting patients or nurses from the flu**."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What I will say is that based on actual scientific studies, the claim I quoted from the article is correct.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'll add that **the typical nonmedical face mask** (which the typical nurse etc wears, *and especially the typical nonmedical person*) has on their boxes "This product is non-medical device" (yes, they used incorrect grammar but they are made in China, though at least they spell correctly unlike like most North Americans, lol)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and **are sealed with the following stickers:**  </p>
<p>"THIS PRODUCT IS FOR NON-MEDICAL USE ONLY. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A RESPIRATOR AND WILL **NOT** PROVIDE **ANY** PROTECTION AGAINST COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS) OR ANY OTHER VIRUS OR CONTAMINANTS."</p>
