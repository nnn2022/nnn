    <strong>I just understood that most people don't even know about the building 7 in 9/11</strong>
    <p><p>So couple of days ago I was talking with my boss at work about the COVID-19 vaccine. He at some point asked me did I take it, to which I answered <em>No,</em> to which he replied that "<em>So you are one of those conspiracy theorists - vaccines makes the 5G kill you, right?"</em> Well this led to a long conversation on which I went over my reasons for not taking it, but at the end when I tried to make my point about how the media has lied to us before, by asking that <em>"What about the building 7 in 9/11 then?"</em> he answered that he didn't know what I was talking about. I was just like "<em>What? Two planes hit down 3 buildings and the third building wasn't even touched but still came down. You believe that?"</em> To which he just said again that he doesn't know anything about the 9/11 and the conversation pretty much ended there. </p>
<p>This made me realize how clueless and ignorant most people are. Kind of depressing.</p></p>

        <p>I tell people- especially bosses that I identify as vaccinated </p>
<p>Because of science right? If I genuinely believe I’m vaccinated I can be that right? You can’t discriminate for what I believe I am</p>
