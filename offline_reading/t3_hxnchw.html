        <p>When you need critical care, if your blood pressure gets low enough theres a drug called levophed that shunts the blood to your organs and away from the extremities, sometimes leading to lost fingers and toes, and even limbs. So that couldve been it. </p>
<p>Ive also heard people cite higher risk for blood clots from the virus. But i have been wondering how much this is people in hospitals not getting great care and if people not in hospitals are also having these issues when they get sick.</p>
<p>Edit: just read the full thing. The physician cites blood clots from the virus. 
From the patient: he had "...MRSA, 
..sepsis,  ...kidney failure, ...liver failure, pulmonary embolisms, burst lungs..."</p>
<p>So lots of opportunities for messed up blood pressure if thats what the direct cause was.</p>

        <p>Ventilators lead to blood clots since the patients sedated and can’t move. The nurses are supposed to turn them throughout the day, but obviously this is not happening. In a lot of places the nurses aren’t even going into the patient rooms because “they might get sick.” </p>

        <p>I dont see how being on a ventilator on its own would do that. It could be an indirect actor on the causative issue I suppose. There would have to be some other main problem, such as the blood pressure thing or blood clots. </p>
<p>One consideration could be that since you have to be sedated to be intubated, if you dont have physical therapy/passive PT while you are sedated, the blood pooling/being stagnant dramaticslly increases likelihood of getting blood clots especially in the legs. If no one ever starts some kind of blood clot prophylaxis on you in the hospital (which Id think would be really unusual but idk these days, I stopped working in a hospital last summer) then I could see it slipping through the cracks somehow.</p>

        <p>Another thing I thought of is that blood clots for "no known reason" except the virus may be overreported because of embarrassment by staff or lying in the record about blood clot prophylaxis being done when it wasnt (I saw this even pre-covid). Theres not a lot of incentive to root this out in hospitals when they can blame something else because if a blood clot is linked to negligence by the medical team, the hospital has to pay for the treatment (or lawsuit if the person loses a limb or something). So its to their benefit for it to turn out to be true about covid as a disease increasing blood clot risk. It lets them not take responsibility for poor patient outcomes. Really sucky for patients.</p>

        <p>&rt;He ticked off a long list of complications he suffered as a consequence of the respiratory illness: “from MRSA, to sepsis, to kidney failure, to liver failure, pulmonary embolisms, burst lungs — four of them.”</p>
<p>That dude lost his fingers due to the MRSA infection.  This is something that happens sometimes and it's usually due to hospital-acquired infections.  There was a case of a woman a few years back who was shot during a robbery and, due to a MRSA infection she contracted in the hospital, ended up losing both arms and both legs.
