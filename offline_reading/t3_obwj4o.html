    <strong>Why is it "99.99% safe" with COVID but a "big risk" with vaccines when both have such a miniscule risk chance?</strong>
    <p><p>Thought I'd ask an active community in hopes of getting some real responses, people tend to just get angry when you point this out. </p>
<p>I get the idea people aren't scared of COVID because of the low deaths, sure, you do you, but isn't it a bit hypocritical to then simultaneously panic and overreact to the 0.001% chance of vaccine side effects? Is that not the same as "falling for media fear mongering", but instead you're just falling for someone trying to scare you on Facebook? </p>
<p>Surely near-100% safety chance is either a trivial risk factor or not, can't have it both ways?</p></p>
