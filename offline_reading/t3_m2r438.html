        <p>You know, when the hippies were protesting the war in Vietnam, a lot of the same speech suppression tactics were used; they are "dangerous", they are spreading "fake news", they are "extremists".</p>
<p>Trying to get a subreddit taken down because you dont like what they are saying generally says more about you than about your target. And what happens when the main corporate narrative suddenly says something you disagree with? Should you be silenced as well?</p>

        <p>That's why there's such a thing as fact checking, the problem is you make people scared of facts and gravitate more towards feelings than anything. That's what is dangerous. And also, that last point, won't happen because I hate the government. If anything goes past my constitutional rights, I will bear arms with my brothers and sisters, but WEARING A MASK IS NOT UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT'S COMMON SENSE.</p>

<p>99% of the users here are not anti-vaxx, just this very rushed, untested vaxx. 99% of the users here know the CCP virus is real, although overblown. We're against the useless, ever changing guidelines and extremely harmful overreach because insecure, insignificant people like yourself think they're morally superior for suddenly being pro-life/pro-boomer.</p>

        <p>1: all vaccines have been fully tested, and only a few rare people actually got hurt by them, and they work.
2: you're not hurting my feelings, you're making my brain hurt.
3: I think I am superior to you, yes, because i care about my fellow citizens IN THE CORRECT WAY /yes there is a correct way).
4: it isn't overblown. If it hadn't just killed half a million people, I would've agreed. You only think it's overblown because we haven't had a pandemic in a long time, thanks to people like me that actually matter (because I'm just a voice) and vaccines.
5: we are absolutely morally superior to you.
6: fuck boomers. where did we say that? Lol we just want everyone to be safe and alive.</p>

        <p>My, what an insufferable, arrogant twit you are. Pretending to be moral and actually having morals are not the same thing. What do you do to actually help your fellow man besides posturing on the internet? Do you volunteer in your community? Donate food to shelters? Are you a first responder? A non-dancing nurse? Mentor at risk kids? You wear a face diaper and advocate for an untested medical treatment. How moral. Gfy, authoritarian trash.</p>

        <p>Ah, so you're OK with blatantly lying, not voicing opinions as you say. You do know the very app you are spreading this wildfire upon is probably going to find this place and get rid of it whether or not I said anything? Like, y'all don't even research. You just say what's on your mind, which is almost always wrong. So you know what, fine I'll shut up, while I watch you all die from a virus that literally would have gone away sooner if everyone would've just listened and done as they were told.</p>

        <p>You can disagree with people here by providing facts if a discussion is what you want. I don't know what benefit you were trying to get out of stereotyping everyone in this subreddit. There is misinformation everywhere. There are a lot reasons the virus spread. Blaming everyone online in a forum for a virus spreading is unproductive. These people are not the root of the issue. I'm willing to have a conversation, but you've already stereotyped everyone here and then wished death upon them. So like, what exactly is your intention? Do you have a question or something that might help you gain insight on other people's perspectives?</p>
