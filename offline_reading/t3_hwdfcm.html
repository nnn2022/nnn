    <strong>Institutionalised Psychological Warfare Under the New Normal</strong>
    <p><p>Perhaps the psychological reality of what is actually happening through this whole coronavirus situation, is that for their protection, populations across the industrialised world are being conditioned, trained, to accept being abused by authority, and to further abuse members who will not accept the original abuses.</p>
<p>In particular,  note how none of the more extreme measures claimed to help halt the spread of the virus are actually backed by particularly strong scientific evidence. </p>
<p>The onslaught of increasingly ridiculous measures and equally ridiculous propaganda represents therefore, an attack on the public's sense of proportionality in government's response to threats, facilitating public consent for more egregious and invasive abuses in the near future, and ushering in a new age of modern authoritianism by stealth, ostensibly for the sake public health. In particular, immunity passports, and mandatory vaccination in some form are being prepped, and propaganda is being deployed to characterise those who would not have a vaccine as dangerous. Crippling over time the public's ability to sense and resist government overreach in their lives, is the very best method for maintaining and securing any fascistic system. Over the generations, the very notion of overreach could be eliminated, as total state control over every facet of public and private life becomes as present, and as natural as the very air they breathe. </p>
<p>Conscience aside, I admire those who have orchestrated this psychological operation. We are witnessing the very pinnacle of social engineering. Continuing this thought, where can I submit an application to be a psy-op architect in exchange for a degree of exemption from the new normal? </p>
<p>If I am right and this process is successful, then attempts are being made to render the very people who are supposed to stop this, incapable of knowing what is happening as they are gradually being broken down psychologically through a perpetual carrot-and-stick strategy, except that the carrot(freedom) is getting smaller over time, and the stick(this or any other disease) can be declared to arbitrarily severe through statistical tomfoolery and propaganda.</p></p>

        <p>This is a wonderful, yet terrifying post, and I think you've hit so many things on the head. People are malleable and ready, we have the inciting incident, and the momentum can only grow and snowball out of control as people double down on their sense of moral superiority to justify worse and worse actions, and still call themselves good. It's a regression of the human state.</p>
<p>One thing I'll pull you on is that if you wanna go psy-op then you'd have to be like O'Brien in 1984 and convince yourself of the merit of the 'New Normal' more than anyone else, not less. Remember, it's these people who are executed when their mission is done because they know too much.</p>
<p>What scares me is that if some mothers are able to forego seeing their own children for the past 4 months, then there's maybe very little we as peers can do to change minds. They've managed to break people down into their base authoritarian personalities with an ease that Goebbels and Goering would be in awe of.</p>

        <p>I know it seems like there is some orchestration but I'm going to call Occam's Razor on this and assume there is some subliminal motivations that drive this that touch on what you mentioned.  The outcome will be the same regardless.</p>
