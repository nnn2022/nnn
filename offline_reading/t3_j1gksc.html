        <p>All I know is, right now, I feel a lot of anger, hatred, and resentment towards people. This was something I felt before the "pandemic", and I was working toward healing from the pain, but the "pandemic" has plunged me back into those feelings, tenfold. My life feels ruined, and continues to steadily get worse. Not sure what to do anymore.</p>

        <p>So I wanted to dedicate my life to traveling (one of the huge reasons I didn't have kids) and if this is what life is gonna be and I can't even go to countries without the covid19 test which I refuse to take then what's the point in living. I'm just working to sit home on the weekends and do nothing. Might as well off myself.</p>

<p>Tune into this feeling, but not in a way that drains you of hope.  Instead, study the meaning, ask yourself why.  Why is this being forced upon us?  I don't want to bias anybody with (my) answers, but staring at this question long enough will lead you places.</p>

        <p>Same. Childless as well, with one of my main incentives being wanting to travel as much as possible. I feel like I’m rotting, I try to keep my mind and body active but without things like traveling, concerts, spontaneous nights out, everything feels so empty. I’ve never been a homebody, but now when I go out it’s weird so no place feels enjoyable anymore.</p>

        <p>Honestly I am amazed that the democrats do this because there are few things more destructive than this.</p>
<p>Trump is a malicious man but the democrats have managed to offend me more with the covid hysteria peddling than trump has ever come close to in 4 years of presidency.</p>
<p>I am european and a liberal. I am actually more left wing than the democrats but I would still vote for trump if I was american.</p>
<p>Trump is mainly interested in himself and not interested in locking me up and muzzling me "for my own good".</p>

        <p>I was liberal and actually voted for Bernie Sanders last election. It was once the $ myself and many others donated to him was given to Hillary Clinton’s campaign once Bernie dropped out (Clinton was/is the epitome of everything he was speaking out against), that i realized we have been duped. I started hearing trump out and believing that America is actually a great country with possibly more opportunity than anywhere in the world. His rhetoric and ideology helped me become the patriotic person i am today. He’s given more to our military than all of Obama’s years combined, he’s far more pro capitalism, and taught me that if you don’t do everything you can to legally evade taxes, you’re stupid. Taxation is theft and it’s one of the biggest reasons our country was founded. Believe it or not, contrary to popular belief that slavery was the only reason for the Civil War, tariffs were also one of the biggest reasons that took place as well. </p>

        <p>I think Trump supporters are generally more anti mask but I don’t see Trump doing anything to stop mandatory masks. Whether he has the power to do so or not is debatable but I don’t see him taking a hard stance on the issue. I don’t see why people seem to think these mask mandates are going to suddenly go away if he’s re-elected.</p>

        <p>I think Big Pharma has more power than Trump and it’s a topic he’s afraid to touch. Big pharma has lobbied politicians the most out of every industry for over 22 consecutive years. So ya, unfortunately, there are just some things a president can’t change. We The People need to step up to the plate on this one and challenge this madness on every possible occasion</p>

        <p>This is a good point. He can’t get in the way of the vaccine. There’s a lot of money to be made. Although now Fauci is saying we might still need masks after the vaccine- I don’t know maybe this is just a way to pressure everyone into getting it. I’m anti mandatory masks and I’m not seeing much pushback at all in the US. So many people have bought into the lies and propaganda. I don’t want to live in a world where my children are forced to grow up wearing masks.</p>

        <p>The way Covid-19 has been politicized is all about forced vaccines. The masks are a way to not only make us less reluctant to take the vaccine, but a way to divide us. It was actually during Reagan administration that legislation was passed to remove any/all liability for pharmaceutical companies creating vaccines - many would argue trump has been Reagan 2.0...for fuck’s sake, it’s where he got his “MAGA” slogan from...</p>

        <p>Yes. I feel like everything I’ve worked for doesn’t matter anymore. I feel <em>less</em> depressed than I did a few months ago but... what’s the point of logging on everyday to do work if I don’t have anything to spend my money on? What’s the point in saving up money to buy property when I don’t think I want a small condo anymore (I’m beginning to see the appeal in buying a house), or if I don’t even know if I want to stay in NY? What’s the point in staying in NY if going to the office isn’t a thing, I can’t see any of my friends, and my one family member around here (my brother) doesn’t want to see me without stupid social distancing requirements?</p>

        <p>Set goals and hunt them like you depend on them to breath. Think about what you’re sayin though, u have the internet. U probably live in a Country still better than the vast majority of people in the world. Did u know that if u make over 30k in the US, ur in the top 1% of the world. Be grateful but not submissive to those who threaten these opportunities. Also, turn off the tv, get off reddit, stop playing video games and hunt goals. Write shit down and start lifting (more if u already do). Sacrifice and hard work pay off</p>

        <p>well i havent saw any countries yet that went total isolation apart from the extreme infected ones (there might be and im stupid), so the increase in suicide cant be that big. i dont think total isolation will become a normal between countries if the covid wont infect more than 50 percent of the world civilisation</p>

        <p>Alright. How stupid are you guys. How do you believe that wearing masks are bad and that this pandemic is a scam the government has been working on for years? How? This is rivaling stupidity of medivial times. ThE mAsK wOnT lEt Me BrEaTe. I bet that you could wear a mask that fully encases you mouth and head for 4 hours on a halloween and not care, but god forbid that the world wants to fucking live, and you cant wear your mask outside for 20 minutes. 20 MINUTES. What do you fucking want from the world. Your not some fucking princess who gets whatever you fucking want, and this isnt a fucking game. This global pandemic could basically wipe out humanity, but i guess you're too fucking prissy to wear a fucking mask for two seconds to go buy something, and you want humanity to be wiped out? America is the land of freedom but there won't be a goddamn America cause the economy will collapse because theres a virus on the loose, because you motherfucking people are so fucking paranoid about losing your freedom which will never happen. Also, how do you think this is a joke? I bet if you got transported to the time of the black death you wouldn't fucking think this is a joke. "Oh, but so little people have died, its probably nothing." NO!!!! You know why its nothing? Because ever other county except America is fucking smart. You, you shit-for-brains IMBICILES think your google lookups and conspircy theorys are worth more than research done by people who actually know shit about this? Fuck America and fuck all of you piece of shits.</p>
