        <p>Creepy stuff for sure.  </p>
<p>I haven't really read into the GR, I can't understand why they would want to reduce the population that significantly. </p>
<p>Using this clip and reading into popular discourse around the topic, I'll try to sum up my perceptions. </p>
<p>This clip implies that the guy is concerned about the health of the planet. However, at his age, he will die before the world truly falls apart. In this scenario, his plan is to reduce the population through infertility and selective breeding. This will take 80-90 years considering the youngest ages alive and a long lifespan. Following this plot line: he will die before the plan plays out - thereby proving that the world will not end within (at least) the next 30 years due to climate change or anything else. </p>
<p>So, he was telling lies when he made it seem like the planet would fall apart if they don't do something immediately. </p>
<p>With that in mind, its likely that we can draw a similar conclusion about the planet from the clip. We aren't in danger of reducing the earth to deserts or completely ruining all palatable land within the next generation.</p>
<p>So the question still stands, why reduce the population that drastically?</p>
<p>If it's not about the health of the planet, what is it about?</p>
<p>Control seems like the next obvious plan, to reduce the population so that the survivors can be more tightly controlled.</p>
<p>I'm under the impression now that we're already pretty well regulated and what the average person sees is for the most part pretty sanitized and thoroughly propagandized. So what more can they gain? Perhaps they are hoping to really tighten things up, really 1984 in here. </p>
<p>That begs the question though, to what end?</p>
<p>Is this life just a game of the most powerful? Like we're talking about a plan that will take multiple generations to implement. Why change things so drastically if what they have is already working so well. Look at the numbers for people getting vaccinated, it's a lot LOT of people. A lot of people are buying into this whole nonsense - or at least it seems. If that's the case, then we're already bought hook line and sinker. What's the point of the GR?</p>

        <p>Based on my own independent reaserch into this fringe subject matter, I've concluded that there does indeed seem to be a sinister agenda at hand in regards to this vaccine; although the evidence is mostly anecdotal/circumstantial..If we analyze the potential growth for the human population on statistical chart graphs, It would appear to be in the realm of (unsustainability) Both on a Financial/ecological bases; would mass sterilization be the ultimate antidote in solving this "problem" I don't know.... Thank you for your indepth response</p>

        <p>The human birth rates are already lower than ever, to the point where there are people trying to increase the birth rates. I dont think we are unsustainable at all. Our practices are definitely unsustainable, but our population is surely not. Perhaps it's becoming difficult to keep everyone working, you can only make up so many bullshit jobs.</p>

        <p>When the vaccine coercion started, alongside all the authoritarian lockdown measures, my initial guess was it was going to produce acute death and chronic sterility. Its the easiest solution and something that the rich and powerful would deem necessary and acceptable. We must hold them accountable.</p>

<p>It's not inherently a bad idea (population control), though using genocide to get there is deplorable.</p>
<p>Honestly just taking warning labels off and letting people do what they're gonna do is population control enough so idk why we have so many rules and regulations if they're hell bent on killing us all.</p>

        <p>Yep. There are a lot of books on learning to take care of yourself. Unfortunately the for profit medical industry has made community health a commodity for so long generations have forgotten how to do basic care. You should be able to suture. You should know how to make basic medicines from herbs. I know how to do both. </p>
<p>This isn't ideal, this is just speculating on a better idea than mass genocide for population control. Going back to basics is the best way to handle it. People survived for.centuries before modernism, I think with the knowledge we have learned, if it is dispensed appropriately we can go back to a healthier form of feudalism.</p>
