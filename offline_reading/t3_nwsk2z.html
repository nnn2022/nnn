        <p>Isn't this racist?  I mean the democrats and the MSM tell us that minorities are too dumb to find the DMV, use the internet, and can't make it to polling places.  How the fuck are they supposed to find and make it to vaccination sites.  These businesses hate minorities!!!!!</p>

        <p>I think the point being made is that leftists have argued that requiring IDs for voting is racist because they believe that African Americans have difficulties acquiring one for some reason, but with that same logic, leftists would also have to agree that requiring proof of vaccination is also racist because it may be just as, if not more, difficult to acquire than an ID.</p>

        <p>The point is the political Left has no problem otherizing people based on arbitrary reasons. A few lefties I spoke to about masks said "I don't understand why wearing masks is a political statement." These are the same people who will still wear masks after being vaccinated so people don't think they're Republicans. None of this behavior is based on science. This a huge Political fever dream.</p>

        <p>I'm still wearing a mask even after being vaccinated because currently we are at a 40% vaccination rate and hopefully by wearing a mask it reinforces the idea that those who aren't vaccinated should wear masks. There's a whole lot of lying about being vaccinated right now.</p>

        <p>I’m going to assume what you say about yourself is true. That being the case I’m also going to assume you understand that the PCR test is crap for what they are using it for and there is no such thing as asymptotic spread of a virus. It’s either alive in your cells replicating (aka your sick) or it’s dead (your not sick.) You should also know that this is not a vaccine. It’s not even a prophylactic, it’s gene therapy. Gene therapy has had an absolutely garbage track record of being effective or safe for that matter. The manufacturers of these jabs haven’t run a single animal trial for these because they knew exactly what happened to every single animal (cats and ferrets) they gave it to during the trials for the swine flu shot and SARS shots they were working on during those “outbreaks.” They all ended up dead. To be honest I don’t believe that they (whoever is really in charge) are looking to “infect everyone with a worm” or exterminate us all quickly with these. It’s all a money making scheme, always has been, always will be. This time around they got sloppy. They rushed things, they didn’t have their ducks in a row and shit hit the fan. People are getting hurt from this “vaccine.” Especially those within the 18-29 range. If they have their way we will have Covid 20, 21, 22, this variant, that variant and new jabs every time. People will continue to take them, they will get sick, they will die. Especially when exposed to an actual wild virus. Like you said the mortality rate was amongst those what were likely going to die within the next year or so anyway and the rest of this country is sick, fat, smokes, drinks and eats garbage 24/7. If 95% of the people who “got Covid” went in the sun, exercised, ate right and supplemented vitamins/minerals they wouldn’t have even gotten sick. Yet because of everything the Rockefellers have done to the education and medical fields they run to the pills and shots. The medical system in the west is fucked and it’s all for a profit most are just over educated on the what makes the system work or not educated at all.</p>

        <p>Gene therapy would imply integrating into the genome. That isn't the case here. RNA viruses exist and have vaccines.</p>
<p>The PCR test is crap because they are using CT values of 42-44. I definitely agree with you on that. Our lab took anything above a CT of 28 to means that it was nothing.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic carriers are widespread and have absolutely existed. Typhoid Mary is one to start. Why some people experience more symptoms while others don't is still up for question. Some may have symptoms less pronounced. I got covid and then had a more difficult time with cardio, but that was really my only symptom.</p>
<p>Is it a money making scheme? Oh hell yes. Is it going to kill you, no it won't. Is it effective? Absolutely. There's so much litigation and paperwork behind everything drug related, even in emergency applications, that you're pretty safe with it. The fly by night medical trials of the 50's are gone.</p>
<p>Now for animal test.... Usually animals would be first line test. However you need models to do this. Prostate cancer models, heart failure models, etc. Since all of this had to be done so quickly (because pandemic you know) there wasn't sufficient time to ensure that animal models had the same reaction as humans. Even at that, there are many differences in the way an animal will process something compared to a human (between all species). Cars have different parasites and viruses than you do.</p>

        <p>Depending on which shot you got that is exactly what they did to make it. A vaccine by definition is “A preparation of a weakened or killed pathogen, such as a bacterium or virus, or of a portion of the pathogen's structure that upon administration to an individual stimulates antibody production or cellular immunity against the pathogen but is incapable of causing severe infection.” This is not a vaccine. This is a mRna drug, not a Rna drug. It is gene therapy. They cannot and have not proven its effectiveness nor its safety. They completely changed the definition of a pandemic during an emergency meeting....there was no actual pandemic they created one. This meeting was comprised of “top medical officials” hand selected by big pharma. I feel you seriously underestimate the lack of fucks these people have for trials, and litigation. Unfortunately for them By the end of June there will be multiple international lawsuits filed against said pharmaceutical companies and their accomplices for their mass disinformation campaign, death and destruction brought on by their plandemic, suppression of viable cures/treatments and economic disaster. The information is going to get out and people are going to be pissed. They put out fake studies to smear things like ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, zinc, vitamin c and d. Which in turn gave them their emergency authorization as well as COMPLETE immunity from any mishaps related to the jabs. VAERS and the yellow card do not lie... it may not kill or harm everyone but more will be hurt by these “drugs” than the virus. You are convinced other wise and that is fine, you’re not gonna change my mind either.</p>

        <p>Pretty sure it has a lot to do with the way you see this “pandemic.” You wear a mask while being vaccinated..... you actually care how many people take this poison. I think it has a lot to do with the media. If you actually looked at the statistics from the cdc and understand the severity of this “new virus” you wouldn’t have the same point of view.</p>

        <p>I'm literally in the medical field and helped develop other vaccines. Now I assume you think that makes me part of the system. That aside, if they really wanted to infect the population with some kind worm, there are plenty of more efficient ways to do so. The mortality in the 75+ age group was 80%. You're not taking the vaccine to prevent a minor cough in a 20 year old. Also, 67% of the US is obese, another chunk vapes and smokes, both very strong predisposing factors to making you get much more Ill if sick. The actual amount of people who have died is not that great compared to who has had it, but a ton of those who have had the virus have after effects that last.</p>

        <p>It’s got nothing to do with politics to claim you’re a virgin 
While all you can do is talk and insult a group that doesn’t care Lmao I’ll take room 206
Learn to manage your anger it’ll help later on
I recommend you learn critical thinking 
If all you can do is call people names go back to pre k</p>

Also yes, covid has a low death rate. But thats because  not everyone has been getting infected by it. If we never did anything to slow the spread a LOT more people would have died due to the hospitals getting full. Doctors would have run out of beds and ventilators and they would have had to pick who to treat if we didn't slow the spread.</p>

        <p>Yes, fuck them. They lived longer than any other generation before them, they have 10+ grandkids, they owned property, they were alive during the best decades and enjoyed the most freedom. None of us will ever get this. I'm not saying they should die, I'm saying we shouldn't sacrifice young people for their comfort and that's not gonna achieve much anyway because these people are already old and frail.</p>

        <p>I’d argue (any sane person would) that that losing a parent is far worse than a temporary economic decline if we are talking about the impact to young people now. People go from rags to riches and back many times in the USA throughout their lives; death is permanent though. But, I’m sure the study I posted is ‘fake’, right? Bottom line is that covid sucks and the USA figured out a way to divide itself during the crisis. Covid highlights gaps in our healthcare system as well as our education system. </p>

        <p>It's a choice to get the vaccine ad opposed to just being born black.  It's a false anecdotal and a poor connection.  Relating bot getting a vaccine to being born colored is a stretch</p>

<p>And you are totally wrong. 2020 was the highest death rate since 1943 which, if you recall from history class, was the middle of world war II. 572,000 more Americans died in 2020 than in 2019. You keep spreading your bullshit though.</p>

        <p>I never had to live in a bubble this whole time. I’ve been out enjoying my life. Glad you could get access to the vaccine if you wanted it though. </p>
<p>And this line is important:
 &rt; However, the recent population estimate does not incorporate the results of the 2020 Census</p>
<p>It’s all based on estimates right now. And given that only 350,000 people died of COVID in 2020, it’s clear that for 1.04% of people to have died it was due to more than just COVID. Perhaps adverse effects of lockdowns</p>

        <p>They died from many things. Just not all of them died to COVID. You’re so close to figuring out that people naturally die! Let me know when you find the cure to death though, it seems that’s what you’re waiting for before you can go outside</p>

        <p>This is the argument. This is it. Pay attention.</p>
<p>You call it rational and I call it selfish. All you had to do was the simplest fucking thing. Stay home for a little while and wear a mask when you went out. Very simple. Very easy and could quite possibly save someone's life. You never know what people are dealing with. The guy in line next to you at the store might have type 2 diabetes and you might be walking around with covid and inadvertently kill the guy.</p>
<p>It was about decency. It was about caring about your fellow man to the point that you would make a small sacrifice to make sure you didn't endanger someone else. That is being rational. I wasn't living in fear. That disease wasn't going to kill me in all likelihood. I knew that and I wasn't worried about it. I just didn't want to inadvertently kill someone else. I care about other people...</p>
<p>And that's the difference. You don't.</p>
<p>You were more concerned about some perceived infringement of your freedom. But I don't see you bitching when you got to put your seatbelt on or when you have to drive the speed limit. Still pay taxes without a fuss. I bet you show up to work on time. I bet you don't wear assless chaps to the grocery store. How is the mask any different? It wasn't as though you didn't have a choice. If you didn't want to wear it, order your groceries to be delivered. </p>
<p>Those of us who followed the recommendations and wore our mask and kept socially distanced and now have been vaccinated are really fucking sick of you self-righteous assholes that made this thing drag out so long because you couldn't be bothered to do the simplest goddamn thing.</p>

        <p>Maybe they should have stayed home instead of whining that everyone else doesn’t stay home. If you’re worried about a virus you can stay home and not get it.

        <p>&rt;You’re so close to figuring out that people naturally die!</p>
<p>Yet, statistically speaking, the number of people who died year over year is predictable. This was a statistically significant difference that you're ignoring.</p>

        <p>No. Clearly COVID was going to kill slightly more than average. It killed about 0.1% of Americans in a year, that’s not something that required shutting the entire world down and putting everything on hold</p>

        <p>It wouldn’t have been much worse. The virus spread everywhere in the US. It’s not like there was a place that was unaffected by the virus. No one deserved to have their business shutdown or their lives put on hold because an extra 0.1% of Americans died to a virus</p>

        <p>Disagree. Slowing down the spread was the entire goal, less preventing millions from catching it, so as not to overwhelm the medical system. It did that (to the best of its ability, what with people not caring about others), and caused less death.</p>

        <p>Most people have been exposed to COVID by now. The people that were this worried would have been staying inside no matter what the restrictions were. The people that weren’t worried aren’t following the restrictions. It would have been about the same, but we couldn’t have caused trillions of dollars of economic problems and job loss to go along with it</p>

        <p>This is false. Race is something you're born with, vaccination is something you choose. So far, has it seriously effected your education, or your job? Unlikely, of it has, you're likely in a situation where vaccination is required. Don't be brain-dead, no one is trying to pUt yOu In cAmPs, we all just want this to be over, and vaccination seems to be the quickest route right now.</p>

<p>You CANNOT coerce the general public into taking an experiential vaccine.
You dipshit, it has accepted adulation across the country through forced digital education for children, stripping then of socialization, and force masking them when they pose no threat or are barely threatened by the disease.
You think this will all be over by surrendering your personal freedoms to the governemtn dmso they'll give them back to you? You people should be thrown into a volcano, your complicit fuckery on nearly every political topic is driving this country to death.</p>

        <p>What personal freedoms? I agree that it's right to be wary about vaccination, but from those that I know who've taken it, the worst side effect was that they felt Ill for a week.</p>
<p>Masking children was non-mandatory in most places, and a precaution to avoid spread. You people reallyl LP 0 don't0 understand caring for a community do you? Honestly, I'd expect nothing less from conservatives that liken vaccinations to Jewish concentration camps.</p>
<p>And what do you mean by 'complicit fuckery?' Better to not do anything than fuck over lockdowns like most countries did, or start up global warming.</p>

<p>Except we still need to stem rising variants. We're only reopening because many people have the vaccination, but if a large population remains unvaccinated, more variants will arise and we'll be back to the start.</p>

<p>The likelihood of this is basically nil.</p>
<p>&rt; Except we still need to stem rising variants.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence that they're actually a problem?</p>
<p>&rt; but if a large population remains unvaccinated, more variants will arise and we'll be back to the start.</p>
<p>That's not how any of this works.  They're moving the goalposts on you and you're not even noticing it.  The variants are highly likely to be less deadly,  so there's no reason to expect we'd have to "go back to the start."</p>
<p>It's all frog-boiling.</p>

<p>On what basis? We've already seen strains that have higher rates of infection.</p>

<p>No, you are. The more people who're vaccinated, the less likely that scenario is.</p>

        <p>Cool. I do know a lot of very healthy people who died although. I actually know 2 who died en 4 who still has serious problems. Having a good health doesn’t mean Covid has no effect or something, and being unhealthy doesn’t mean you’re going to die for sure. It does increase the chances although.</p>

        <p>&rt;segregation when it is based on assumptions that someone is sick</p>
<p>That assumption is pretty natural to make at this point considering how contagious Covid is, that it spread across the entire world</p>
<p>&rt;People that get corona develop immunity to it so why should they be segregated</p>
<p>Yes, <em>medically</em> they're safe. But practically, how do you expect that to work. Instead of checking hospital records and immunity tests to show that you've had Covid at some point and then beaten it, it's much more efficient to simony check vaccination statuses</p>

        <p>Okay, let me put it this way. It's the law to wear your seatbelt. Even if your car physically can't go above 10 mph, the same law applies. Yes in theory it's 'unfair' because the occupants of such a car aren't in any danger, but the law still applies to them nonetheless and they'll be stopped by cops in public.</p>

        <p>You said: People that get corona develop immunity to it so why should they be segregated</p>
<p>Answer: Because the immunity you gain from suffering through the virus you caught, may or may not help you get through a variation. Variations tend to be stronger. At this point, there are 5 variations/mutations of covid in the US. 
Unless they're stopped, each variation could mutate further.</p>
