        <p>Yep, pediatric hospitals have been ghost towns since this started.  We need the business!</p>
<p>Seriously, I fear the cases of MIS-C related to the vaccine will keep us busy.  Buy stock in companies that make IVIG!</p>

        <p>A lot of them live without jobs.  Due current and expected low census, my hospital laid off over 40 nurses.</p>
<p>Most of us never bought into the whole hero BS.  We were just doing our jobs.  A lot did drink the Koolaid and are pushing the vaccine hard.  But there's a significant minority, about 40% of us, who are against this.  We know how it works and see how wrong it is.</p>
<p>I have no say in what the CDC or Fauci do.  I just want to take care of sick kids.  I don't support or aid in anything our "leaders" have done.</p>

        <p>I'm old enough to remember when healthcare professionals would go on strike. When they took "Do no harm" oaths. When they considered Hypochondria to be a medical condition, not a virtue.</p>
<p>&rt;I have no say in what</p>
<p>This sounds familiar... I'm sure it makes it easier to sleep when you blame other professions. Everyone thinks they are "The Good Guy" and "Can't Do Anything About it".</p>
<p>Meanwhile "The Politicians" and "The Media" and "The Teachers" and "The healthcare professionals" are the 4 legs of this dystopian stool that's been dumped on the world for over a year and counting...</p>
<p>You should probably expect a steep decline in respect and trust in your profession.</p>

        <p>Well, here's the deal Mr. (or Ms.)  self-righteous.  If we go on strike, then a lot more people will suffer.  The very people I gave my word to help will suffer and die.  Someone has to provide care.  I literally can't do anything about it besides not administering the vaccine myself and providing information so people can make their own decisions (or decisions for their minor children).  I'm not director or CEO.  So, I can't make policy.  I can keep my job so that I can continue to help people, and prevent someone who's drank the Koolaid from replacing me.</p>
<p>I honestly don't give a damn if the public respects or trusts me.  I wasn't helping sick children so they'd like me.  I'm not "The Good Guy"  I'm just a guy.  So, blame healthcare, we deserve it as a whole.  I'll keep helping those I can regardless of whether they hate me or not.</p>

        <p>&rt; Well, here's the deal Mr. (or Ms.) self-righteous.</p>
<p>Oh, did I not give you enough NIH sponsored hero worship?</p>
<p>&rt;If we go on strike, then a lot more people will suffer.</p>
<p>"We only save that kind of irresponsible behavior for pay raises!"</p>
<p>&rt;I literally can't do anything about it</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that's what every german was saying in 1946...</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not director or CEO. </p>
<p>I guess this is the answer to my original question - you sleep easy at night blaming everyone but yourself.</p>
<p>&rt;I honestly don't give a damn if the public respects or trusts me</p>
<p>Your reaction to my comments says this is VERY unlikely.</p>
<p>&rt;So, blame healthcare, we deserve it as a whole. </p>
<p>You finally got one thing right... it's interesting how long it took you and how many times you said "I can't do anything" and "It's not my fault" before you got here.</p>
<p>But don't worry. You can still blame the other 3 legs of this giant steaming stool.</p>
