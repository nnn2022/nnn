        <p>Hope doesn’t equal evidence Dr. </p>
<p>"We had hoped that when you get vaccinated and even if you did have a breakthrough infection you would have enough of an immune response that would block this protracted symptom complex now known as long COVID," says Dr. Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research.</p>

        <p>&rt;"It's really disturbing," says Dr. Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the infection, prevention and control unit with the Sheba Medical Center and an author of the study.</p>
<p>&rt;"If this is what we're going to see with all of the even mildly symptomatic infections that we're seeing now, it's definitely worrisome," she says.</p>
<p>Sounds like maybe you should have tested it before forcing it on everyone.</p>

        <p>Sounds like we’re still in phase 3 trials ?</p>
<p>Phase III</p>
<p>If the results from phase II are encouraging, we will seek to start a phase III trial. This will be a much larger trial, often involving hundreds, possibly thousands of participants coming from a range of different countries.  </p>
<p>The principle objectives in phase III are to:</p>
<p>demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the new medicine or vaccine in the typical patient likely to use it</p>
<p>confirm effective dosing levels</p>
<p>identify side effects or reasons why the treatment should not be given to people with another condition (known as ‘contraindications’)</p>
<p>build knowledge of the benefits of the medicine or vaccine and compare them with any risks
compare results against any currently achieved by existing treatments</p>
