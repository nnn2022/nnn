        <p>The og message was from the very beginning of the pandemic and before much was known about it.    I am sure there are many many such instances of things being wrong and later corrected as we learned more.   It is unreasonable to expect everyone to go back and delete our correct all old info when it is far simpler to post new info as we learn more.    It also doesn't make sense to scroll past all the newer posts (from after they learned more info about the virus) and look for older and less accurate posts from the beginning when we knew basically nothing.</p>

        <p>My "preliminary statement" on the coronavirus is that it <em>can</em> infect people, and I was right.</p>
<p>I was also right that SARS-COV-2 leaked from a lab. </p>
<p>I was also right that coughing/sneezing people are more infectious than asymptomatic people.</p>
<p>I was also right that Covid wouldn't kill more than 2% of Americans.</p>
<p>I was also right that the new inoculations would cause heart inflammation. </p>
<p>I was also right that Fauci funded gain of function research.</p>
<p>Tell me: How does having a medical degree excuse someone for issuing false information, while a layman can nail every prediction and be ridiculed for every new one they make?</p>
<p>But perhaps it's foolish of me to invest in my own research while my local doctor can confidently parrot his peers without ever reading a research paper. I'll let my physician search for tumors while I stay ahead on new information for the "vaccine".</p>

        <p>No, you are not right that SARS-CoV-2 'leaked from a lab'. In fact there is still ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE that it leaked from a lab and a hell of a lot of evidence, like various hospitals and medical researchers documenting it in bodies from 4 years ago, that SARS2 has been going around for years.</p>

<p>I would really love to see this "evidence", because I got weirdly sick in the summer of 2019, like nothing I'd ever had before, and for the last year and a half or so I've been wondering if I possibly could have had SARS-Cov2, but I just can't find any "evidence" that it was around at that time.  So, please share this "evidence" you have, I would really appreciate it.</p>

        <p>No they reported as they learned to keep the public informed of what they knew and what they were learning and corrected any wrong theories as they gained more knowledge of what was going on.    Would you have preferred that they stay silent until they had done 1000s of tests and such and just let it get completely out of hand?    I see a lot of people on here calling out China PM on here for withholding info until they knew more because they should have reported whatever they knew as soon as they knew it.    So which is it???? Report everything you know as you learn it and correct it later if you are wrong or do you agree that China did the right thing in the beginning by withholding the info because they weren't 100% sure what was going on?    You can't have it both ways so I'm interested to know where you fall on this when put into a slightly different perspective.</p>

        <p>The WHO, various medical professionals worldwide, various government leaders around the world... you people seem to believe that there is some massive conspiracy against you but for your theory to be true all the world's governments would have to had worked together to destroy the world's economy and force them into lockdown and masks for what exactly???? To get people to take a vaccine?   To stay at home??? To make a new world order??? None of these make any sense unless you are writing a terrible Nicholas Cage movie.     In the real world people and countries who HATE each other would have all had to work together for a long period of time with the goal of tricking the citizens of the world with absolutely no reward at all.    It defies logic to claim the things that are regularly claimed on this sub.   </p>
<p>I will agree that things were confusing, scary and at times frustrating as things seemed to change day to day.    But I am a reasonable adult and therefore do not expect anyone, even experts and leaders to know exactly what is happening and how to deal with it when we are looking at a brand new and unprecedented situation.    I don't think leaders and experts are in possession of a magical brain that just instantly knows things... I understand that they need to investigate and learn.    </p>
<p>I honestly think the one major mistake world's leaders and medical experts made was overestimating the intelligence and maturity of many citizens of the world when they made the decision to report what they knew as they learned new things which led to many contradictions as they learned more and revised their prior statements.   Apparently some people can not handle a world where things are not black and white.    I understand that... I also understand that it's easier to believe that this whole thing was all faked by some bad person or group because that is easier than admitting that the people in charge were just as scared and confused as the rest of us for the past 18 months.</p>

        <p>Geez, take a step back.  So, when you say 'they', you are talking about "The WHO, various medical professionals worldwide, various government leaders around the world" ?  Is that what you mean by 'they' ?</p>
<p>I want to simplify this, and have an honest discussion.  You seem to be pretty heated though.  You mention "various government leaders" and then attack "you people" while accusing 'me', who is responding to <strong>your</strong> comment of believing in "some massive conspiracy" ........ when all I asked is what you mean by 'they'.</p>
<p>Try to settle down.  Your ranting and raving is a big reason why it's hard to take you seriously.  If you have a point to make, then make it.  We try to use facts and logic and reason here, not emotion.</p>
<p>And just one more thing:  "world's leaders and medical experts" is not one thing, there are actually differing point of views.</p>
<p>If you want to settle down and have a conversation then I would be willing.  Your questioning the intelligence of people who disagree with you will not get you very far though.</p>

        <p>Sorry, just wrote this after learning that my dad who refuses to get the vaccine or take any common sense caution had been hospitalized and is very ill.    He gets all his news from fox news and social media groups like this and it may actually be killing him.   I was truly upset at the time because the attack on common sense as well as the government overreach is what bothers me.    Yes attack government overreach but still adhere to common sense.     I see a lot of things on here about "arrest xxx person" when they have committed no crime and posts bragging about convincing someone not to protect themselves or shaming someone who is trying (wearing a mask, social distancing, avoiding overly crowded places) and this is what happened to my dad... he was unsure about the vaccine and was using caution while he waited to see how others reacted to it... then he was shamed and basically bullied by some random women in a store until he decided he was going to stop wearing the mask to avoid "insane bitches screaming in his face and baaa ing like a sheep"  he was so embarrassed he chose not to protect himself after that.    </p>
<p>This is my issue.    Chiropractor, personal trainer, physical therapist, dentist and PhD in English do not equal medical doctor but I have seen these folks quoted constantly and actual medical doctors being maligned and dismissed as quacks.   I have seen data being misrepresented and I have seen absolute insane claims.    I also see people being critical over the way the pandemic was handled (which I agree with overall) but have taken their upset to an extreme level.    </p>
<p>I do not believe that there was a large scale worldwide conspiracy like many on here do.   I do believe that in the future we need to have a stronger and more solid plan in place to prevent the unrest that happened this time.</p>

<p>I don't wish to be addressed in a fashion that has come about due to what you perceive to be incorrect statements by other people.</p>
<p>I'm not going to address what you have written in yet another rant; perhaps we should start over, and only discuss what you and I each say/write.</p>
<p>I maintain that because there have been so many many mistakes made, and many many instances of hypocrisy, and many many examples of outright deception, that I see no reason for myself to get an experimental drug injected into my body for a disease that over 99.95% of the world population <em>didn't</em> die from.  Perhaps my opinion will change if and when the FDA approves any of these drugs.  I don't disparage other people for choosing what <em>they</em> think is right for themselves however.</p>

        <p>You seem like a reasonable person.    You have not denied the virus or the terrible consequences it has had for do many.    We agree that there are many things that could have been done differently.    I admit that I have many more questions than answers... I wish to concentrate on naive people like my dad who have been radicalized by this situation and the multiple echo chambers we have seen.    It's terrible that this was mishandled at times and it's sad that our last POTUS dissolved the pandemic plan right before we were actually faced with a situation where we needed it.   I understand it was a cost cutting measure but still worst possible timing.    I still don't blame him for this because he could have had no way of knowing what was coming.    </p>
<p>I agree that there have been many scary articles circulated about the vaccine as well but as a former journalist and expert researcher I can tell you that most of these were pure fiction with a grain of fact for credibility.   There is no expectation of truth or fact anymore in basic publications.    People need to either research for themselves (from credible sources) or demand government intervention to prevent the spread of misinformation but instead they fight against this by claiming that 1st amendment rights are being violated.    We are living in strange times and we can either trust in the elected officials we put into office and the medical professionals and our own judgement (not the judgement of radical and terrified people on social media) or we can turn to the hysterical masses until we become one of the crowd.   </p>
<p>I came to an interesting conclusion when I was studying journalism in university years ago... people think what others tell them to think 99% of the time but when it is done correctly they believe it is their own original idea.   This is a dangerous thing because when you believe it is your idea you will viciously defend it even if you suspect it might be wrong.   It's a terrible power to have and folks like rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones and tucker Carlson wield this power with little regard for the potential damage being done.    </p>
<p>I am only going in this vein because you seem like an intelligent person who made a thoughtful choice and who is willing to, when more information / regulation becomes available amend that choice.    I respect that and I am interested in your view point on where common sense has departed many on this sub and in the world at large.    It is sad and terrible that this has seemingly become part of some people's identity.   I would like to discuss where / if you think some have gone too far.    That the echo chamber needs to be disrupted is obvious but how to do that and bring these people out of their self imposed victim hood without insulting or belittling them?   </p>
<p>I think we can both agree that even when the FDA approved a vaccine and rational folks like yourself are satisfied there will still be scores of angry and scared people fighting against something that is no longer there because they have been told it was for so long.    How do we rescue those people from themselves and those who seek to influence them solely for the cruel entertainment of it.    We would need to start now if any dissenting ideas will hold any credibility when the time comes.</p>

        <p>That is just SO much to unravel......</p>
<p>Why is your dad naive?</p>
<p>I'm not talking about "scary articles" ..... I'm talking about an experimental drug; the fact that it is experimental is not in dispute.</p>
<p>President Trump allowed the governors of each State autonomy, which was good.  At least 5 of those governors totally botched the situation by requiring nursing homes to accept C-19 positive patients.  At least 2 of those same governors praised President Trump at the time and said he was providing what they asked for.</p>
<p>You seem to think folks on this sub who have different opinions than what we are being told are "spreading misinformation" while allowing those same people who have made mistake after mistake after mistake a pass, because "they learned new things".  <strong>Many</strong> of us saw the errors of their ways coming from miles away.</p>
<p>I'm not going to disagree with your statement that a new virus has had terrible consequences for many, but I will add that I think it's hyperbole to say so.  We could easily say the same thing about oh so many other things, but did not.  Yes, people died;  again, forcing C-19 patients into nursing homes exacerbated things by a lot, so did the over use of ventilators in my opinion.  And the lack of allowing promising therapeutics to the point of criminalizing the prescribing of them in some cases.  However, <strong>most</strong> of the people who died were extremely vulnerable (still sad, but way better than attacking our children for example) and the reported deaths at least here in the States was exaggerated.  Dr. Birx said so more than a year ago.  Hospitals were financially incentivized to record deaths as Covid-19.  People who died falling off a ladder, who happened to test positive, were classified as Covid-19 deaths.  The tests themselves were far too sensitive; a can of Coke tested positive, so did a papaya.  A new disease came around and thinned our herd ever so slightly, attacking the most vulnerable in most cases.  The <em>response</em> to the new disease attacked far more, just in different ways.  So many businesses destroyed.  Relationships ruined.  School time lost forever.  Missed medical appointments including missed cancer screenings caused unnecessary peril.  On and on.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've tried to address some of what you said, to let you know what I see from where I sit.  I am happy for the more than 99.95% of us who didn't die; for a while it didn't seem like the news would be anywhere near that good, even to me.  I think another under-appreciated aspect of the response to this thing is the stress it has caused, and continues to cause, for so many people.  Stress is bad for health.  We've been fear mongered for so long in so many ways and it <em>is</em> stressful.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could narrow the focus of this; I don't mind differing opinions, and I don't mind if it turns out I am wrong.  If you disagree with something specific I'd like to hear about it.</p>

        <p>You're missing the entire point.</p>
<p>People get stuff wrong, that's normal.</p>
<p>The problem is they are bold faced lying to you about it, telling you they NEVER said it, and you have no problem with that?</p>

        <p>Looks to me like a separate publication made that statement and as they are not the WHO and as they likely did a search but missed this very old tweet I agree that they would do well to issue a correction that they missed this old tweet and should have said WHO has not stated this since they discovered that they were wrong on xxx date.    But honestly while I am all for journalistic integrity, I think you are being a bit unrealistic.   This is a case of someone doing a bad job researching but not blatant lying as you claim.    Adding the fact that in early January 2020 the WHO briefly believed differently than what they are advising now wouldn't add or take anything away from the story.    You are reading too much into this I think.</p>
