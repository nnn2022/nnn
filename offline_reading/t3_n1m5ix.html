    <strong>My friend just passed away recently and I have to rant</strong>
    <p><p>He just tragically died from sepsis and since I was told first, I had the duty of telling some of my close family members who knew him too. I'm just so outraged right now because the moment I brought it up, before I could finish they asked "oh no... was it from covid?" No. It wasn't from fucking covid. I mean, I now its hard for people to wrap their pathetic fucking brains around the fact that people can still die of other causes nowadays, but are you fucking kidding me?! I'm trying to break tragic news and you can't even let me finish without assuming it must've been covid-related? Anyways, yeah I'm just really pissed off about it because I'm trying to grieve and let people who knew him too know that he's gone and all they can ask is if CoViD had anything to do with it. I'm so sick of everything being blamed on covid this and covid that! Anyways, thanks for reading my rant and sorry if my thoughts are all over the place. I just had to express my feelings right now because I had no where else to talk about this. I feel horrible for grieving people who have to deal with that stupid baseless assumption too.</p></p>

        <p>First off, I’m very sorry for your loss.</p>
<p>They probably hoped he did die from COVID so they could have a hissy fit about how he didn’t follow the rules and blah blah blah.</p>
<p>I swear these doomers really want this to be as deadly as possible so they can virtue signal.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your condolences. They're hard-core doomers, so it's reasonable to assume they wanted him to be a statistic so they could add him to their list of people they know who "died from covid".</p>

        <p>So sorry my friend, this is so tragic. You should be pissed off--that frustration is just so ugh-- and so relatable right now. I find it hard to tell my family anything these days because of the same bullshit knee jerk responses that are obviously programmed because these people can't or won't think for themselves. Thanks for sharing your story with us, lots of love to you and yours. You aren't alone, many of us are waking up together and we need each other support rn!</p>

        <p>Sorry for your loss. The people, who want to protect every single life from dying of Covid-19 couldn't care less if people die of other causes. You always see that really confused, sheep-like look on their faces when you tell them someone close to you died and it wasn't due to Covid. It's like they cannot cope with the fact, that people die. It's sad and people grieve, but it's no reason to stop the world from turning. And as I said, these people don't care about sick or dying people, they just care about their little social media virtue signalling bubble.</p>

No, you dumbasses, it’s his LUPUS. That he’s had for years and been hospitalized for MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE. I saw red and had to mute that group chat for a while.</p>

<p>I lost a friend to a violent motorcycle accident in august and they still listed him as a covid death. I have the direct message from a mutual friend posted on my profile to prove this. So that event also got me kinda upset, similar to your feelings you are going through.</p>
