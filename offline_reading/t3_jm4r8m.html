    <strong>Are there any posts anywhere from people who work on the NHS frontline discussing the current situation in the hospitals?</strong>
    <p><p>I don't seem to be seeing any posts from NHS workers talking about their experiences working in the Covid wards anywhere?</p>
<p>If anyone knows of any please send them my way. I'm interested to read them and I would of thought there would be more on coronavirusuk  and other subs talking about it, seeing as Boris has told us they are getting overwhelmed..</p></p>

        <p>Just a couple of anecdotes here (Canada). Anecdotal evidence is kinda trash because I could just be making this up... but I mean it's reddit so whatever here we go:</p>
<p>I know one nurse who got a job in a mobile covid clinic, I think it's to give care to homeless people specifically. She talked about it as a super cushy job. Easy hours, higher pay, very little actual work to do. She has since been continuing with her normal life - training for triathlon events, camping, traveling around the province, etc.</p>
<p>I know a care aid who works in the hospital. Since covid started he says that his job has never been better. All "optional" procedures got cancelled and so for the first time in his career they have proper staffing levels. Usually the hospital is overfilled with patients in hallways and alcoves. BUT, keep in mind that this is creating a massive backlog, and there are a huge number of people waiting for knee and hip replacements, missed cancer screenings, etc. </p>
<p>Current first year nursing students missed out on all of their practicums and hands-on experience. So now they will be going into the next phase of their training totally unprepared.</p>
