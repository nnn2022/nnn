    <strong>The lockdown in Manaus was lifted yesterday.</strong>
    <p><p>Yesterday, the governor of the Amazonas State, Wilson Lima, lifted the lockdown in Manaus and all of the state of Amazonas. Now, bars, restaurants and shopping malls can operate with time restrictions and there is a 7 PM curfew.</p>
<p>Restrictions started in early January and, in January 25th, Manaus began full lockdown with a 24 hour restriction to leave home and police barriers on the main avenues.</p>
<p>Infections climbed very quickly and Manaus became the problem poster child of the world. Now, things are getting better and what the press doesn´t tell you is that Farr´s Law is in effect and infections are falling as fast as they climbed.</p>
<p>But, when you put Amazonas in google mobility report you realize that mobility has not gotten negative at this point, but fell only to baseline February 2020.</p>
<p>Manauaras are rebellious. As a fan of motorcycles, I follow the youtube channel of a guy called "Alex da Hornet", were he was out and about in Manaus even in lockdown and he filmed that there were plenty of cars on the street. Not congestion, but lots of cars.</p>
<p>Were you expecting empty streets in Brazil? No way.</p>
<p>The rebellious manauaras also protested yesterday demanding the impeachment of Wilson Lima.</p>
<p>I can send content if you like, but it is written in Portuguese.</p></p>
