    <strong>I'm reaching my tipping point</strong>
    <p><p>I just don't know what to do, mainly because there's nothing I can do. Protests to nothing, petitions do nothing, even violence would do nothing since the general population doesn't support it and elites would just replace whoever is removed.</p>
<p>Government and corporations own and control everything, and yet so many not only are oblivious, but actively "encourage" others to shut up and obey. You have people literally saying to shut up and listen to to mandates, don't even question one bit or you're obviously a conspiracy theorist. Sometimes I'll simply ask "why" when a new mandate comes out and I'll be labeled a stupid covid denier. I guess questioning people's motives is stupid now, or just wanting to know why a mandate was made.</p>
<p>Reddit is so full of stupid, brain dead sheep, in so many of my comments regarding the lockdowns, regulations and all that, I state a literal fact that cannot be disputed, like how these lockdowns are a factor into the increase in suicide and domestic violence. I just get downvoted and people insulting me, or just create straw man arguments.</p>
<p>I'm not against vaccines in general or new medicine, I'm against letting the government have unrestricted control on what are supposed to be our rights. Where I live our leaders have been called out by third party organizations and by a smaller, but less powerful figures for violating our constitutional rights. Which they have done. We can't be in vehicles with people outside our households, go to other people's houses, go anywhere outside without a mask, go to gyms and many other types of business, or buy anything that's considered "non-essential" (Ex: children's backpacks). "bUt Op, JuSt OrDeR oNliNe, LiKe AmAzOn!". No I fucking won't. Why would I want to give an insanely rich company even more money when they don't even follow regulations themselves??? Oh also yeah let's destroy even more local businesses, as I've seen so many happen around me, I'm just lucky that my parents business hasn't collapsed yet and left us without money, as jobs are almost non existent, cause of lockdowns and regulations of course. Also who the fuck is deciding what and what isn't essential?!? When looking over what's considered essential or not, it just seems so random and doesn't seem to follow any sort of reason.</p>
<p>It's also insane to me that people are dying of treatable ailments because hospitals have to keep the amount of people down to prevent covid, which has a 99%+ survival rate. I've heard countless stories of people's family members dying of cancer because their treatments kept getting postponed. My mother personally knew someone who had covid and then died in a car crash, their death certificates said the cause of death was covid, so that's one thing to consider when looking at the numbers of apparent "covid deaths".</p>
<p>How utterly stupid do people have to be to think that the government is doing this for our own interests, even though they've never done it before. I'm not saying this is a global conspiracy where the globe is controlled by elites, but it's undeniable that people in power are taking advantage of this, and there's no reason for them to stop. How about people that are scared of covid cower and fear and do what they think they need to do, instead of forcing the entire world to.</p>
<p>I just don't know what to do, and like the title says, I'm reaching my tipping point, I'll probably just give up on trying to convince anyone to use critical thinking and just let things happen, since nothing I can do as an individual is ever going to change anything. The only way I see things changing for the better is if people unite, but I found that in my local communities the majority of people just listen to what the government and media has to say.</p>
<p>I'll just shut up and wear my damn mask.</p></p>

        <p>You’re not alone, even though it seems like it sometimes. Many people feel the same, but see the reaction they see from the masses when people like me and you ask questions makes them too fearful to speak up. Don’t give up, and try to keep your cool when interacting about this stuff, let them make fools of themselves in anger.</p>

        <p>Well if you don't know what to do.. shameless self-plug of my own idea but: https://i.redd.it/higf4d4no0761.jpg</p>
<p>Basically it's the mask psyop in reverse. It'll work if it gains enough popularity. I guarantee it. </p>
<p>All I need is for this to gain popularity among us insiders. From there it ought  to be easy enough too get the word out to everyone else. </p>
<p>If you don't like that, I could use you if you can code. Working on a protest planning website/app that will be very useful once it's done. It's strictly free and open source.</p>

        <p>I know very minimal coding, but I like the idea! There seems no way for us to unite our individual communities since there's so much division. but I honestly believe that as an online community we can work together.

        <p>&rt;nothing I can do as an individual is ever going to change anything</p>
<p>I've often had this thought during my lifetime but I know that when I first stopped eating meat, there were virtually no vegetarian products for sale commercially. And now look how many there are. We all have the power to change things by our actions. For the last 2 years I've refused to buy anything with palm oil in because they're cutting down virgin rainforest to produce it and destroying the only habitat on earth where oragutans live. I feel like I'm pissing into the wind with this one because there are so many products which use it and I've even heard vegans defending it but because I've seen what can happen when you stand up for what you know is right, I'm just going to keep doing it.</p>

        <p>This is solvable by just refusing to feed their system. They can do all that you listed for no other reason than the fact that we support it.</p>
<p>There has been many videos about hospital negligences on purpose. Where they intentionslly manipulate tests or place normal patients with Covid infected ones. The problem is that out of 500 workers in that hospital, only one had the guts to say "No" and expose it.</p>
<p>Now I am not saying leave your job tomorrow, what I am saying is: start finding a way to stop feeding the system and start working towards it.</p>
