    <strong>"Approving of the world" by Bertolt Brecht (1930)</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not unjust, I’m not courageous either.</p>
<p>They pointed out their world to me today</p>
<p>I saw the bloodstains on the pointing finger</p>
<p>And quickly said “I like my world that way”.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I stood before their world, beneath their truncheons,</p>
<p>And spent the whole day judging all I saw.</p>
<p>Saw butchers who seemed suited to their functions,</p>
<p>And when they asked, D’you like it? I said 'Sure!'</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And from that instant, my professed opinion was:</p>
<p>Better be a coward than in your grave!</p>
<p>To keep from falling under their dominion,</p>
<p>I kept approving what one can’t approve.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I saw the cops and landlords profiteering;</p>
<p>With hollow cheeks, the people doffed their caps.</p>
<p>I tried their wheat, and told all within hearing,</p>
<p>'Top quality, a little dear perhaps.'</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then the industrialists - such crippling losses.</p>
<p>They can't find work for more than one in three.</p>
<p>I told the other two, 'You'd better ask your bosses,'</p>
<p>I'm ignorant about economy!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I saw the soldiers preferring guns to butter,</p>
<p>And planning whom to murder and to rob!</p>
<p>I called out as I stepped down in the gutter:</p>
<p>Credit where credit's due, they know their job!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Saw Civil-Servants green with mildew keeping</p>
<p>Their great big mobile dungheap-shifter on the move.</p>
<p>So poorly paid for bullying and creeping;</p>
<p>I really hope their salaries improve!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I saw the teachers, those poor flagellators</p>
<p>Imposing their own image on the young</p>
<p>That’s what they get their stipends from the state for</p>
<p>Or else they have to starve, so you should hold your tongue!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And children seen in early adolescence</p>
<p>Whose brains are eight and bodies eighty-three</p>
<p>I say “that’s life” – to the unspoken question</p>
<p>“Why’s life like that?” I answer “Don’t ask me!”</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And the professors, whose impressive phrases</p>
<p>Excuse the deeds of those whom they support</p>
<p>Crime wrapped in talk of economic crises</p>
<p>Let no one say they’re any worse than I had thought!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>That tradesman there, assuring all and sundry</p>
<p>'It's not my fish, but I who really smell!'</p>
<p>Won’t eat bad fish himself, so let’s all get to know him</p>
<p>And hope that he may find us fit to sell!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Doctors who throw back every hard-up patient,</p>
<p>Like anglers throwing back a too-small fish,</p>
<p>I can’t avoid, and lay my sickly body</p>
<p>upon their couch to carve up as they wish.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I saw the murderers and the victims also,</p>
<p>And with a bleeding heart and failing nerve,</p>
<p>Saw how the murderers singled out their victims</p>
<p>and shouted 'I approve - without reserve!'</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I see them coming, see the butchers marching,</p>
<p>Would like to call out 'Stop!', but since, meanwhile,</p>
<p>I know their agents are behind me watching;</p>
<p>I hear my own voice calling at them 'Heil!'</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Since poverty and baseness leave me cold</p>
<p>My pen falls silent; times are on the move</p>
<p>Yet all that’s dirtiest in your dirty world</p>
<p>Includes, I know, that fact that I approve.</p></p>
