        <p>Now I’m assuming a lot of things about this article, based on the content, style and URL’s of your link. I spent only a few minutes but I would say this seems like bullshit.<br>
When I eventually found my way (via links in the article) to the ‘study’, it seems to be a classic Covid BS study, small and selective group tested, with no control group etc. I spent two minutes, so maybe I’m wrong.</p>

        <p>They make two conclusions: Higher viral load is correlated with asymptomatic patients, and higher viral load is correlated with younger age and better outcomes.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We KNOW that last conclusion is incorrect, so it invalidates the asymptomatic viral load postulation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7395516/pdf/pnas.202008373.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7395516/pdf/pnas.202008373.pdf</a></p>
<p>\^\^ THIS paper is the origination of the "asymptomatic spread is significant" (where you end up if you drill down through the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html">CDC's references</a>), which is just a theoretical, mathematic model, based on THIS paper:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5</a></p>
<p>However, even this paper doesn't directly measure pre-symptomatic viral load, ( only post-symptomatic decline), with more guesswork/modeling on incubation periods for secondary attack rates. For rationality, this paper leans on the following Pre-Covid influenza paper which tracks pre-symptomatic viral load:</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28011603/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28011603/</a></p>
<p>This final paper shows influenza, asymptomatic viral loads to be 10 to 100 times less than symptomatic, and that the viral load only becomes significant at most a day before symptom onset in symptomatic patients</p>
<p>This is the kinda crap science that the mask mandates are based on. I just went down this same rabbit hole myself today. Weak evidence of significant asymptomatic spread.</p>

        <p>Well, right off the bat, the first paragraph of substance is this doozy..”A total of 360 samples from 60 patients were obtained upon admission. Of these, 25 percent did not have symptoms, while 75 percent were symptomatic.” Now, ignoring that they’re claiming 15 were hospitalized ~without~ symptoms, no reputable study would ever achieve any concrete conclusion from a sample size of 60. This is junk journalism posing as junk science, it’s laughable.</p>

        <p>Yeah I thought it was a ridiculously small sample size as well. I figured the people hospitalized without symptoms were people tested when they were admitted for something else. At least, where I live they test everyone in the hospital even if it is unrelated to why they're actually there.</p>

        <p>Exactly, people whose immune systems were already compromised by some other affliction are somehow used as a control group (of 15!) for a “scientific” study. Any scientist would roll their eyes at this, at least any with a sliver of integrity.</p>
