        <p>I've noticed that Northam has definitely relished his new role as tyrant with the onset of the pandemic.</p>

        <p>See, I don't mind restrictive measures be put in place as long as there are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A clear and reasonable rationale behind them that isn't filled with emotional words or flowery language.</li>
<li>A solid expiration date</li>
<li>Measures put in place to make it so inconvenient to extend them indefinitely without putting pain to those people who would attempt to extend them (that is to say: make the process so difficult that if extending restrictions becomes your job to the exclusion of doing the job you were supposed to do in the first place, thus hampering any chances of re-election because of an apparent obsession with restricting the public at large)</li>
<li>A daily communication of all numbers and information that is leading to any government decisions that is publicly available and verifiable, which by the way, includes number of businesses in danger of closing over the next restriction period and number of potentially unemployed (as in: balance of all the facts, not just about the thing that's causing the restrictions).  </li>
<li>The willingness to allow the constituents to vote on the matter</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I know that takes work.  But putting stop-gaps in the process of restrictions will give time to think about things rather than having knee-jerk reactions to what the average person thinks we should do as opposed to what is best for society at large.  </p>
<p>I am absolutely a proponent of making sure that if you as a government official want restrictions, you'd better be willing to bet your ass on making the right call.</p>
