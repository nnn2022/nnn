    <strong>A reminder: This "new normal" nonsense will end.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm noticing a lot more negativity and more people giving into what I call "doomerism" on this sub. I just want to let you all know this new normal will not last.People can only be inconvenienced for so long before they start pushing back. Here are some things I think people that have fallen into doomerism should do.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a break from the news and social media. More often than note its just more of the same bs the news has been spewing since March. Social media has always been a toxic cessepool in the first place. So drop it for awhile a week or two. I can promise you, you're mood will get lifted from doing this.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Shop at less strict stores. This is likely something we are all dealing with. Most business aredemanding customers wear masks. Pick and choose based on how strict they are. The places I'mshopping now don't seem to mind me wearing a mesh mask.Of course you can always do the shoponline/delivery or pick up.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not let restrictions and lock downs get in the way of doing the things you love. I like taking motorcycle out to the lake. My state is on and off about closing down the lake. That doesn't stop me from taking a nice long ride to the lakes in other states/ or the ocean if I wanna make an entire weekend out of it. I loved going to the cinema but that doesn't stop me from throwing lil movie fests at work. Do not let the states nonsense from keeping you doing things you enjoy and love.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>Avoid doomer family and friends as best as you can. Find out which of your family and friends are against these lock downs and get together with them. Nobody can stop you from having your pals over and have a cookout and jam session. People can't stop you from you and your significant other having a picnic in a public park. People may sneer and say things but shrug it off. They are the ones not living their lives.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As time goes on more and more people will see the government overstepped and totally overreacted to this novel virus. We are seeing mass protests against this lock downs across the globe. The populace is waking up. This will pass.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Enter the resident doomers that are immune to being banned .Comment and spew their negativity. But honestly I'd rather if you wanna be a negative nancy you do it in another thread.</p></p>

        <p>I noticed the same trend going on, and interestingly enough I have cought myself feeling the same this week. My fiance says similar things you do and it does help. I usually try to think this way, but it can get hard. I'm stuck in the north east where it seems like no end.</p>
<p>I think you're right though. The tides are turning around here and people are waking up. I'm just impatient sometimes. </p>
<p>Staying away from social media and toxic people helps a lot. I'm an outdoorsy person and I keep doing my thing even when stuff is closed and it has been a savior for me. </p>
<p>I think my problem is I cought lyme disease 3 weeks ago and had been stuck inside for a while because of it. It ended up working out though because the treatment has seemed to have cured my other issues  so my doc has taken me off the immunosuppressants I was on for good! </p>
<p>I am super stoked but I have a habit of negativity with all that's going on. I always appreciate your positivity. I think it helps a lot of us with these times.</p>
<p>I do believe people are waking up. I have a feeling this winter we will see people getting fed up and hopefully taking (peaceful) action.</p>

        <p>I contend that those who do not want to wear a mask should not under any circumstances. Keep going to different stores until you find one not enforcing it.  Get delivery or curbside if you have to. Yes it takes some guts to walk into a store and be told to leave. Usually if I say “I can’t wear one” or “I have an underlying condition which prevents me from wearing one,” I’ve been told “ok” and it’s not a problem. I’m in and out and don’t talk to anyone.</p>

        <p>This has been my experience. No matter what the sign on the door says, as long as you don't make a scene or draw attention to yourself you should be fine. And although most places won't publicly mention it, a lot of stores, mainly larger ones have non-confrontation policies with regards to masks. That's not to say other customers won't Karen out on you, but you may not get kicked out by staff if you keep calm.</p>

        <p>I suppose I can agree with that. I think different states might be more rebellious that others. Unfortunately I'm in Cali where there is a track record for this sort of bowing down to the government.</p>

        <p>The United States is the third largest country in the world and the strongest economy on Earth. What happens in the States affects the rest of the world. Economic policies in the U.S. tend to ripple through the global economy. Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist or anything, but you will notice the folks who are really pushing the gloom and doom COVID agenda tend to be politically to the left. Their ultimate goal is to scare the U.S. to vote out the incumbent president, which would result in a major shift in foreign policy, i.e., from the current nationalist/populist paradigm to one that is more global. To put it more simply, the allies of the U.S. would much prefer a president that plays nicely with others. Therefore it is to their benefit to get rid of Trump ... and ultimately give them a slight leg up over Russia, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc.</p>

        <p>Here's another way to look at it: if you are an Aussie citizen, pretend you had a vote in the U.S. election ... obviously you don't, but just pretend for a moment. Who would you pick?</p>

        <p>I am Australian, in NSW. Where I am people didn't even follow the restrictions the first time and the police ignored massive gatherings and parties and all. Also today I was at a crowded market and yesterday too. Places like pubs are secretly letting people dance. So many people around here think it's ridiculous. Unless done by force, as I'm aware could happen like Victoria, people here will not follow anything Gladys tries. I'm not in the city so would be hard for total control.</p>

        <p>I'm honestly hoping despite the negativity towards it, the US will lead the way for the rest of the world when people have had enough of this garbage (and then the Swedish will sit back and say, "that's nice, but we were here first").  </p>
<p>People mock the "freedom" argument, but the truth is, the reason that such freedoms should be enshrined into law is so that nobody can make exceptions, and then use those exceptions to drive loopholes and extensions.  </p>
<p>We've had these declarations in place, not despite extraordinary circumstances, but primarily <em>because of</em> them.  </p>
<p>The US declared independence precisely because of the extraordinary circumstance of not wanting to be ruled by a foreign power anymore.  </p>
<p>Now, in the face of another extraordinary circumstance, people are willing to lay down their rights and they can't even adequately explain a game plan for getting them back.</p>
<p>"Well, it's just another two weeks..."</p>
<p>Sure it is, buttercup.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go have fun while you cower at home until Big Daddy Government and the Big Brother citizens that will film you if you step incorrect keep you in place tell you it's okay for you to enjoy your life again.</p>

        <p>And as an addendum, those who would say, "well, it's a <em>virus</em>"...yes, it is.</p>
<p>And if you're concerned about that two weeks of the virus burning itself out, how about you stay home for three months while those of us who want to go out catch it (and by your standard die from it).</p>
<p>You'll be safe in your bubble while the virus kills us, and it was our right to let that happen.</p>
<p>I mean, it will kill us, right?  There's no reason to think we'll all still be alive after what, two weeks?  A month?</p>
<p>The new, perfect, CV-free world will be safe for you and no one will ever get sick and die again, and you will have missed out on nothing because you were the <em>good</em> ones who waited it out and it will disappear forever.  </p>

        <p>I've been in a total funk, but taking a break from the constant bad news has helped. Taking time to work on projects, repairing things around the house, etc has really helped. I'm coming out of it a bit now. </p>
<p>Endless amounts of bad news can be very hard on your sense of well-being. I'm not saying we shouldn't be informed, but obsessing over it won't make it change any faster. Even if we are convinced it's going to go one way--bad or good--none of us really knows what is going to happen. It's a lot easier to take it a day or a week at a time. I don't have the bandwidth to worry about what is going to happen in 2025 yet. </p>
<p>I've noticed far more people grumbling in my state about the way things are being handled, which given how popular our governor was at the beginning of this shit show, is saying something. It isn't huge progress, but a change from a wall of fawning adoration to  a mix that includes way more anger and frustration is progress. It's taking a LOT longer than I would like, but it is happening.</p>

        <p>The only problem with step 2 is that California, and especially the Bay Area, has all their stores with these strict rules. So there are "mask or Kickout" mandates in every store.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me that doesn't get my spirits down. I comply there but the moment I'm out my mask comes off</p>

        <p>I appreciate what you're saying and I may be one of the "doomers" you're talking about. I don't like labelling people simply in this way, whether they are on my side or not. Not saying I've never succumbed to it, political labels can be a good shorthand.</p>
<p>I would only ask you to respect that we are all in different geographical places and so we may be going through very different levels of "feeling doom", based on the policy developments where we are, -- so the light at the end of the tunnel is different for all of us. I'm in an area that I figured would be late to the party, and was correct. In April and May stores (etc) here were doing way less than they are now, even though nothing has changed here. Predicting the town council vote, I will soon be forced to wear a mask where I am, and so I critically look at what other, continuously more extreme policies may come next.</p>
<p>New Zealand is now relocating people! It's supposedly a "democracy"! Public-health/-emergency laws are extreme in that they allow politicians to suspend democracy, and they have never been used with such extremity before, at least in modern times, in most places. </p>
<p>We cannot let our guard down. I would rather take the risk of having been too concerned, and been wrong, when it comes to the freedom of myself and others.</p>

        <p>I hope you're right, I really do. Here in the UK the tide may be turning, but so slowly.</p>
<p>The sooners are still out in force, busy trying to make everyone conform to their appeasement of the great god covid.</p>

        <p>The irony of blind optimism is that it only pushes these things longer in a blind optimism because people become convinced that they should do nothing. It's a bit like people trying to use lockdowns to curtail deaths only to cause more. Reality is weird like that.</p>
<p>Still, taking actions like some that you propose are worthwhile and more effective than individuals want to believe.</p>

        <p>I appreciate this advice, but its not going to end until the hysteria ends. And it not going to end until they get a vaccine fall in their lap, which won't happen until fall 2021. </p>
<p>The extra unemployment money is gone, and the governors have already dug their heels and scream "give me bailout or vaccine".</p>
<p><strong>Even when this is over, we are scarred for life from this. We can't look forward or do anything in the future in fear it will be robbed again by tyrant governors and enabling legislatures.</strong> And none of the candidates for congress where I live are anti lockdown</p>
