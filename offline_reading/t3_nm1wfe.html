    <strong>How likely do you think is the possibility that COVID vaccine verification will be required for employment and renting in NYC in the near future?</strong>
    <p><p>Backstory: I was offered a job/training opportunity lasting a few years in NYC. In my field, it's the best possible opportunity. Seriously, the institute at which I'll be training is highly competitive and only accepts a few candidates from around the globe per year. I'll be an expert in my field, I'll have many quality employment opportunities, I'll be set.</p>
<p>However, I'm really highly skeptical of the COVID vaccine, and it seems NYC is a leader in mandatory vaccination and vaccine passports.</p>
<p>I don't really care about requirement for proof of vaccination to enter restaurants and bars. I live a pretty monastic lifestyle. But, I'll be working in a field that requires interaction with people. No touching, just sitting in a room together. </p>
<p>Where I live currently, I can get by without disclosing my vaccine status, and am close to starting my own business wherein I won't have to worry about it. Furthermore, I live in a rent controlled apartment in a very desirable neighborhood in a very desirable part of the country. It's really difficult to leave.</p>
<p>I'm willing to risk it all for this opportunity in NYC, I'm just afraid it will fall apart because I won't consent to being vaccinated at this time, nor will I for the next few years at least.</p>
<p>I imagine people here are much more aware of developing trends around mandating vaccines and vaccine passports. What do you predict? Will my refusal to get vaccinated likely affect my ability to work and live in NYC? I'm open to living in NJ, which I know is a little more lax about this, but would still need to work in NYC.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></p>

        <p>Like I believe this vaccine has the potential to interfere with you spiritually (because I felt like something tried to overtake me after I had it yesterday) but from this world point I feel like it itself is a terrible precedent that sets us up for global dictatorship. The vaccine passport is just an excuse based on the data of a 99.8% survival rate for most people to put draconian measures in place. Bezos just bought MGM too. Yeeesh prepare for more propaganda</p>
