        <p>The problem with trying to convince some people that this is a bad thing is that most people who support communism don't seem to know anything about the way communism has trampled people.</p>
<p>And the media has mocked concerns about communism so much that people can't even see it when it's happening right before their eyes.</p>

        <p>They also don't understand that communism is more than just economic policies that dont' work. It's also the destruction of culture and tradition. It's both a top down system and a bottom up system where neighbors and family members spy on each other for the government. Where detractors or those who speak out against it are <em>disappeared.</em> There is of course, a lot more to it than that, but my point is that, as you said, people don't know anything about communism.</p>

        <p>Those people really need to visit a socialist/communist country and hear it from the inside. I went on a school abroad trip once and one of the guides reminded us at every opportunity why it doesn't work and sucks for the people. He'd be like, "see that bridge over there? My own country couldn't even afford to finish it. Capitalist countries paid for that." He was older so he'd talk about the before/after and how it affected him, some of these kids and even adults need to hear this stuff from someone who has lived it. Even then some of them would be like "well we'll do it differently!" 🙄😒</p>

        <p>First of all, none of those things have anything to do with capitalism. </p>
<p>Secondly, we do have equal rights in America. So you're just wrong there. </p>
<p>Lastly, capitalism is based off of consensual transactions, unlike communism and socialism which are based on theft and force. It's lifted something like 80% of the world's population out of poverty. You completely lack historical perspective. You hate capitalism so much? Than get off of your phone. Get off of the internet. Get rid of your automobile. Never purchase anything ever again. Get off your computer. Never use heating or air conditioning. Get rid of any clothing you have. Sell your house or leave your apartment and go live in the wilderness. That way you can be totally free of the evil capitalism and everything its made.</p>

        <p>Your verifiably wrong hun</p>
<p>&rt;we do have equal rights in America</p>
<p>Any minority/woman will disagree</p>
<p>&rt;capitalism is based off of consensual transactions,</p>
<p>You're confusing trade and commerce with capitalism. Capitalism is based on the invisible hand which does not exist. If it did corporations/millionaires would not get tax breaks and incentives from the government. Actual capitalism is closer libertarianism or social darwinism which rewards stealing, lying and getting your own. </p>
<p>&rt;It's lifted something like 80% of the world's population out of poverty</p>
<p>That's also verifiably not true. Ever since Reagan and the neo capitalits the poverty/wage gap in the entire world has increased significantly. Huge human rights atrocities were communities in the 80s/90s in the name of capitalis</p>
<p>Since you love capitalism so much you definitely don't accept any government help for you or your loved ones right? None of this socialist BS staying on mommy and daddy's health insurance right?</p>

<p>You're in a sub which gives daily updates about gigantic multinational drug companies who see the public as a market, who own medical journals, rig research and bribe regulators. </p>

        <p>Maybe, but the mafia sets the rules in the first place, and it conditions people to snitch through mandating people spend over a decade in the  indoctrination system. People can snitch and set their own business rules, but the mafiosi imprison people and steal from them.</p>

        <p>Well when you think of a mafia, most people think of a group of thugs who run a protection racket, where they steal from innocent people in exchange for "protection", when the mafia themselves are the greatest threat.</p>
<p>So they might, for instance, take half of the money you earn and, if you don't pay up, they'll either use violence to forcibly take it from you, or they'll kidnap and imprison you to set an example.</p>
<p>That's what I mean when I say mafia, but most people refer to them as government...</p>

        <p>Actually communism is at least partially a bottom up authoritarian system. The government convinces people that it it is for their own good to socially enforce policies on their community members. In the USSR, 1 in 3 people was an informant for the government. That means you couldn't even speak freely around your own family members.</p>

<p>Damn I didn't know that. Crazy how Western people still do this today with rule-breakers and don't see what they're doing.</p>
<p>The reason I'm tolerant of socialists though is the one's I've come across advocate for a peoples' government instead of a mafia like the USSR had. They think if people voted for policies instead of psychopaths it'll work.</p>
<p>I'm still an AnCap though, but I'm trying to get capitalists and commies to tolerate each other so we stand a better chance against the true enemy - the state.</p>

<p>Socialism is the total end of enlightenment culture and the rise of permeant plutocratic dystopia.</p>
<p>If you want something to support, support the western workers rights movement and organized labor, not international capitalists claiming to be commies.</p>

        <p>This is the neo Marxist agenda at play. This is how they usher in fascism. It’s always under the pretence of keeping you safe. They manufacture fear and get people into a state where they willingly give away their civil liberties and rights. All because they are afraid. People need to study history. This is happened before many times</p>

Actually I take that back that's uniquely uneducated, happens all the time. PolPot, Mao more recently Putin... They prey on the ignorant bcs they are so damn easy to trick.

        <p>How can you be so right and blind at the same time. Why do all of you <strong>only</strong> talk about covid which is verifiably true, but <strong>not</strong> about 9/11, the patriot act, the war on terror. That is the dictionary definition of taking away freedoms to keep you safe. Sheeple in this sub were and are  soo compliant after 9/11 bcs obviously it's much easier to do battle by meme, bumper stickers and the occasional confrontation at a store when you refuse to follow guidelines. But when there was a real issue all of you were silent,. It's so obvious you snowflakes are so frail you only fight the easy fights.</p>

        <p>&rt;9/11, the patriot act, the war on terror.</p>
<p>I was against the patriot act from the beginning. I could see that people at the time were metaphorically begging the governed to restrict their rights and freedom in the name of the ILLUSION of safety. Whether it's 9/11 or covid,  I have no sympathy for those who want to absolve themselves of the responsibility to keep themselves safe and cede power to government in hopes that it will do the job FOR them.</p>

<p>And so were many people but there was no where near the opposition you have like w covid. Everyone will deny it but it's politics. Had the orange rapist taken it seriously then I doubt we'd even have this group. If the sexual assaulter conman had been elected in 2000 and promoted conspiracy theories about the attack, then maybe the patriot act wouldn't have passed but bcs you had white respected Republican everyone did what they were told. Still do. 20 yrs later you still can't take water and have body scanning machines</p>

        <p>Ok, I have to spell it out for you. If you want to impart your clearly superior knowledge it is not enough to write out fancy terms. I encourage you to follow Einstein who said making things simpler is much more difficult. Anyone can throw fancy terms, but can you explain what you mean in layman's terms?</p>
<p>I did understand unproven allegations which legally is correct and everyone is innocent until proven innocent <strong>in a fair and unbiased legal system</strong> humans have not achieved pure unbias. He said they said, over and over and over. Paying off women while totally legal further bolsters allegation of misconduct.</p>
<p>I also understood supposition not fact. It's impossible to prove a negative, so all we have is logic and educated guesses based on cold hard facts. Yes Bill Clinton was likely an abuser, no Hillary does not run a sex ring in a pizzeria basement.</p>

        <p>If you want to learn what communism is you should read economics. Both the liberals Smith, Ricardo, Keynes and communist Marx, Engels. You'd learn that communism has never been implemented as it is in theory. That the Soviet Union wasn't how Marx imagined communism and that he was not evil at all, he was really concerned about human well being. </p>
<p>Also read some political science Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Maquiavel, Bobbio, etc and you will learn what totalitarism mean </p>
<p>1984, animal farm they don't explain at all what communism is. They are critics to a government not a economic system.</p>

        <p>That's because communism isn't just an economic system. The problem is that Marx put his theory on paper, but when it's implemented it looks exactly like how it did in Russia, China, and anywhere else. All of those problems are baked into the cake of communism.</p>

        <p>Depends what kind of communism. China's take on it - no thanks. Hippie blazed campfire communism - sounds like a blast.</p>
<p>I don't really have a problem with the ideology, it's the authoritarians who want to fucking murder capitalists that I have a problem with.</p>
<p>I just wish capitalists and commies would stop fighting because we'd be so much stronger together. It's crazy how the mafia (government) takes our money (capital) and interferes with the market, suppressing capitalism. Meanwhile, the state in societies that identify as communist or socialist always cause hyperinflation, famines, wars, poverty, etc., suppressing communism.</p>
<p>People always use straw man arguments like calling the USSR communist and the US capitalist, when they both have a murderous mafia that only serves to keep the poor poor.</p>
<p>It's classic divide and conquer which has made capitalists think communism = USSR and commies think capitalist = the West.</p>
<p>Don't people see that these can co-exist and people can choose where they want to live as long as there's no mafia running the show?</p>

        <p>Human nature will always get in the way, though.</p>
<p>The mafia that you are speaking of is just what humans with power do. There’s no way around it. In communism, people do end up with more power through their jobs. While it might not be money, it is food, medicine, and supplies.</p>
<p>Read George Orwell’s “Animal Farm” for example. It is a perfect example of what happens.</p>

        <p>I think the problem has always been the authority construct, which causes people to obey command and justify themselves doing evil things because someone tells them to. Without a mafia and their laws and perceived authority, people would be responsible for their own actions.</p>
<p>I haven't read animal farm, but I think in capitalism people can choose to buy from non-corrupt businesses to take power from corrupt ones, and with communism the the people vote on decisions instead of electing selfish mafiosi to do it.</p>

        <p>Because getting a shot isn't a big deal if you are an adult. Nothing "off" about it. Is it a moving goalpost? Yes. Everyday is a new set of data. Clearly this is a very adaptable virus thst will probably be a part of our lives for decades, but things will open up regardless.

        <p>We get booster shots for all sorts of diseases. I learned my lesson 2 years ago when I got influenza and had not been vaccinated. It wrecked me pretty good. I usually don't bother to get it either. After that though I've changed my tune.</p>
<p>I understand the mistrust. Big Pharma/Health Insurance companies should not be trusted easily. They usually gouge us for medication thst frequently do as much harm as they do good. If it weren't for my primary care provider, I wouldn't trust it either.</p>
<p>You make a valid point about me living in a city. Cities are always the most impacted by disease due to population density. More rural are less likely not be impacted as harshly, therefore not take it as seriously. </p>
<p>Let's not belittle each other. Just calling someone "brainwashed" or "Under their spell" isn't helpful and drives the narrative that means to divide the common man. I live in a blue city in a red state, but I grew up in a very rural area. </p>
<p>We all just want to believe what makes us feel what we want to feel. People want to feel scared. Of the government or of the virus. People want to be scared of something out of their control, because then they don't have to work on themselves. They can just be upset and say "See! Its all their fault I am miserable". There is a lot of people in for a wake up call when they realize they are sad due to their own place in life.</p>

        <p>I live in a big blue city as well. I’ve also had Covid and for me, it was a mild cold that came and went. My husband didn’t get sick at all and only one of my two toddlers was sick (very mild). I also recently got tested for the Covid antibodies and it came back positive, as expected. </p>
<p>All that being said, Covid is different for everyone, but my experience is similar to the experience of <em>most</em> people who’ve had Covid. Of course there are exceptions, but if you’re healthy and under the age of 70, your chances of death or even severe symptoms from Covid are almost zero. This reality coupled with the government’s ~~coercing, threatening, blackmailing~~ strong push for people to get vaxed is making me even more skeptical of the need for this vaccine. I don’t care if people do decide to get it, but there is absolutely no reason for me to get it and I’m certainly not rolling the dice on this new vaccine pushed by an administration that I do not trust; an administration that will shamelessly continue their theatrics just to push their agenda. </p>
<p>And don’t get me started on the media and the peddled fear they’ve been pushing since day one. Anything the media is shitting and farting about, you should absolutely not trust. Also a good idea to pay attention to what is being censored because that is usually where you’ll find the actual truth… and let’s be honest, <em>a lot</em> of “misinformation” has been censored.</p>

        <p>Businesses were forced to close.  I guess the thought was that the stimulus would be turned into a permanent UBI, though it looks like the stimulus is starting to wind down and any further stimulus will probably be like a one time 300 dollar check.  I don’t see enhanced unemployment benefits being paid out again once they expire.</p>

        <p>Sorry for the late reply, I had typed a response, reddit reloaded, and I lost it all :-(</p>
<p>Anyway, I should've prefaced my comment with the fact that I'm in the UK but I had assumes a similar thing happened in the US.</p>
<p>Over here, all "non-essential" businesses were forced to close for in-person trading, only those with capacity for online logistics were allowed to operate. These closures also included things that any reasonable person would consider "essential" such as children's clothing and shoes. </p>
<p>When controls like this happen, the market is definitely not free, at least in any real sense of the word. Only large companies (such as amazon, etc. or those with capacity to ship their products) are really able to get to their customers meaningfully. </p>
<p>There's no denying the fact that this massively benefits huge companies like amazon. It's in their best interests to keep the market like this for as long as possible. Meanwhile, while opening a children's shoes store was illegal, I walked past a number of open luxury chocolate shops in London, so it's ridiculous to insinuate that these rules were truly logically about stopping a virus. As we come out of lockdown now, we are told each restriction lifting will be driven by "data, not dates" yet the government refuse to publish the criteria for making decisions based on "the data".</p>
<p>Now this is where I get into biased hypotheticals but it's no secret that the UK conservative party have many financial scandals - after all, just this week we just had a scandal about the Prime Minister's flat refurbishments and his £840-a-roll wallpaper (\~$1175). Then was the matter of who paid for it, the answer is Boris Johnson paid for it personally himself but it looks like he only did that when he was caught. Apparently a party donor might have initially paid for it and he was asked this question in parliament which he wouldn't answer. This is all to say lots of powerful people benefit from this, and we have conservative party politicians with no morals willing to take money from mysterious "donors"...</p>
<p>I know this has gone around the subject a bit but unlike a lot of outsiders on this sub (I had someone tell me the other day that I was selfish to want democracy at a time like this, that even postal votes were "too dangerous", etc.), you seem genuinely curious about what lockdown skeptics believe. I find subs like this frustrating sometimes because there are crazy conspiracists here which everyone outside like to focus on. We're not all like that - I even wore a mask before they were recommend but I am very strongly against mandating them. I think the point where I went very strongly against lockdown was when they made protesting illegal. That was never ok and I will never accept that it will be.</p>

        <p>What you say about the economy functioning to the benefit of big companies like Amazon during this period makes sense. That's sounds more like an oligopoly than communism though, no?</p>
<p>Let me explain why the situation in the US made me more skeptical of the idea: mainly just because different states did different things; some closed down certain businesses, others did not (Texas and Florida are examples of states that went with very few lockdown/restrictions). I live in a state where everything was a pretty-please suggestion, so people have been more or less business as usual. It sounds like the UK is a bit more centralized.</p>

        <p>Ah my bad, it was in my original reply but I don’t believe that what I describe is communism.</p>
<p>I did however mean to include those who are worried about communism in my reply. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/worldeconomicforum/2016/11/10/shopping-i-cant-really-remember-what-that-is-or-how-differently-well-live-in-2030/?sh=acf36c717350">things like this from the World Economic Forum</a> certainly indicate a push for a form of modern communism. Lots of people rightly worry about the vast gains in government power (such as the UK literally outlawing protests) and how these can be used to implement schemes like this - after all, these restrictions make most of the population more reliant on the state. </p>
<p>The laws in the UK are different between England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales but they were mostly similar with slightly different dates and timescales.</p>

        <p>They're attempting to push communism on people all over the world. Do you not know/understand what communism is? From Black Lives Matter to "Build Back Better" they're attempting to push a cultural revolution (Marxism) while simultaneously pushing towards socialism by getting people addicted to government handouts.</p>

It's not this critical race theory, which is apart of critical theory, which comes from Marx. It's the stimulus checks. You nailed it.</p>

        <p>Yes, yes, we are clearly on our way to a society where the workers own the means of productions. That's what the elites want, it's their secret plan. They are tired of endless profits without them doing any work. They want to gift their factories to their workers, because they don't even care that much about being rich. It's horrible. If we don't pay close attention they will get through with their evil plan of distributing wealth fairly. That's like the one thing billionaires care about, fair distribution of wealth. I pray to Jesus, who was a capitalist, that we will be able to foil their satanic conspiracy.</p>

        <p>Communism isn't necessarily some sort of utopia where workers supposedly "own the means of production". Usually it's the <em>state</em> that ends up owning the means of production.</p>
<p>And I dunno, but to me, the state forcibly closing businesses sounds like a first step towards that. Megacorporations aren't going to be hit or affected by this. Instead, they will, in effect, become part of "the state".</p>
<p>This idea that communist white boys on reddit have where the "workers" own the means of production is a pipe dream.</p>
<p>You want to own your means of production? Start your own company or join a cooperative! These things are both possible under capitalism. Literally nothing is stopping you from starting your own factory and running it entirely by yourself. Of course, once you start expanding your workforce to increase output, suddenly you are now one of those "filthy leeches" that take away a big part of the value produced by the workers' labor.</p>

<p>Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha, poor incel.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, communism <em>is</em> when the means of production are owned by the state. If it's not owned by the state, it's anarcho-communism (which also has its fair share of problems).</p>

        <p>"Worker owned means of the production" is literally the most fundamental definition of socialism, which in this theory is the necessary prerequisite to establish communism. Yes, I know, but those countries that call or called themselves communist don't have that. That one is really hard to crack. Have you heard of the Democratic Republic of North Korea? You see, this idea that democratic white boys on reddit have where the "voters" control the political system is a pipe dream.</p>
<p>You see the problem here? Maybe... political actors are not always the most honest people? Maybe, just maybe, they sometimes act populistically, attaching themselves to labels they think will be positively affiliated by their people?</p>
<p>Socialism is a economic philosophy. It's core idea is that means of productions should be owned by the workers. Socialism is a necessary prerequisite for communism. If you are looking at a society where this is not the case, it's not a socialist or communist society, no matter what they call themselves, or what propaganda calls them. If you are looking at a society where capitalists own the means of production, that's capitalism. Simple as that. I guarantee you, there is no risk that the US will turn socialist any time soon. They won't even call themselves socialist, because in the US the word "socialism" is negatively associated by most people, so why would they. Don't worry, the world will stay the capitalistic hell hole we turned it into for a long time.</p>

        <p>I see that you have no idea what communism actually is, because you use that stupid line "workers own the means of production." In real communism, you know how it actually works when you apply it to real life, the "workers" are the government, who nationalize industry and destroy private enterprise. There's also an entire cultural aspect of communism, that is to say, the destruction of culture and tradition.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure that you understand the point. The government is increasing people's reliance on it and destroying small businesses in order to consolidate power in itself and in large corporations that work directly with the regime in power. What you want to look at is authoritarian regimes like Hitler, Mao, Stalin, etc. Where the government controls the industry and you'll see some striking similarities to the direction we are moving!</p>

        <p>Or maybe it's a stupid one. Communism isn't necessarily some sort of utopia where workers supposedly "own the means of production". Usually it's the <em>state</em> that ends up owning the means of production.</p>
<p>And I dunno, but to me, the state forcibly closing businesses sounds like a first step towards that. Megacorporations aren't going to be hit or affected by this, they will, in effect, become part of "the state".</p>

        <p>You're right. What we have today <em>isn't</em> communism, it's some sort of "worst of both worlds" hybrid.</p>
<p>That's why we have governments forcibly shutting down businesses, but at the same time not giving the business owners and the workers any compensation for that fact. Literally anything except what we have now would be an improvement.</p>

<p>I think a more correct anology would be taking a large tarp and making it a square shape but then real world wind kicks it up and deforms it so it no longer resembles a square and keeps changing forms as it folds over itself. It's no Kong the square you started with but an entirely new shape.</p>
<p>In theory communism seems like a nice idea, but due to human nature and the real world it would never work. Its the good old theory vs practical. It if you can't practically apply it, it doesn't work.</p>

<p>"All workers owning the means of production" is not physically achievable in our society. Most reddit communists end up advocating for measures that hurt the lower and middle classes and give even more power to giant corporations. That is, if they're not busy eating each other alive over stupid identity politics. Communists and trans activists are damn good at destroying each others' causes and communities and ensuring neither of them will ever get anything done.</p>
<p>Nice job ignoring my other comments by the way. Do you cherry pick all arguments like that?</p>
<p>You still haven't answered my other questions. What's stopping you from opening your own factory? Better yet, why not learn to code?
