        <p>That's the thing that really bothers me.</p>
<p>Nobody seems to know about timelines.</p>
<p>Nobody has a real grasp on <em>when</em> things will be safe.  </p>
<p>All this hysteria about wearing a mask and staying home rang hollow to me because of all of the essential workers I know and see around my area since the beginning of the year, and virtually no upswing in actual deaths.  </p>
<p>Now they just want us locked down or masked up, and for what?  Until when?  </p>
<p>A vaccine?  That's laughable.</p>
<p>Until it's "safe"?  What's the definition of "safe"?  Because "complete eradication" is never ever going to happen.</p>

        <p>There are always outliers and examples of complications, long-term or otherwise. That's nothing new or special and applies to other viruses/illnesses too. It would probably be more surprising if there were no such examples. The hyper focus on those outliers to instill ongoing fear in the people is criminal.</p>

        <p>Glad you’re well.  Not everyone is so fortunate.  </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, most people with pneumonia and influenza don’t develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).  The incidence of ARDS due to COVID19 is much higher, hence all of these critically ill patients on ventilators around the world.</p>
<p>Sequelae of ARDS is variable, but well known for long term complications.  So yes, data is still lacking as to the number of patients with long term complications due to COVID19.  However, the damage that many people have sustained in the days and weeks after their discharge is observable and demands continued follow up care.</p>
<p>I hope you’re right and that most people go on to have full recoveries.</p>

        <p>No, the prevalence of stories on the news claiming long term damage are implying it and you know it. And yes, any disease can cause long-term damage or complications. It’s a disease, and it affects everyone differently. Again, I’m not denying that it happens, but just because it might happen to some people doesn’t mean it’s something that happens widely. If you don’t think it happens widely then go to the posts on reddit where the covid alarmists are trying to justify the continued destruction of our society based on this spurious claim and make this argument that they don’t know whether or not it causes long-term damage. Until then, please leave. Goodbye!</p>

<p>Please show me which news articles are claiming that the majority of patients with COVID-19 develop organ damage. You're fabricating this claim because your actual position is ludicrous. </p>

<p>It is a common occurrence. But even if it wasn't, COVID-19 causes mortality and disease burdens in other ways. You're latching onto this one aspect of the disease, that nobody even believes, and acting as if that neutralizes the overall threat. </p>

<p>Pretty sure the virus that's killing hundreds of thousands of Americans is responsible for the destruction to our society. Not the reaction to it. People like you are why we are the only developed country on the planet that's still struggling with this. Y'all really needed to be hit more as kids, this entitlement you have is bananas.</p>

        <p>I feel like we’re arguing about the argument at this point. Anecdotally, I know several people who have pointed to news articles and then made a blanket claim that covid causes long-term lung damage, which hasn’t been proven by any robust, long-term study. The media is powerful, and when claims start circulating widely like this people don’t know how to contextualize it and read beyond the headline. My claim hasn’t been fabricated - search and you’ll find them. Some examples have even been shared in this sub and in coronavirus. </p>
<p>Yes it does cause mortality and disease burdens in other ways. I never denied this. But so does every disease. It’s important for us to question and understand claims made about the long-term disease burdens, because unlike influenza for example, we don’t have the benefit of decades of study and research. That’s why it’s damaging to make claims about long-term damage without <em>evidence.</em> Plenty of people believe it, or the claim that covid-19 causes long-term damage wouldn’t be circulating!</p>
<p>Honestly, if you equate questioning a public policy decision to selfishness and entitlement, you are part of the reason why politics in this country is so toxic.</p>

<p>So you have none. Great.</p>

<p>Now you're conflating your own argument. Originally you were against the claim that the <em>majority</em> of covid patients experienced long term damage (which nobody was saying). Now you're saying that the claim that it causes <em>any</em> long term damage is unproven? Which is it? Because we already have objective proof that it causes major organ damage. </p>
<p>&rt;Honestly, if you equate questioning a public policy decision to selfishness and entitlement, you are part of the reason why politics in this country is so toxic.</p>
<p>You're literally advocating for positions that are resulting in the loss of human life. Period. That is your position.</p>

        <p>I personally believe in a UBI but this is not the time for one. In a normal functioning society a better plan to keep people afloat then to let them lose everything seems to be a worthwhile goal. Caring about mental health but not treating EVERYTHING like one makes sense. People go through shit. Putting in a UBI NOW that EVERYONE would get just is gonna make the entire evening shut down. A UBI is not meant to keep the entire society afloat. It is meant to keep those who fall below a certain line in society afloat to let them quickly get back to contributing. Not the entire society...</p>

<p>Yeah I doubt that will work because welfare hasn't even returned any similar results</p>

        <p>True.  Welfare, like masks, were first said to be “temporary” to get support for them.  Now welfare is a lifestyle, like they want masks to be.  UBI is welfare.  Welfare doesn’t help people up.  It holds them down.</p>
