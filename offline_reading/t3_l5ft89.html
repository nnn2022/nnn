    <strong>To those who look to ban this group ...</strong>
    <p><p>I wrote this in response to a post but decided to turn this into a post.</p>
<p>Those who look to close this group should pay carefully attention.</p>
<p>People who are congruent in their beliefs and values have no need to quite others. Those who are incongruent do. If you feel a need to close this group and quiet the 100â€™s of voices here, you need to take some time for self reflection and ask yourself why? Why are you so eager to band other peoples right to speak?</p>
<p>Looking at the groups, the people, who want to close this group. From what I have seen, in your comments, your  thoughts are restricted and you are angry. Where does this anger stem from? If you are comfortable with what you believe, then you should have no need for such anger towards this group.</p>
<p>Could it be perhaps some of the stuff you are reading in this group is too thought provoking and making you question your beliefs and values!? Leaving you on shakey ground and questioning your actions so far?</p>
<p>A person who is comfortable with their values and beliefs systems as no need to restrict others.</p>
<p>I suggest time away from the media is needed so you can reconcile with your own inner values.</p>

        <p>I'm pro-mask, and i 100% don't agree with this sub,
But i really dont think any sub should be banned, unless they do something illegal, which this sub doesn't.</p>
