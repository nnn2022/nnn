<title>Trump: Flu season is coming up! Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu. Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!</title>

        <p>Maybe some states have, but I am in NY (obv) and this will make governors like Cuomo and Newsome close down harder and yell that Trump is murdering everyone and not following the science.</p>

        <p>&rt; I just found a whole subreddit full of deranged people right here. </p>
<p>Someone who goes to a post not for discussion but to insult people must be rather miserable. </p>
<p>&rt; COVID is real. </p>
<p>Ummmm... are you under the impression that I don’t think it is real? I’m not sure how you could get that impression - I’ve never disputed the existence of covid. Or are you just assuming?</p>
<p>&rt; Trump is an evil, lying fascist. </p>
<p>Okay. You are entitled to your opinion. I genuinely don’t care all that much about Trump one way or the other. </p>
<p>&rt; Believe in science. </p>
<p>I do, as do the many highly qualified scientists who oppose both lockdowns and mask mandates based on available evidence. </p>
<p>If you’re willing to share, I’d love to know what you think science is, or what it means to “believe” in it. </p>
<p>&rt; Fuck all of you anti-mask idiots.</p>
<p>What percentage of people who get infected with covid (regardless of whether they get tested - the true infection rate) die from it? </p>
<p>What’s the difference between an RCT, a lab simulation, and a retrospective study? Which provides the most compelling evidence, and why? </p>
<p>What hospitals were over capacity due to covid, and for how long?</p>

        <p>Yeah, but I think it will start to turn the tide of public opinion. The rabid doomer anti-Trumpers you see all over reddit represent such a miniscule portion of the general population. Normal people around the country are going to see the things Trump is saying about the virus and start to realize that maybe the media had vastly overblown it. And as long as public opinion changes, states and businesses are going to start reopening.</p>

        <p>A courageous nurse from Tampa--Erin Marie Olszewski--traveled to Brooklyn, NY to Elmhurst hospital to help with the crisis in April.  This was the "epicenter" of the "epicenter".</p>
<p>She documented how the cruel health workers were murdering patients with ventilators, do not resuscitate orders, and neglect.</p>
<p>I'm amazed and happy that Trump made this statement.  When people object to Trump's statement and cite the hell-scapes that occurred in NYC in April/May, they need to be directed to this video where Erin explains how they pulled that off:</p>

        <p>Can confirm, my mother-in-law and her sisters have a bad case of TDS. I don't much like any politician because the system itself is the real problem, so don't think this is coming from a Trump supporter, but I'm at the point of defending almost everything Trump says just to counteract the constant "oh my gawd" and "you've gotta be kidding me!" mother-in-law is always shouting across the house. Just....if you don't wanna hear it, lady, change the channel or turn off the TV. You have 3 different weather apps, you don't need to watch the news "for the weather" if you're gonna stay for the RiSiNg CaSeS or Trump's latest tweet.</p>

        <p>I have friends who have TDS so bad they constantly post insults on social media, especially when there's an election coming up.  And they are staunchly anti-lockdown, and they <em>know</em> Biden wants to lock us down, but they're still going to vote for him because they hate Trump that much.  I can't wrap my head around voting for someone who will further destroy the economy and your mental health with lockdowns, rather than someone whom you dislike but can deal with for another four years.</p>

        <p>Both my parents have mentioned wanting to vote this year. My mom want to vote for Trump because "he's a dick and that's what this country needs" while my dad wants to vote for Biden because he doesn't like Trump. NOT because he likes Biden, he made that clear. He just hates Trump more. Then my mother-in-law denies voting at all last time, except she slipped up once and admitted to voting for Hillary. She denies it any other time though, because she knows my husband and I don't like her or Biden, but she also thinks we're way more pro-Trump than we really are. No, we just hate him less than the others. It's all a big fucking mess lol</p>

        <p>Almost everyone I know has rabid TDS, and get this... they’re Canadian. They don’t care one iota about the terrible things that their own Prime Minister has done, they don’t even mention it, but literally anything to do with Trump and they’re hysterical about it. </p>
<p>One of my family members stopped talking to me because I posted something about the hypocrisy of people shouting about saving people’s lives yet wishing death on the president.  I haven’t posted anything else about Trump ever, just this one thing highlighting the hypocrisy of it, so this person doesn’t actually even know what my political opinions are.  </p>
<p>And the irony? This family member responded to my post saying “it doesn’t matter if Trump dies because hashtag BLM”. Again, let’s remember it was Trudeau who got caught wearing black face MULTIPLE times, but ok racism is Trump’s fault. Lol.</p>

        <p>I've said this for a while. I don't like Trump, but where is the awful, authoritarian dictator that everyone promised he would be in 2016? Locking us all down for an indefinite amount of time and implementing martial law to ensure that no one leaves their house would be a perfect opportunity for a dictator to grab power. </p>
<p>I can guarantee that if Trump had come out in March and said "I'm implementing a national stay at home order to keep the American people safe. You can only go out for essentials and when you do, you have to wear a mask. If you disobey, you will be arrested" then people would have been freaking out that their "Trump is the second coming of Hitler" predictions finally came true. They would protest over such orders being unconstitutional. The media would print headlines such as "Fascism has arrived in America" and "Trump overeggarrates the coronavirus response". The SJWs on here and Twitter would cry over how lockdowns disproportionately affect people of color, women, and the poor. They would also point out that lockdowns further separate the wage gap because the rich are getting richer and only the cushy WFH jobs held by privileged middle class people are safe (for now). They would virtue signal about how mental health, suicides, addiction, homelessness, domestic violence, and unemployment skyrocketing. If Trump had done anything that Cuomo and Newsom have gotten away with, I guarantee that this would not have lasted 6 months.</p>

<p>&rt;Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza</p>
<p>It would do nothing. The lockdowns did nothing but destroy our way of life. We have never shut down or mandated masks for flu seasons and I don't see why we should now.</p>

        <p>But, he's not lying about flu deaths.  Remember, Trump is 74.  He lived through the Hong Kong Flu epidemic of 1968, where there <em>were</em> 100k deaths due to the flu.  </p>
<p>Also, please bear in mind that one must also adjust for population growth when comparing excess deaths in the past.</p>
<p>Edit.  For those reading this--I goofed and added a column I shouldn't have.  Please disregard this:</p>
<p>&rt; Also, in the US we had almost 100k deaths 2001-2002 due to H1N1.  See Table 2 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5933a1.htm">here</a>.  There were also close to 100k deaths 2005-2006 (H3N2).</p>

        <p>Both of those were novel viruses much like covid-19 is, not the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Edit: did you read what you linked?</p>
<p>&rt;During the past three decades, the estimated number of annual influenza-associated deaths from respiratory and circulatory causes ranged from a low of 3,349 to a high of 48,614 deaths.</p>
<p>Is 48k deaths close to 100k?</p>

        <p>I said, see table 2.  </p>
<p>Table 2 counts flu deaths with comorbidities.  The majority of COVID deaths in the US have comorbidities, so Table 2 is likely closer to the way we count COVID deaths right now.</p>
<p>&rt; They weren't season influenza, they were a novel influenza virus (new, never before seen) much like covid-19 is a novel coronavirus. </p>
<p>Which should go to show, there have always been "novel" viruses.  There probably always will be.  No economy can survive indefinite rolling shutdowns.</p>

        <p>We don't count flu deaths the same way as we do Rona deaths, though. Flu deaths are usually an estimation obtained with a calculation involving the number of hospitalizations and deaths in a given year, not by feverishly testing motorcycle crashes, gunshot victims, and everyone else that comes through the hospital doors with a failing pulse. The numbers can't be compared as they are.</p>

        <p>I didn’t compare flu deaths to covid deaths. The numbers that I and Trump cited are exclusively flu numbers. These numbers are flu deaths from previous years, before covid even existed, so it’s irrelevant to what I said.</p>

        <p>I, in no way, support Trump, but I fail to see how any of this is misleading or potentially harmful. It's legitimate policy option for responding to a virus - if I'm not mistaken it was essentially the US's former official pandemic response plan for viruses with similar fatalities to this one.  It's disturbing to me that stating this position is labeled as misinformation.</p>

        <p>Yes, Dr Tedros declared in a speech in Feb that there wasn't just a pandemic but an "infodemic", i.e. a proliferation of "misinformation" on covid. And he promptly pressured governments, health authorities, media and tech companies to agree to go on a massive censorship offensive.</p>
<p>But all along one must beg the question, who was deciding what was true and what was false, what was legitimate and what was "misleading", what was sound advice vs "potentially harmful"....?</p>

        <p>I think you're spot on -- that's a great article.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/munich-security-conference">same speech</a> from 15 Feb where Tedros introduced the term "infodemic", he went on to state:</p>
<p>&rt;We’re encouraged that an international team of experts is now on the  ground in China, working closely with their Chinese counterparts to  understand the outbreak, and to <strong>inform the next steps in the global  response</strong>.</p>
<p>He also spoke of the WHO's coordinated efforts with social media companies to combat "misinformation" and "rumours" -- which had the perverse effect of allowing Chinese propaganda to widely disseminate while squashing genuine political debate and scientific enquiry.</p>

        <p>That is a good point. It looks like there were over 100k US influenza deaths in 1957 and 1967 each (and way more in 1918), so what he said is technically true, although perhaps misleading to imply it is frequent/recent. It would be helpful if Twitter pointed out what was incorrect about what they flag (maybe they do, somehow..don't read Twitter much). In the realm of Trump accuracy though, and even a lot of MSM headlines, I think this tweet is overall fairly truthy.</p>

<p>And related to what you said, did you know that the current seasonal flu is a mutation of the flu that caused the 1918 global pandemic? So yes, it’s probably true that Covid will not be as serious in years to come as it is now (i.e., 2020 will be an outlier).</p>

        <p>There’s a problem with the common assertion that the hundreds of thousands of US deaths are being misclassified as resulting from COVID: excess deaths. Total deaths in the US for 2020 significantly exceed the usual trend.</p>
<p><a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/09/01/comorbidities-and-coronavirus-deaths-cdc/">We can observe trends from the number of deaths reported each year, on a weekly basis. When we see large deviations in the numbers for a time period, we call that excess deaths. Looking at 2020 since March, the raw number of excess deaths is 200,000 more people than a normal year. When we try to understand that, COVID-19 is the most rational and likely explanation. If you don't believe it's COVID-19, try to pinpoint why this year has been so different than any other. Why would a new disease that kills people not be the cause?</a></p>

        <p>When it’s a disease that is over-tested as much as it is, than yes, it is very believable. Lockdowns is a very new thing too, and people had very human reactions to it — like suicide, being afraid to go to the hospital for treatment, etc.</p>
<p>Suicides are up to a ridiculous degree this year, as are ODs. And it’s a verifiable fact that many hospitals canceled elective treatments, many of which were for preventative and life-saving procedures.</p>
<p>I think there’s a better argument that we’ve significantly over-counted the actual Covid deaths. There are reports that we over-vented unnecessarily in hospitals, which caused a high death rate. Can those deaths really be covid deaths if it was due to medical malpractice? What about the practice of some places to attribute every person who dies within 30 days of a covid positive test (in some places, no matter how long after the positive test) to be a covid death, even if the cause of death was a car crash? Or how about the fact that hospitals had a financial incentive to attribute deaths to covid, and that there are many families of people who have died fighting to take covid off the death certificate because their family member was already dying of cancer or something?</p>

<p>I think it's most likely to be a combination of both that is almost impossible to disentangled right now, especially given the really diverse standards of counting COVID deaths across the world.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not saying you're entirely wrong, but if that was what was really happening it would be abundantly obvious.</p>
<p>It is abundantly obvious to anyone actually looking.  "Deaths of despair" is a real, documented, scientifically validated phenomenon.  </p>
<p>And weren't people warning about the dangers of overloaded health care systems back when the message was "flatten the curve"?  Why was that?  Because people might be denied access to much needed health care.  So, now we've denied people access to much needed health care, but that's suddenly acceptable because it was done by government decree?  Those harms of denied health services still exist.</p>

<p>Edit: never mind. If the excess deaths were attributable to lockdowns, then there shouldn’t be excess deaths for 2020 in Sweden, which didn’t have a lockdown. Problem is, <a href="https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/">they did</a>.</p>

<p>Wow, the more interesting thing there is how many countries barely have a noticeable "z-score" at all.  The ones that do are generally those with the very strict lockdowns (Spain, UK, France, Italy).  Not sure how Switzerland, Netherlands, Belgium fit on the "strictness" metric. Other than that, there's really nothing noticeable.  </p>
<p>In that sense, Sweden is an exception in having a noticeable z-score, but it is smaller than the one for the countries with strict lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Not all the deaths are attributable to lockdowns, no.  Nobody is saying that.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Sweden had some unusually high mortality this year.  But, it was only unusual in the context of our extreme recent success in extending lifespans and fighting off known viruses like the flu so effectively.</p>
<p>In the context of history?  Not so much.  And certainly not unusually dangerous enough to justify an extreme response.</p>

        <p>I agree there will be excess deaths attributed to the lockdown, which one of the reasons I am anti-lockdown.  However, I don't think they are really included in the tally of COVID deaths, which tend to be the very old and infirm.</p>

        <p>But it indicates a deeper analysis is needed. If we take out NY and NJ, which had a ton of early deaths when they didn't know how to treat COVID properly, how do excess deaths look? We can't forever treat this as if it was new.</p>

        <p>Maybe not, but it's not very scientific to say "why wouldn't excess deaths be attributed to the new virus?", while completely disregarding the insurrection, now is it?</p>
<p>Homicide is up 28% NATIONWIDE compared to last year. Take the top 27 cities between June and August and it's up 53%.</p>

        <p>&rt;And I’m open to any credible sources saying that lockdowns are ineffective at fighting COVID deaths</p>
<p>I'd start with a review of Sweden's experience which I summarize <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/j5xn5w/trump_health_official_meets_with_doctors_pushing/g7w8bwv/">here</a>.  Frankly, it seems to me a fairly trivial observation to recognize that lockdowns, even if they do provide <em>some</em> marginal benefit in the form of reduced COVID deaths, clearly can't justify their <em>staggering</em> costs.  </p>
<p>From a post titled: <a href="https://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2018/06/whats-value-of-qaly.html">"What's the Value of a QALY?"</a></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Typical value benchmarks in the United States have historically ranged from approximately $50 000 to, more recently, as high as approximately $150 000 per QALY.</strong> Those benchmarks purport to represent the “value” of a QALY; ie, the “willingness to pay” to gain 1 QALY of health. The benchmark could also be conceived as a measure of opportunity cost in terms of the health outcomes of the marginal intervention that must be relinquished to provide resources for a new intervention. Interventions with lower cost-effectiveness ratios below the benchmark are said to have favorable value because they “buy” QALYs relatively inexpensively; ie, at a cost below the value indicated by the benchmark. Interventions with higher ratios “buy” QALYs expensively and hence have unfavorable value. The United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which is charged with assessing health technology value for that country’s National Health Service, has used more stringent benchmarks. With a number of exceptions, <strong>favorable value has generally corresponded to cost-effectiveness ratios below £20 000 (about $28 000) per QALY, and unfavorable value has generally corresponded to ratios exceeding £30 000 (about $42 000) per QALY.</strong></p>
<p>Assume that the US would have seen an additional 500,000 COVID-19 deaths without lockdowns (an <em>absurdly</em> high and unrealistic estimate for which there's zero evidence), and further assume that each of those 500,000 "saved" lives will get to enjoy, on average, an additional 10 quality-adjusted life years (another estimate that is absurdly high given the age and health status of most COVID-19 deaths).  </p>
<p>Finally, if we use the very high end estimate of $150,000 / QALY, all of those absurdly pro-lockdown estimates together imply that US lockdowns provided a $750 billion benefit.  But their <em>costs</em> have clearly been in the <em>trillions</em>. </p>
<p>Let's do another estimate with numbers that I think are still quite generous but at least in the realm of potentially plausible.  If we assume that lockdowns resulted in 75,000 fewer US deaths, each of those on average getting to enjoy an additional 5 quality-adjusted life years, and we use $100,000 as the "value" (i.e., opportunity cost proxy) for a QALY, that would give us a benefit of $37.5 billion.  The combined costs of our response are obviously <em>so</em> much greater than that it's not even funny!</p>

        <p>I'm open to credible sources that prove lockdowns <em>are</em> effective at more than simply delaying the inevitable.  The burden of proof is on those imposing the policy.</p>
<p>And I do not blame the lockdowns on whatever the Deep State is, personally.  I blame them on blanket mitigations where targeted mitigations would have been far more effective and less economically destructive.</p>

        <p>Sweden's main death toll came from a point of failure to protect its care facility residents--for which in Sweden the average life expectancy is 6 months.  They freely admit that.  Targeted mitigations--surrounding care facilities with testing/PPE/hazard pay and accommodations for workers--would have fixed this.  Locking down the entire population?  Unnecessary.</p>
<p>Edit:  Also there are countries in South America that locked down much harder than the US, are still in lockdown, and have high death tolls per million population.</p>

        <p>Well the definition of a fascist is someone who supports authoritarianism, forcible suppression of dissent, forcible closures of businesses you don’t like, etc.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Trump is doing none of those things. You would expect it, because we’ve been told over and over again how Trump is an evil dictator. Now Trump sucks, but is by definition not a fascist.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Newsom is over here being extremely authoritarian, is forcibly suppressing dissenting opinions, and keeping businesses closed because he decided they should be.</p>
<p>Who is the fascist again?</p>

        <p>Oh wow, you're serious.</p>
<p>Here are the two biggest indicators that he isn't a fascist - that people are free to mock, berate, criticize, and openly oppose him without getting disappeared or otherwise forcibly silenced.  The other is that <em>he could get voted out of power</em>.  Not exactly the hallmarks of a fascist dictator.</p>
<p>Not to mention that if he actually were a fascist, now would literally be the perfect  time to seize power and impose his will on people, much like we're seeing in blue states.</p>

        <p>I didn’t say Trump is a fascist dictator, I just said he is a fascist. I’m not calling the American government fascist, just one man sitting in one of its many offices. 
Trump is trying to forcibly silence is opposition by trying to have ANTIFA categorized as a terrorist organization when ANTIFA isn’t an organization at all, but an ideology. Because of this, if ANTIFA were to be labeled as a terrorist organization, anyone with left leaning predications could be considered ANTIFA, and any left wing protest could be labeled as an ANTIFA protest. But thankfully our FBI isn’t run fascists.
Trump has also said he might not accept a peaceful transition of power, so again, another indicator he’s a fascist. </p>

        <p>— Praising bad people doesn’t make you a fascist, it makes you a bad person. </p>
<p>— politicians, even “good” politicians, do shitty things with sketchy world players because it benefits us politically and economically. Again, not a fascist thing. A bad thing surely. Even unethical and problematic — not fascist.</p>
<p>— ending medical protections isn’t great but it’s different from banning people from getting transgender surgery. The former is just bad, the latter is fascism</p>
<p>— again, this is a bad thing, but not fascist. Do you genuinely think that Trump’s life would have been safe had he let the protestors do their thing so he could score political points? Of course he shouldn’t have gone in the first place, but if he’s going, you better believe that the people around him are going to protect him. And it’s not like he gassed the people surrounding the White House and protesting every day. For the most part, that was done peacefully and without a problem. He only did so when his life was at stake.</p>
<p>— Stephen Miller being called a white nationalist is actually a media libel. Did you know he’s jewish? Like a member of an oppressed people? Sure, jews aren’t one of the cool oppressed people like blacks or indigenous people. But he’s not a “white nationalist”. He may have bad, even evil immigration ideas, but making him out to be the devil is again not the whole story. Spoiler: he’s not. There is zero nuance in that assessment of him.  </p>
<p>It bothers me that I feel like I have to defend Trump, because I despise him. But words matter. If this whole pandemic response thing has taught us anything, it’s that words have actual real life consequences. Calling Trump a fascist is just incorrect. At a time when we need to overthrow the actual fascists in this country who have consolidated power in a way that is undoubtably awful (think Whitmer, Cuomo, Newsom), pitting Trump in that category is idiotic. Is he a horrible person? Yes. Fascist? No, just no.</p>

        <p>Putin and Erdogan just bad people though, they are fascists themselves. There’s nothing peaceful about gassing people for a photo op. Calling Stephen Miller a white nationalist was not media libel, it was the correct extrapolation from the views expressed in his leaked emails. Him being Jewish does not matter, there were Jews that served under Hitler, and Nazi Germany recognized “honorary Aryans”. </p>

        <p>Not a Trump supporter but this needs to stop. Trump is not a fascist - he is an ineffective, corrupt, do-nothing president who occasionally rhetorically panders to nationalists. If he were a fascist COVID would provide him all the cover he needed to show it. It is hyperbolic and absurd to keep calling him a fascist at this point. Words have meanings! It's so easy to come up with reality based substantial critiques of the guy - he is irresponsible with his platform, has increased the wealth gap, risked war to assassinate a foreign leader without congressional oversight, failed to achieve or seemingly even attempt to achieve stated policy goals like building the wall, has embraced "the swamp", etc. Drop the hyperbolic fascist nonsense and Russian conspiracy theories and start talking about how he's fucked over the working people of this country. You all sound ridiculous and it won't surprise me at all to watch democrats snap defeat from the Jaws of victory yet again. It disturbs me to see the opposition's inability to come up with substantial criticisms of or alternatives to Trump's actual policies.  All you guys have are labels and smears. It's tiring.</p>

        <p>How so? What exactly has Trump done in 2020 that is "fascist"? He's basically told states...do whatever you think is appropriate, which is exactly what the federal government is supposed to do. There's a lot of more evidence of fascism coming from governors like Newsom, Cuomo and Whitmer.</p>
<p>Fascism implicates using dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society, which is exactly what these governors are doing via emergency orders.</p>

        <p>ok, with the obligatory, i give no fucks about trump, any politician or politics in general, as politics is only legal plunder and death, i will comment on this:</p>
<p>&rt; ...we have learned to live with it (flu), just like we are learning to live with Covid</p>
<p>living with the flu is far different in reality than 'learning to live with covid'</p>
<p>learning to 'live with with covid' means masks, anti-social distancing, no 'social' gathering', small business closed en masse and heavily restricted, etc., and all by DICTATE</p>
<p>this is 'learning to live with covid' </p>
<p>i say fuck that 'learning to live with covid' shit.</p>
<p>trump must call for, nay demand an immediate end to all of it. if the local tyrants can dictate these 'learning  measures', then trump can dictate for them to cease and desist.</p>
<p>fauci ' the only way we ever return to normal is with 'government heath measures'</p>

        <p>When you already have money and power, the next thing you start to seek is control. Control over other people is the ultimate thing that many of these psychopaths chase.  Not only that, this new control grid they are building for us cements their position, they control everything the masses see, where they go and who they fraternise with. It makes it virtually impossible for any political uprising to ever happen again if their plan comes to fruition.  Look how easily the majority of people have already been brainwashed with propaganda, walking around in masks.  We have already seen that the public seems to be fine with control over what kind of protests are 'allowed' as well. </p>
<p>If you don't believe it, look at the Biden slogan 'build back better'. It is used by the WEF, it is used by the UN, it is used by Boris Johnson in the UK.  Why suddenly is this phrase appearing everywhere?  There is even a website about the 'great reset' now - it's so transparent that it isn't even hidden or a conspiracy, it's in plain daylight:</p>
<p>https://greatreset.com/</p>
<p>This is the same 'great reset' the WEF (look up Charles Schwab) talk about and whilst it is dressed up in flowery feel good language, it ultimately boils down to more control for the elites and massive restrictions for everyone else.  Why should a public health crisis be in anyway linked to climate, equality or social issues? What is so special about covid that means we need to change the entire fabric of society forever?  The first paragraph even implies that climate 'lockdowns' might become a thing in order to reduce emissions.  The more I research this stuff, the more this feels like a plan that has been in the making for an extremely long time, not just incompetence.  If anyone had said this stuff to me in February this year, I'd have thought they were crazy, but I'm open minded and there is plenty of evidence of a much bigger agenda at play here than just a pandemic that is being handled incompetently.</p>

        <p>Trump won't do anything to stop lockdowns. He does not care. He's using this as an election issue, but if he is re-elected, he won't do shit either. He hasn't done shit for 7 months. He wants others to take the heat, because he has no responsibility. He's a weak-ass excuse for a leader.</p>

        <p>I think you mean no politician is a particularly good person and I would agree with that, however the reason I like trump is because he never was a politician and he had more to lose than to gain by taking the position.</p>

        <p>As from opposing camp, I feel so confused. Cuz obv the direction he is pushing with this I’d support, but it comes not from a right place and the way he does it - makes angry people angrier.. which does not help and will make a lot of people get even less bearable... but fuuuuck.. part of me is so happy to hear at least Trump say this.</p>

        <p>US flu deaths have ranged between 12,000 and 61,000 over the last ten years. The 61k year of 2017/18 was the highest death toll for around 40 years.</p>
<p>Those 61k deaths came from around 45,000,000 infections in total. That's a death rate of 0.136%. COVID-19 has a death rate of ~0.5%, nearly 4x that of the worst flu in 40 years. COVID-19 is also more infectious than influenza, meaning that if left uncontained it will reach and infect a significantly higher proportion of the population.</p>
<p>The higher lethality and higher infectivity are just two of the reasons why equating this pandemic to seasonal flu is a foolish thing to do.</p>

        <p>And the flu kills more children each year than covid does yet have you ever once wanted to close schools for the flu?  Hmm?  Don't children matter?  Or do you just not care?  </p>
<p>UK released a study estimating that lock downs will cause up to 75,000 deaths.  Know how many have died in UK to covid?  about 40,000.  So... once again, this covid response shows a complete hatred of human life.  So no, covid is nothing.  I officially no longer care about covid deaths.</p>

        <p>They aren't, 0.5% is an absurd estimate of the IFR and is not corroborated by the vast majority of studies.  The WHO estimates 750 million have been infected with covid which gives an IFR of 0.13% and that is with a death count which is vastly exaggerated due to the way they are counted in most western countries. The flu is much more dangerous to young people and children than covid.  If we counted flu deaths the same way, flu would kill an enormous amount of people each year, but we don't.</p>
