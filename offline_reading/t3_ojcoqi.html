    <strong>Things are getting weirder post G7 summit, my theory...</strong>
    <p><p>SO, you all know the G7 summit happened recently, we all saw the pictures. here is a quote from the website.</p>
<p>"Prime Minister Boris Johnson brought the world’s leading democracies together to reach major new agreements to help the world fight, and then build back better from coronavirus and create a greener, more prosperous future.</p>
<p>Let's focus on Boris, Biden, Merkel, Macron and Trudeau.</p>
<p>After meeting to come to an "agreement" on how to best fight the virus, it seems that instead of forming any solid plan at all, a single plan which all of the represented nations would surely follow in order to end the pandemic, each nation involved has now decided to suddenly switch it up, and take varying polarising stances...</p>
<p>Biden and USA is going door to door and according to the Media is "running out of ideas" lol</p>
<p>Boris and the UK went from warning that lockdown will never end, to now saying fuck it, everything can open and it's on YOU to protect yourself.</p>
<p>Merkel and Germany aren't really doing anything, it is still masks required indoors and there is barely any societal pressure to be vaccinated here and things are changing slowly.</p>
<p>Macron and France have now gone full-on removal of freedom without a vaccine.</p>
<p>Trudeau and Canada are banning un-vaxxed tourists and discriminating against the un-vaxxed.</p>
<p>So what exact plan did they come up with? What was the real purpose of the G7? To me it seems as if there is no plan, It's a theatre. Or, the plan is far more sinister. This whole situation is looking more and more like one giant experiment and the leaders of each nation either have no idea what's going on, or this is one giant deep state experiment on the populations of each nation.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p></p>

        <p>What’s your budget? Ok don’t answer that publicly or at all but anyway if it’s enough and/or you can work remotely, I can show you the way in South America. Plan to move there soon. A select few countries are rather based and cheap and amazingly beautiful women and fun and open and beautiful</p>

        <p>I didnt think about it, but this being one giant experiment is deffinitely food for thought now. Like each country is doing something different to see how the people will react and after some time they will compare the results and all of them choose the most “succesful“ approach?</p>

        <p>I'm afraid these ppl aren't as smart as everyone might think they are otherwise they wouldn't be politicians. Politicians today may appear "smart" but don't equate intelligence with wiliness. </p>
<p>ultimately nothing came of the G8 because nothing ever comes from these wank fests. think about all the climate accords and UN conferences. what changes when these bureaucrats come together? NOTHING.</p>
<p>ultimately, govts, especially western democratic govts, do not have enough time nor clout to implement any ground breaking change. they operate in a giant political machine, mostly ineffective and inefficient.</p>
<p>all political "leaders" are now just flinging shit at the walls and seeing what sticks. if something kind of looks like it works for one, and it gets enough msm coverage, others might try it out. Notice how there is a limited pool of responses and not one of the G8 or G20 are operating outside of the status quo?</p>
<p>think about it;</p>
<ul>
<li>all of them said 2 weeks to flatten the curve,</li>
<li>all of them used lockdowns and facemask mandates,</li>
<li>all of them said they were going to buy up vaccines when ready,</li>
<li>all of them have used heavy handed approaches to roll out the vaccine but none have mandated it outright,</li>
<li>all of them are now requiring the mandatory vaccination of health care workers,</li>
<li>all of them are discussing vaccine passports,</li>
<li>all of them printed huge amounts of money to paper over all of the economic cracks appearing between nov 2019 and mar 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>see the pattern here? there's no agenda. politicians, health officials, economists, banks...they are all just as clueless as each other and they all act in exactly the same way? Name a G8 or even G20 govt who has done something novel?</p>
<p>What you are witnessing is the political process laid bare; it is a bunch of clueless morons floundering around trying to function is a very rigid institutional structure with the bottom feeders; big pharma, big tech, big msm, big banks, circling around, using their lobbyists to profiteer from chaos.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the majority of humanity have bought the rhetoric. Countries such as France, the UK, Australia and Canada should give us a fair indication that politicians aren't even trying to hide their contempt for their constituents any more.</p>

        <p>Maybe they were deciding which way was the best way to move forward, they all took a different method each (from a pot?) and will see which method works the best.</p>
<p>By saying 'works the best' I mean totally subjugates it's population the first.</p>

        <p>I think these are divide and conquer tactics that are designed to spread confusion and fear, making the population easier to control.</p>
<p>The lack of clarity and logic just adds to the insecurity of not knowing what our so called leaders will have in store for us next.</p>
<p>The one thing I'm fairly confident on is that whatever they are rolling out, it's usually not good for the people and should be thoroughly questioned rather than blindly followed.</p>
