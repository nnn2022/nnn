        <p>&rt;What the people have endured over the past fifteen months—to borrow a phrase from United States District Judge Justin R. Walker—“<strong><em>is something this Court never expected to see outside the pages of a dystopian novel.</em></strong>” </p>
<p>Uh, yeah, no shit! We've been saying this since the beginning. What is that word the media, the pro-lockdown people and their collaborators like to use to call us "crazy" people? Oh, right, "conspiracy theorists" who simply just don't want to follow The Science^(TM).</p>
<p>&rt;Yet, Defendants contend that the Governor’s rule by mere emergency decree must continue indefinitely, and independent of legislative limits. </p>
<p>You would think this is something out of a science fiction novel or movie like V for Vendetta! The nonsense here is that the government wanted to rule by decree (see California, NY, MI, etc.), and think there are no limits and think every one would go along with it. The government would say, "jump" and the citizenry would gladly shout and ask, "how high?"</p>
<p>&rt;In effect, Defendants seek declaratory judgment that  the Constitution provides this broad power so long as he utters the word, “emergency.” It does not. </p>
<p>I love this judge already. He effectively told these cunts the constitution isn't just a document you step because you utter the words "emergency" and that's the problem. You have States like NY, NJ, MI, CA, etc., that think you utter the word "emergency" that all of a sudden they think they're King or Queen Farooq.</p>
<p>&rt;For this Court to accept Defendant’s position would not be honoring its oath to support the Constitution; <strong><em>it would be tantamount to a coup d’état against it</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, this judges get it. I like that the judge told them straight out, you are violating your oath of office in which WE THE PEOPLE entrusted you to enforce, and not violate. This judge is on to something, they hit the nail right on the head, anything else other then the enforcement of the constitution (including our rights previously guaranteed) is a direct usurpation of the constitution and is a coup. Too bad the judge didn't order the arrest and prosecution of these un-constitutional bigots and their collaborators for openly violating the rights of the people, and their oaths.</p>
