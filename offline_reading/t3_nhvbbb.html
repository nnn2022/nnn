    <strong>Vaccines and transmission</strong>
    <p><p>So for the longest time, everyone was saying that the jab did not prevent anyone from spreading it.  Now I am starting to see articles saying otherwise.  Wat?  I looked into several of them, and a lot of them have no citations sourcing where this information comes from with regard to vaccines now preventing transmission - they just say it prevents it.</p>
<p>I saw one article that cited a study, but the study said the results were still mixed, and that it was only SYMPTIMATIC transmission because those with the vaccines do not get sick.  Isn't asymptomatic transmission a thing, or is that out now too?</p>
<p>I guess I don't really know what to believe anymore.  Has there been actual evidence showing that this jab really does stop transmission?  If that is the case, then I guess I could see potential value in it, but if not, then I still simply do not get it.</p></p>
