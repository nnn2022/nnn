    <strong>Trump's positive take on Covid is going to sway voters to his side</strong>
    <p><p>I personally think that the people will be more enticed by Trump's view than Biden's fear mongering.</p></p>

        <p>He already has my vote. I didn't like the guy in 2016 and I admit I still don't, but my vote is for whoever gets the US open again.</p>
<p>There are certain matters I really do disagree with Republicans on (abortion, for example), but for me, my vote is based on this single issue alone.</p>
<p>I live in NJ, so you can imagine how fucking tired I am.</p>

        <p>Yea that's a reason I think trump will win 
Despite what the MSM and r/coronavirus thinks</p>
<p>I truely belive more people are sick of the lockdowns, sick of online learning, sick of being poor, sick of being Forced to wear masks (biden has also hinted at mandatory vaccines) and more people don't wanna take the vaccine then do </p>
<p>I don't belive in saviours in governmouts but id put more hopes in trump then biden to stop the tyrannical takeover</p>

        <p>Plus the left has made it impossible for anyone to speak out against masks or restrictions without being screamed at or threatened. So they've made it impossible for themselves to even asses what public opinion even is. When they shut down debate, it makes it that much harder to know where public opinion stands which, in turn, makes it harder for them to know how to run their campaigns.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure it's banned on any subreddit except for the few safe spaces. Even unpopularopinion is only full of "Unpopular Opinion: Wear a mask"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Some people here dont even mind being asked to wear a mask by store employees, I just want a place to say, "wait why are we all circlejerking each other over how good little boys we are for wearing a stupid mask?" or "Guys isn't 9 months a little too far to still be obsessed about covid?" and hate being called a selfish asshole because "dude, someone's grandma died. We need to keep everything closed until at least next July. Wear your fucking mask you abysmal human being."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>~~Some~~ Most of these people are losers who just want a excuse to use a naughty word.</p>

        <p>I remember when unpopular opinion was full of the refugees from other subs complaining about the lockdowns and being against them. Hell, it was that sub which introduced me to r/lockdownskepticism, which in turn introduced me to r/coronaviruscirclejerk, and that sub led me here.</p>
<p>How far it has fallen. The CCP truly are trying to dominate all of Reddit and censor all alternative viewpoints.</p>

        <p>That could be true. Outside of coastal metro areas a lot if the country DGAF about all this as much. The media and social media has made not living in fear something people are not open about. But they may be very open about it in the ballot box. It’s hard to tell we’ll have to see.</p>

        <p>Well, anecdotally (I admit), almost everyone that I know and saw (including myself) has been wearing a mask, be it in shops, public transport, restaurants while walking to their tables. As far as I know it's legally enforceable, but worse than that, you'll be shamed and labelled if you don't comply.</p>
<p>Yet the virus has continued to spread regardless and a new lockdown has been imposed yet again.</p>

        <p>No-one knows how effective masks even are at preventing spread. It's an easy -visual- way to demonize others that don't share the same world view as you do. Kinda like wearing an anti-vax statement on your sleeve.  CDC even says physical distancing/washing hands are many times more effective.</p>

        <p>&rt;Why are most health officials pushing masks and social distancing?</p>
<p>Three main factors at play that I can see:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They're taking a myopic and short-termist view. The question is how to reduce cases, so the answer is obviously to reduce human contact as much as possible. Little to no consideration has been given to the massive harms and suffering that these measures are causing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's now become a politically and socially unacceptable view to be against lockdowns and social distancing, largely because of media sensationalism and fear-mongering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tremendous amount of scientists that actually are anti-lockdown/anti-social distancing and anti-masks, and brave enough to speak up about it are either ignored, cancelled, or vilified by the media.</p>
</li>

<li>Obviously, it is a stop gap until a vaccine is available.  According to a recent Columbia study, 130,000 deaths could have been avoided if people had worn masks.</li>
<li>It shouldn't be a political issue, it is a matter of public health.  You have an idiot in the White House contradicting his own health officials because he feels uncomfortable wearing a mask.</li>

<p>It's highly likely that we'll never develop a suitable vaccine that can eliminate the threat of this virus.</p>
<p>&rt;According to a recent Columbia study, 130,000 deaths could have been avoided if people had worn masks.</p>
<p>Almost all these modelling based studies we've seen so far have been conclusively and consistently wrong since the beginning of this pandemic.</p>
<p>&rt;It shouldn't be a political issue, it is a matter of public health. You have an idiot in the White House contradicting his own health officials because he feels uncomfortable wearing a mask.</p>
<p>I'm not in the US. I'm Irish, and that's where I live. I happen to think that Trump is possibly the most narcissistic, least intelligent and selfish leaders the world has ever seen, yet on this topic he's absolutely right. And this is a topic of such grave importance that if I could I'd actually be prepared to vote for him of Biden, who has said he'd support further lockdowns.</p>

        <p>So the science says they dont work, but they throw in "we still recommend it" pretty much because they have to so it doesn't get forced taken down, and you disregard the ACTUAL science and go see they said still wear one🤦‍♂️</p>
<p>Is the influenza virus so much smaller in size your face diaper works for coronacircus but not influenza?   Wow thats amazing.  Doesnt matter when it came out, the science with masks and respiratory viruses has always been the same.  I mean I realize people like you think its some smart virus( infects at anti lockdown rallies but not blm riots, will at the shop down the road with 4 people in it but not wallyworld with hundreds, etc etc) and with covid suddenly everything changed how respiratory viruses work and trasmit.  Amazing smart virus.</p>

        <p>Yeah no... you can just stop making yourself look dumber than you probably are.  No 200000 have not died.  Do you know how they classify covid deaths?  What tests do they use? </p>
<p>Based off your attempts here, you literally know nothing but your favorite talking points ramned into your skull 24/7.  Do I need to show you Birx saying how they classify a covid death?  How about the Illinois dpt of health director?   How about Dr and state senator from MN?</p>
<p>Ps- our govt reauthorized domestic use of propaganda with the smith-mundt reauthorization act put into the 2012 NDAA.  an act that has been banned since 1947 I believe, or at least a year around there.</p>

        <p>Ahh again here we go.  Dude, your hot pocket is ready upstairs, go out into the world for once in your life.</p>
<p>Maybe if you listened to the videos you will understand what Birx said explains less deaths in other countries.  Hows europa doing right now?  Massive increase in "cases"... but do you want to start talking about the PCR test?  What do you know about it?</p>
<p>PS- cases are not infections, asymptomatic SuPeRsPrEAdErS (aka I dont have the virus but used a bunk test that said im diseased) is all bs-- its never been a thing.  Its made up to keep people like you in favor of lockdown and other insane life altering power grabs, and to keep that face covered, just gotta have the FACE COVERING</p>

        <p>Yes thanks for citing old acts from the U.S. and somehow implying there is a global power grab with no evidence--Liberal definition of COVID=government power grab.  Even if half of those deaths weren't directly caused by COVID, the country is still doing a shit job.  Also, look at the excess mortality rates this year, if anything, it is probably underreported.</p>

<p>They told you who is essential and who isn't, where you could shop and eat, where you can walk, who can work and who must sit at home hoping to get the money needed to pay for their next childs meal,  other countries are told you have to stay in their homes 23 hours a day, cant go more than 5km, cant have more than one person leave their house... are you stupid?  Can you not look further than where your self-righteous ass lives in this exact moment and see where this leads.  Next up climate change lockdowns.</p>
<p>Highly contagious and barely deadly, so let's fuck more people up in the long term and far more deaths.  But you dont care about that, you only care about the shock-value of instant death from your coronacircle-jerk news feeds to appease your paltry mind. </p>
<p>You didnt give a shit about aunt Edna who missed her early cancer diagnosis and now only has a year to live because our govt forced hospitals to suspend everything clinic related at the start of this circus, you didnt care about Bob who couldnt manage his diabetes during lockdowns and now will die 5 years earlier, you didnt care about Tom and Lisa who own the shop down the street and worked their entire life for, and now lost everything leading to Tom taking up drinking and causing his HTN to worsen stroking him out in a year.  Etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc.</p>
<p>You dont give a shit about anything but yourself, you just like to project and virtue signal that you do cuz its trendy and you have some void that you need to fill with your self-importance fantasies.  Keep that face covering diaper on, especially in between those bites to eat🤪</p>

        <p>I don’t doubt that there is mismanagement on some level because there is no control at the Federal level, at least here in the US. There is complete lack of organization at the Federal level. </p>
<p>There’s a lot of switching of hands in terms of responsibility and who has to own up to who. If the administration had a well oiled machine, we wouldn’t have lost critical millions of dollars.</p>
<p>However, your situation was not the most common. We hospitals here are max occupied in the cities in terms of acute care. Many health workers have been exposed to the virus and some have to take indefinite leave.</p>

        <p>Yes, this was necessary in order to focus on acute/emergency care. </p>
<p>I remember when my mom was sick, we took her to the hospital and they wouldn’t even let me in- she was checked in at the door. </p>
<p>They had a station set up at the entrance of the hospital, where they would question the patient regarding their visit, and would turn away individuals with outpatient needs, but usually refer them elsewhere for care. </p>
<p>Hospitals did not have direction at the Federal level on how to address this. Hospitals suffer a lot financially when they report deaths- it’s not good for their bottom line, and especially not if it’s COVID-related. </p>
<p>The fear that the virus would spread throughout the hospital was so great, they decided not to take a chance and that’s why those things that could be taken care of at a later time, were. </p>
<p>Is that the best plan? Who knows. The emergency response at a nationwide level here in the US was a disaster. The amount of funding that medical facilities receive is determined by their outputs. Imagine facing critical funding being pulled because of things outside your control? Face shutting down the facility, or minimize risk? It’s a lot more complicated than many people understand</p>

        <p>I despise literally everything about masks and lockdowns - but Trump is right not to do a damn thing about them. Constitutionally, he lacks the power and he is respecting that. Action either way would be a severe expansion of federal power. </p>
<p>As for the governors: I expect many of them (excluding psycho fascists like Newsom and Cuomo) are just acting out of peer pressure and a perception that masks are popular (media propaganda is effective both ways). If Trump wins, it’ll be viewed as popular support to reopen and get rid of mask mandates; if Biden wins, the opposite.</p>

        <p>Trump could speak forcefully to the mayors about their human rights violations. But the lines of communication are so broken down now between him and most dem politicians, that’s not really on the table. He doesn’t have their ear. It’s become so much more uncivil than past presidents.</p>
<p>But in a perfect world, just daydreaming... I’d like to see Trump advocate to free the people of CA, NY and MI using old fashioned diplomacy, and also to use the bully pulpit to make inspirational speeches to the American public about how we aren’t going to let a little bug take us down. We are better and stronger than that. </p>
<p>If he’s elected (big if) I hope he chooses to be conciliatory and inspirational and lead us out of this darkness. There are things he could do even if ending masks and state lockdowns aren’t in his purview. </p>
<p>And id love love love to see him pull the reins in on fucking fauci! I know he can’t be fired but can’t his job description be altered?!</p>

        <p>I’m absolutely pro choice and FWIW, abortion is literally not an issue at the federal level - the law is settled on a super controversial topic and one has any reason to unsettle it.</p>
<p>Roe is NOT going to be overturned, and anyone who votes at a federal level based on abortion issues is a moron. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>SCOTUS doesn’t want to overturn Roe. It’s pretty settled fucking law on a highly controversial issue. There is NO BENEFIT whatsoever to overturning Roe. There is a massive cost to overturning it, as doing so would seriously jeopardize the judiciary as an institution (and btw our chief justice is exceptionally concerned with SCOTUS’s standing as an institution). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Democrats don’t want anything to change about abortion law. They get a huge portion of their votes from single issue voters who care about the right to abortion. They count on these votes to win elections, and they need to be able to say, “if you don’t vote for us evil republicans are going to force you to have babies.” </p>

<p>States are different but at a federal level a vote based on abortion is a completely wasted vote. </p>
<p>As far as SCOTUS goes, you could pack the court with justices who strongly want to overturn Roe ... and they still WON’T do it because of the impact on the judiciary.</p>

        <p>Regardless of your opinions on abortion, Roe should be overturned because the legal argument behind it (right to privacy hidden in the 14^th amendment) makes no sense and is a clear example of legislating from the bench. I disagree that overturning Roe would "jeopardize the judiciary as an institution" (though I admit that Roberts doesn't feel the same), but rather restore it as a branch that interprets rather than creates law. Judicial decisions should be based on the law, not on judges' personal feelings about issues. Precedent should not be blindly accepted, unless we believe that cases like Dred Scott should stand because they were "settled law". Also, overturning Roe would not ban abortion, but would instead return the power of regulating it to the states.</p>

        <p>I agree - I am completely pro-choice but Roe is bad law. That said, if we’re overturning bad SCOTUS precedent, there are more important places to start (Wickard comes to mind). And regardless of what should be done, what will be done is almost certainly nothing.</p>

He lost me when he went all covid woke called for national lockdowns, mask mandates (which would be January 2021 when we should be moving on) even if those things are not federally enforceable imagine what he could do. You’re gonna have doomers behind the wheel nationally. </p>

        <p>I'm still wrestling with this honestly, trying to decide between Trump or voting libertarian. I used to "vote blue no matter who" but the government reaction to covid has changed that for me. Biden will certainly not get my vote and I'm honestly more concerned if he wins than 4 more years of Trump. I'm in a swing state too...</p>

        <p>A vote for a libertarian effectively helps Biden win. Might be outweighed for some by the impact of strong support for a third party (it may lead to a stronger campaign <em>next</em> election), but the immediate consequence is a benefit for Biden.</p>

<p>Where's that? Certainly not where I am. </p>
<p>At any rate, they shouldn't be mandatory for anyone, children included. Their too young to make many decisions, not just medical decisions, so parents make those decisions on their behalf.</p>

<p>&rt;I know there are also real incidents of parents being arrested for neglect if their children weren't and later died from whooping cough, or others</p>
<p>That's a tough one, given that I don't think any medical procedure should be mandatory. Were there any other factors in those arrests? I know some groups refuse to seek certain treatments after people fall ill, blood transfusions come to mind.</p>

        <p>I have been a lifelong Dem.  Still lean liberal on policies (ie pro-choice, pro-LGBT rights, pro-healthcare reform)  They already started losing me in 2016 when they went all-in on TDS and rigged the primaries to prop up the worst candidate they had, but I still reluctantly supported Hillary over Trump because I saw her as the lesser evil.</p>
<p>But right now?  The entire party has completely lost my support.  Liberal culture is exclusionary and toxic.  And  I'm supposed to get all hot and bothered over a senile child molester and a racist tyrant for what reason exactly?  All they have to say for themselves is "we're not Trump".  And they know they're losing ground too.  They're the party that most aggressively pushes this "everybody must go vote! vote vote vote!" philosophy, because they know that brainwashing apolitical/undecided people into joining their team is the only chance they have at victory.  Trump is the natural winner and the Dems know it.</p>
<p>Not that I like Trump or the GOP either, they're a bunch of assholes too.  But I cannot justify supporting lockdowns, so unless creepy uncle Joe changes his stance, I'm team Trump at the moment.  I could not have imagined 4-5 years ago that I would ever say that sentence but here we are...</p>

        <p>You might be surprised, Trump is most pro-gay president that has ever entered the office, he was defending them for over 20 years ( you can see this in past interviews if you look it up) and they are reforming healthcare to maintain quality and affordability in the long run. </p>
<p>As for pro-choice that's based on a state by state basis, not really a presidential level issue. </p>
<p>Don't feel bad about voting for Trump, he's actually a good president.</p>

        <p>What's funny is how many actually are wealthy. From my experience, leftists tend to be middle/upper class and actually hate the poor. They see the lower class as a hungry, tired, easily manipulated tool. Nothing more.</p>

        <p>Omg the following line was too ridiculous:</p>
<p>"He says we're learning to live with it. The truth is the American people are learning to DIE with it"</p>
<p>That's when I knew Biden would only use emotional appeals in the debate. He essentially stole Kamala Harris' playbook for how to debate and it backfired on him big time like it did Harris. His entire rhetoric was about how "the virus is taking away our lives and our way of life and how we have to buckle down and endure the ride"</p>
<p>And meanwhile Trump is actually providing SOLUTIONS and giving hope.</p>

        <p>Even if another 200,000 die, that would only be half a million total. Between 2 and 3 million die every year. Nevermind how many who die from COVID would've died from the flu next year, or how many died from the flu and were misreported as COVID deaths.</p>

        <p>I can't believe I'm actually rooting for Trump this time. It's not just that his views align with mine on the virus - I'm beginning to wonder if he's been misrepresented all along. From across the Atlantic I think he'll be good for the UK. I think he won last time because his message was positive and made people feel good about themselves, rather than the 'everyone's a racist' guilt narrative of the dems. I'd consider myself fairly left wing in ordinary times but part of me feels like he's the only thing standing in the way of a mass woke cultural revolution centred around guilt, self denial, lockdowns, collectivism and the surrender of individual liberty. If I were an American voter I'd be willing to put my reservations about his personal behavior to one side for that.</p>

And I know my case isnt unique and I see the others my age pulling their hair out over the stress. This feels worse than going to prison, because at least I wouldnt be solitary confinement constantly loosing my mind.</p>

        <p>He articulated the negative health impacts of lockdowns.  He talked about the low mortality rate and specified that we know who is high risk and who is not, so we should open the economy and focus resources on protecting those people.  When Biden tried to blame him for the cluster fuck we are in, he called out that it was the (largely democratic) governors who locked down and put families out of work, and those states with surging cases now are the ones who locked down the hardest.  He also clearly pointed out that Biden is pro-lockdown and would want to shut down the economy, which Biden did not deny.  When Biden praised New York, Trump slammed him on the high mortality rate there and policies that put covid patients into nursing homes.</p>
<p>Biden pedalled a lot of fear and doom and claimed that 200k more people would die by the end of the year.</p>
<p>I have to give it to Trump, he still isn't the strongest debater but he did a good job fielding these questions, and it is clear he has actually learned a thing or two since the 2016 debates.</p>

        <p>Good to hear, he's been talking out both sides of his mouth on the topic a bit. Tds sufferers will take anything he says and do the opposite, but I've been wanting someone to just come out and say it. Lockdowns are the dumbest idea anyone has ever had. </p>
<p>I voted for Bernie last election and usually vote moderate because I can understand the argument for many different viewpoints and wanted out of the two party bs, but I just voted for Trump this time because I don't think he'll end abortion and he might lessen Lockdowns and is less of an obvious pedo and than Biden is, plus Harris is... a choice.</p>

        <p>Nice one Biden. Him and these governors and all the other doomers are clearly exploiting the opportunity to say “vote for me so I can return us to normalcy.” Which isn’t possible (unless it’s all been a coordinated effort). Hopefully people can see through the bullshit.</p>

<p>Trump was also hindered massively this year both with Chris Wallace essentially debating Trump himself to protect Biden, and this moderator NEVER asking follow-up questions to Biden and asking constant follow-up questions to Trump and giving Trump only 10-30 second replies while she gave Biden  1-3 minute replies.</p>

        <p>&rt;Biden wants plexiglass everywhere.</p>
<p>At least, you could argue plexiglass actually is useful. That might cut down on robberies since a robber couldn't jump over the counter.</p>
<p>I watched a pre-2010 video where a man shot at a hotel clerk. The clerk closed the glass right before the wouldbe robber shot, and since the glass was bulletproof, the clerk was unhurt.</p>
<p>Obviously, not on people's faces, but I'm all for plexiglass around employee areas since that's real physical protection from a real potential threat.</p>

<p>Funny, when he first won, I- ashamed as I am to admit it- somewhat bought into the media lies, and so spent a whole day in bed, thinking America was going to hell. It did eventually, all right, but not because of Trump.</p>

        <p>I agree for people that are more rational and just tired of hearing about COVID and the new normal. But most people that are for Biden are all for the virus and masks, measures, etc. Having a more positive take on the virus will just push them more toward Biden and away from Trump.</p>

        <p>This is just not true. Data shows a majority of people are still scared of getting the coronavirus, it's the top issue for people, around 30-50% say it's their top issue, and Biden is perceived as being better to handle the situation. I may not approve of this premise but it's the reality and facts don't care about my feelings. The reality is that the public thinks corona is some new plague and they think Trump has downplayed it.</p>
