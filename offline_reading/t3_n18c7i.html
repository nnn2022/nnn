    <strong>“Vaccine shedding”</strong>
    <p><p>Is there any truth to “vaccine shedding”? I work mostly outdoors but I share a very small office with 3 other people, 2 of which just got their second shot.</p></p>

        <p>I haven't seen anything reliable so far, but I've read thru parts of Pfizer's clinical study protocol from Nov 2020 and there were protocols for contact with trial participants, which is strange, if not alarming.. </p>
<p>8.3.5.3. Occupational Exposure</p>
<p>An occupational exposure occurs when a person receives unplanned direct contact with the 
study intervention, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. Such persons 
may include healthcare providers, family members, and other roles that are involved in the 
trial participant’s care.</p>
<p>The investigator must report occupational exposure to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE. The information 
must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Report Form. Since the information does not 
pertain to a participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; 
however, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Report Form is maintained in the 
investigator site file.</p>
<p>And then there's the equally unsettling:</p>
<p>8.3.5.1. Exposure During Pregnancy</p>
<p>An EDP occurs if: 
• A female participant is found to be pregnant while receiving or after discontinuing
study intervention.</p>
<p>• A male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a 
female partner prior to or around the time of conception.</p>
<p>• A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to 
study intervention due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of 
environmental exposure during pregnancy: </p>
<p>• A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after 
having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact.</p>
<p>• A male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study 
intervention by inhalation or skin contact then exposes his female partner prior to 
or around the time of conception.
The investigator must report EDP to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The initial information submitted 
should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to 
termination of pregnancy).</p>
<p>• If EDP occurs in a participant or a participant’s partner, the investigator must report 
this information to Pfizer Safety on the Vaccine SAE Report Form and an EDP 
Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. Details of the 
pregnancy will be collected after the start of study intervention and until 6 months 
after the last dose of study intervention.</p>
<p>• If EDP occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the investigator must report 
information to Pfizer Safety using the Vaccine SAE Report Form and EDP 
Supplemental Form. Since the exposure information does not pertain to the 
participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, 
a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator
site file.</p>
<p>but what do I know? I'm just an uneducated conspiracy theorist..</p>

        <p>The document being passed around from Pfizer is discussing what happens if the liquid vaccine gets on your skin, not if a spike protein gets on your skin. They misunderstand what the "study intervention" means. Not saying anything is right or wrong, just that the document is being misinterpreted.</p>

<p>So then why do they specifically note this? I mean how would someone expose their partner, who's not in the study, to the vaccine liquid?</p>

        <p>They are looking to observe any issues with conception from either male recipients getting the vaccine and then getting a woman pregnant, or a female recipient getting pregnant, which, surprise surprise, there weren’t any issues in the study and in fact the only miscarriage in the entire trial happened in the placebo group and 23 women got pregnant during the Pfizer study with no adverse developmental effects. The part about possible “shedding” that the original comment was alluding to was this line:</p>
<p>“A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact.”</p>
<p>Which is referring to the possibility of the vaccine liquid somehow getting exposed in the environment (maybe a vial breaking) and the possibility of a pregnant woman (like a nurse administering the vaccines) getting exposed either through skin contact or inhalation of droplets in the air. Which, to my knowledge at least, wasn’t really an issue in the 40k person study.</p>

        <p>…what…?</p>
<p>Read this, very slowly, this is the portion you’re referring to:</p>
<p>“A male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a female partner prior to or around the time of conception.”</p>
<p>The male has received the vaccine (study intervention) and then has caused the female to conceive. Exposure to what is what they’re studying here, but it’s not happening through skin contact or inhalation. They wanted to see if there was any possible impact to the sex cells of the male or female, which there wasn’t through observations of numerous conceptions during the study period.</p>

        <p>My point was that contrary to your original comment, skin contact was not the only thing being looked at it in the study. Also I think it's a tad early to say that there was no impact to sex cells.</p>

        <p>I think it will all depend on what the spike proteins created from the injection do after wards.  There are some signs that made me suspect they are mobile, and shifting around the body.  If they can do that, escaping the body could happen.  I still feel like it would be in a small amount, although creating a "vaccine" that is a virus was one of the goals of medicine, since then we would have no escape.</p>
<p>I guess we'll see.</p>

They asked you to report anything. So in my opinion that means there’s a chance. 
“ 8.3.5.3. Occupational Exposure

        <p>I have seen convincing evidence against masks, lockdowns, social distancing, infection prevention, vaccines in general, and the covid vaccine in particular.</p>
<p>I have seen a lot of anecdotal evidence that vaccinated women are having an effect on unvaccinated women.</p>
<p>BUT I don't know of <em>any</em> mechanism by which this could be happening. What you shed yourself is mostly breath and old crunchy skin cells, neither of which would have an abundance of spike protein.</p>
<p>Now, it's very possible that humans have an asofyet unstudied mechanism for information transmission, particularly immunological, between each other. Are pheromones functional in humans? I need to look into that.</p>
