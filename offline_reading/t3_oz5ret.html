    <strong>So Sick or Outright Dead</strong>
    <p><p>I definitely do NOT wish any harm on all the snake charm followers out there, but both the hubby and I believe that this will quiet way down within the next couple of years as all of these  vax'ers are either extremely ill, have some type of terminal disease, or are outright dead.  We even have family members we already grieve for and they haven't been affected just yet, but we know that putrid spike protein is doing it's nasty little evil job inside their bodies so it's just a matter of time.  The scary thing is, that if the elite want us all dead, how the heck are they going to take out the free thinkers, when all the snake charm followers are gone?  Poison in the water?  Nukes?  I mean heck, most of them have fled or are about to flee their countries to move to their elite private islands.</p></p>
