        <p>I keep saying this but people just downvote me and insult me, but if obesity was a huge factor for death from this virus, the death toll would still continue to rise to this day. Young obese people would be dropping dead in countries like the United States and UK, because there's millions of overweight people in these western nations.</p>
<p>The big contributing factor for death is old age, and having another immune compromising illness present like cancer. Even people with both of those have survived COVID. The death rate is low all around, even for the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. Obese old people are a) overweight due to years of inactivity, b) already overweight from poor life choices that contribute to <strong>anything</strong> they develop when they are an older age.</p>
<p>My three deceased grandparents died overweight, for instance, but they were definitely slim and healthy when they were younger. Most old people are not going to look like super models or athletes.</p>

        <p>I'd agree if fat fucks were the only ones actually dying from this. Like I said in my initial comment, they really aren't dropping dead in the streets. Hell, people of all ages, health status, and other demographics are <em>catching</em> COVID. It doesn't seem to actually affect most people at all, even the elderly and immuno-compromised. There's always a risk of death from basically any illness, even the common cold (my grandpa died after catching a random run-of-the-mill cold), and it applies to essentially anyone and everyone. This is what we should be advocating here, that people be less terrified of this virus, as the risk of death (and "permanent damage") is small.</p>

        <p>I just feel like people here just want to this into a crusade to bash fat people. But the fact of the matter is that this virus isn't killing fat people at the indiscriminate rate they are claiming it to. If it did, we'd continue to see more deaths because there's a lot of fat people in the west. Even in Italy, most of the obese dying from this were 70 years or older. Most of the obese dying currently are also afflicted with other health problems, most of which are very specific and that any virus can wipe them out. Note how many of the teens that are dying, for example, were overweight but <strong>also</strong> born premature, had drugs in their system, were in a vegetative state, etc.</p>

        <p>Detroit was an early hotspot, due largely to obesity.  For awhile we had a daily 'healthy X year-old dies from coronavirus' story on the news, and I gotta tell you, almost without exception that person needed to lose a lot of weight.</p>

        <p>Hm. I followed the news a lot back in the early spring and summer, and I never saw a significant uptick in obese people dying from/of COVID there. No more than the kind I saw in various other states.</p>
<p>Even still, Detroit is another location like NYC, New Jersey, Italy, etc where there's many contributing factors that may exacerbate deaths in general like pollution, poverty, bad medical facilities, corruption (in the way they recorded deaths), etc. Remember also that Michigan has Whitmer at the helm... I'm sure she and the media are trying to highlight a lot of the "X year old died" stories, which are very rare anyhow.</p>

<p>The fact that this virus effects overweight people disproportionately isn't disputed. But it doesn't follow from this that we should see more absolute deaths in the overweight.</p>

        <p>And then they'd use the spare capacity as an excuse to reduce the total number of beds. There's actually been a movement in many places in recent decades to reduce the number of mostly-unused beds to make the system "more efficient". Thus hospitals are usually almost full in a normal flu season and are "overwhelmed" whenever anything nastier than that spreads.</p>

        <p>Well, putting on a mask is a lot quicker and easier than losing weight, at least for most people. Besides, it's fitness that makes people healthier, not weight loss as such.</p>

        <p>I've pushed this in my personal life. its always followed by "WELL SOMETIMES FAT PEOPLE ARE LIKE THAT GENETICALLY!" I then proceed to ask them if they have ever seen a fat concentration camp prisoner. They don't say much after that</p>
<p>People want an easy way out. People don't want to believe that they wouldn't be fat if they just fasted 3 days on 1 day off for a couple of months</p>

<p>-Fauci was talking about meeting people through Tinder.</p>
<p>-The elites in Canada talked about using glory holes.</p>
<p>You shouldn't have multiple sex partners, and also personally push for a monogamous relationship, and try darndest to have one partner your whole life. STDs are actually easily preventable unlike covid.</p>
