    <strong>Took the Pfizer vaccine today. Time report.</strong>
    <p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>As a type 1 diabetic I was invited to take the Pfizer vaccine. Im on the fence with these kinds of things, no long term research made me uneasy but the other side of the coin, catching covid which can become severe, doesnt seem much brighter. </p>
<p>I took the vaccine 1 hour and 30 mins ago.</p>
<p>I was greeted at the door of the centre by 3 people who checked my name and appointment time. I was then led inside where a lady checked my temperature and handed me my vaccination card. I was then directed to another room with 3 people who further directed me to the nurse's room. There were two nurses in there and I was asked if I had any allergies, or have had the flu recently. One of the nurses then told me to lift my sleeve, and she injected me. In total, less than 2 minutes from when I walked in. I was told to wait in another room for 15 minutes incase of any adverse side effects and handed a leaflet with all the information about the vaccine and its side effects.</p>
<p>The staff were very friendly.</p>
<p>I didn't experience any side effects at the time, and no pain in my arm still.</p>
<p>I am however, starting to feel really tired (although I only slept about 4.5 hours due to anxiety).</p>
<p>Thats the only part I didnt like, waiting in a small room with 2 other people (all masked though). Yeah they leave the door open, but it just doesnt make sense to me to sit in a tiny room with people.</p>
<p>Another issue being diabetic, when I get anxiety my blood glucose rises a LOT. This is the flight or fight survival response, where the liver will start pumping out glucose to give you energy to run or fight. This usually makes me feel headachey, nauseous and right now I just feel quite nauseous but it feels like its from my high blood sugars (went up to just over 12.0 mmol/ and very slowly started to come down to 9.5mmol/l after 8 units of insulin.) so I dont think thats from the vaccine.</p>
<p>Will update as time goes on.</p></p>

        <p>Hope you feel better soon, I've known a few people have it and they all felt rough and strange afterwards. Please try and sleep, hot shower/bath, eat nutrition dense food, and try not to worry too much.</p>

<p>If you are sick and take drugs yeah it's obvious you cannot adapt to this environment and you become free game to any pathogen that circulates. But not everyone is like that. And not everyone wants to be sick taking drugs and become like that.</p>

        <p>yeah you could say fear got to me, but then theres also the fear of covid when I know a handful of people who have had it, one of my brothers good friends got it and his parents too, and him and his parents had to spend more than a month in ICU. Also being a diabetic, ive been in and out of hospitals all my life, been clinging onto life while unwell on a hospital bed, and if the vaccine can help me avoid it from covid, id rather do that than spend another portion of my life wasting away in a hospital bed sleeping in a room full of strangers, some with mental issues.</p>

        <p>Listen man, for diabetics the other side isn't any better. I know people way too close to my circle that were healthy and suffered horrible symptoms of covid, and just recently a healthy 40 year old my sister was friends with with no underlying conditions died (covid put him in a stroke, organs started failing, brain ultimately failed and he died). Its not that easy to understand the severity of this virus until it hits close to home - media isn't up in the faces of people saying bye to their dying relatives via iPad, to the people suffering severely alone in ICUs - there's no dignity in that. So we don't hear of it a lot. But damn from what I've heard has happened to people close to my circle I would not be knocking a diabetic for taking the vaccine.</p>
