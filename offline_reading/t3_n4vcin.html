    <strong>What is Informed Consent?</strong>
    <p><p><em>*Every  human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to  determine  what shall be done with his own body; and a surgeon who  performs an  operation without his patient's consent commits an assault,  for which  he is liable in damages.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>*Justice Benjamin Cardozo, 1914</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>What Is Informed Consent?</strong></p>
<p>There are 4 components of informed consent including decision capacity, documentation of consent, disclosure, and competency.</p>
<ul>
<li>Doctors   will give you information about a particular treatment or test in  order  for you to decide whether or not you wish to undergo a treatment  or  test. This process of understanding the risks and benefits of  treatment  is known as informed consent.</li>
<li>Informed  consent is based on the  moral and legal premise of patient autonomy:  You as the patient have the  right to make decisions about your own  health and medical conditions.</li>
<li>You   must give your voluntary, informed consent for treatment and for most   medical tests and procedures. The legal term for failing to obtain   informed consent before performing a test or procedure on a patient is   called battery (a form of assault).</li>
<li>For many types of interactions (for example, a physical exam with your doctor), implied consent is assumed.</li>
<li>For   more invasive tests or for those tests or treatments with significant   risks or alternatives, you will be asked to give explicit (written)   consent.</li>
<li>
<p>Under certain circumstances, there are exceptions to the informed consent rule. The most common exceptions are these:  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An emergency in which medical care is needed immediately to prevent serious or irreversible harm</p>
</li>
<li>Incompetence in which someone is unable to give permission (or to refuse permission) for testing or treatment</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Informed Consent, The Right to Refuse Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Except  for legally authorized involuntary treatment, patients who are  legally  competent to make medical decisions and who are judged by  health care  providers to have decision-making capacity have the legal  and moral  right to refuse any or all treatment. This is true even if the  patient  chooses to make a "bad decision" that may result in serious  disability  or even death:</p>
<ul>
<li>To  document that you have been  given the option of obtaining a  recommended treatment or test and have  chosen not to, you may be asked  to sign an Against Medical Advice (AMA)  form to protect the health care  provider from legal liability for not  providing the disputed  treatment. Refusing a test, treatment, or  procedure does not  necessarily mean that you are refusing all care. The  next best  treatment should always be offered to anyone who refuses the   recommended care.</li>
<li>If, because of intoxication, injury, illness, emotional <a href="https://www.emedicinehealth.com/stress_health/article_em.htm">stress</a>,   or other reason, a healthcare provider decides that a patient does not   have decision-making capacity, the patient may not be able to refuse   treatment. The law presumes that the average reasonable person would   consent to treatment in most emergencies to prevent permanent disability   or death.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.emedicinehealth.com/advance_directives/article_em.htm">Advance directives</a>   and living wills are documents that you can complete before an   emergency occurs. These legal documents direct doctors and other   healthcare providers as to what specific treatments you want, or do not   want, should illness or injury prevent you from having decision-making   capacity.</li>
</ul>
<p>And  it's possible that requiring people to take a medication to access  services, to be allowed entry or to travel; or even to make statements  that a person must take a certain medication, actually could be seen as  practicing medicine without a license.</p></p>

        <p><em>To piggyback OP, the ~~vaccine~~ synthetic substitute can't be forced and neither can vaccine passports. Vaccine Passports actually enact the ADA.</em></p>
<p><strong>The government hasn't mandated vaccine passports because they can't.</strong> That would be against ADA Law and the 14th Amendment, which is why only private businesses (where you need a membership) can implement these policies.</p>
<p>The EEOC has declared Covid-19 a "direct threat" so employers could test for infection, but lack of immunity is not a direct threat and thus is covered under ADA Law. You would need to be given "equal access" or "reasonable accommodations" for a "public establishment". <em>The Vaccine Passport Rollout has enacted ADA Law and it applies to all public businesses with public access like the mall, or walmart, or a grocery store.</em></p>
<p>If we continue down this trail of following <em>for-profit</em> MSM propoganda then it will be established that the vaccine has enabled herd immunity, in which case it will be brought up that vaccine passports should be implemented. Stop being a labrat or enjoy the complete evaporation of liberties.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong> it's a clinical trial, so obviously long term effects are unknown. The industry's vaccine being pushed (Pfizer) is one of, if not the most,  criminal habitual offender in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Be on the ready if any public business tries to ask about vaccinations</strong></p>
<p>https://www.ada.gov/criminaljustice/cj_complaint.html</p>
<p>The definiton of "disabled" is even more vague than you may imagine. </p>
<p>https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/notice-concerning-americans-disabilities-act-ada-amendments-act-2008</p>
<p>&rt;The Act retains the ADA's basic definition of "disability" as an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities</p>
<p>For DCVPs <em>(Digital Certificate Vaccine Passports):</em></p>
<p><em>(imo)</em> Therefore, if you are NOT able to access an establishment due to a vaccine passport, then you are "DISabled" from free access and equal opportunity, which is illegal. Same as if an establishment had stairs leading to the only entrance without wheelchair accessibility.</p>
<p>14th Amendment, Section 1 (cutout):</p>
<p>&rt;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws</p>
<p><strong>You can say this is false, but medical establishments have been discussing this for months:</strong></p>
<p>https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/vaccine-credentials-how-make-sure-they-re-done-right?keyword=immunization%20passport</p>
<p>https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/key-questions-about-covid-19-vaccine-passports-and-the-u-s/</p>
<p><strong>ALSO you are not required to disclose the clinical trials you have taken part in, which is literally what Covid "vaccine" is... so no matter what way you look at it, it's all BS</strong></p>

        <p>How do you reconcile your last comment regarding the requirement of vaccine to access services, with the fact that schools require routine vaccines ? The same argument could be constructed that they are practicing medicine without a license, however this argument is never made.</p>

        <p>Schools have varied policies, depending on the state. Generally, mandating medication is a violation of conformed consent. Laws are challenged and it can take a while for these processes to be argued. </p>
<p>In my opinion, the gain from mandating any medical procedure is minimal compared to the damage caused by the overreach and potential for abuse of power. You may not see the impact of these policies for decades. </p>
<p>Covid has so many controversial claims echoed by a few influential voices that there is absolutely no justification for this to even be discussed. I do not accept that the statistics being parroted are reliable in any way.</p>

        <p>I disagree with the decision. At any rate this is decision in regard to constitutional question and is therefore irrelevant in a discussion about informed consent. Also please refrain from using acronyms and other tropes to enhance your credibility. Try earning it.</p>

<li>Whether you agree with the decision or not is irrelevant; this is currently the precedent on which states rely. </li>
<li>I didn‚Äôt use any acronyms with respect to any important points. I included a link to the exact court case that‚Äôs relevant. </li>
<li>I am very much against forcing the COVID vaccine, on the grounds that the relevant data demonstrate that it does more harm than good.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm attempting to provide more information that‚Äôs relevant to the discussion, and allowing readers to take it as they wish. If you‚Äôre throwing out this case just because you don‚Äôt like it, why are you any better than our opponents who pick and choose which data they agree with?</li>
