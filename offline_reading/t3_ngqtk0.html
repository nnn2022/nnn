    <strong>New Idea For Protesting Vax Passports</strong>
    <p><p>I'm already seeing businesses require proof of vaccination in my city, specifically a music venue. I think a great way to protest this is to get in line to "buy" a ticket and then get to the door and refuse to show your vax ID. </p>
<p>Then, have about 20 people behind you who are doing the same thing. Completely fuck up their ability to do business by forcing the issue. </p>
<p>Stand your ground and make the bouncer toss you one by one. </p>
<p>This will eliminate the rule faster than any action in government. Target these businesses one by one and see what happens.</p></p>

        <p>My values aren't going to change based on whatever new values the world decides to embrace today. </p>
<p>Businesses have a right to refuse service to <em>anyone.</em> And, just like bakers that go out of business for not serving gay people, it is up to us in the <em>free market</em> to sort them out financially. </p>
<p>If you really believe that we're the silent majority, don't concern yourself with these businesses. They'll alienate themselves from their clientele.</p>

        <p>Why are we giving them so much power? We already know that the government uses private businesses to circumvent the constitution. Why should they be able to? We need to focus of individual liberties first then we can talk about ‘private businesses. We shouldn’t be okay with private businesses stepping on our rights just because it isn’t the ‘gOvErMeNt’</p>

        <p>If they are <em>forcing</em> businesses to require vaccines to allow patrons, then you'd be absolutely right. I don't believe in government <em>interference</em> with business. If the bakery doesn't want to make a cake for a gay couple, then we just won't shop there. If a business requires a vaccine, then we just won't shop there. </p>
<p>I get your overall point, and with the way socialism is rising, we may see all businesses become state-owned and then you'd have a very, very solid point. But we're not quite there yet.</p>

        <p>Right, but we already have HUGE and very powerful corporations and we’re really not too far from that. The only way to stop it is to fight against it now, not when it’s too late.</p>
