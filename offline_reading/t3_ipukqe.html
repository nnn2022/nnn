        <p>The only thing that sucked is that I was thinking so much about not wearing a mask, I forgot my money and couldn't buy anything. A guy gave me a dirty look and I grinned at him. It took so much courage to do this, btw. I've been wearing a bandanna for weeks.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I didn't get called anything, spat on, or bothered by an employee. I have asthma, so I'm actually exempt, although Mask Nazis of course think I should be wearing one unless I'm pushing an oxygen tank (and I take a daily maintenance inhaler, 2-4 times, but I'm not at that point with it). There are also the people who think I should be shut in the house in case I die from COVID. News flash, I probably had COVID in February, and it was bad, but not THAT bad.</p>

        <p>Within my entire health unit, that includes municipalities up to two hours away, we have one case. The chances of me having it are very slim (especially since I think I already did, before the shutdown, when people hardly washed their hands and it was very easy to get it).</p>

        <p>The other day walking into a grocery store, a guy going in in front of me grabbed a free mask and handed it to me asking if I wanted it, I said no thanks, he then repeated if I wanted the mask, I then sternly said NO, thank you. And that was the end of it. I'm done with the bullshit. If you're afraid, stay home, get curbside groceries or whatever. The world is still turning, let's keep it moving.</p>

        <p>I haven't been challenged like this yet but keep expecting it.  I'm considering waving my hand in a jedi-like fashion and saying "I don't need a mask" or something similar based on the situation.  Could be interesting to see how they respond.</p>

        <p>Here's something I posted earlier.</p>
<p>1) For every study that shows that masks are effective, there is a study that shows that they are not effective. The science is far from settled on the matter. And from what I have read, the case against masks is much more compelling. </p>
<p>2) More importantly, theoretical studies, while nice and all, take a back seat to actual real world, in practice, data. We have months of data from all over the world where mask mandates have been implemented. And when you actually look at the results of those mandates, it is extremely clear that mask mandates DO NOT slow the spread of the disease. Let's look at a few examples.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong><br>
California issued a statewide mask mandate on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/18/880583357/california-gov-newsom-makes-face-masks-mandatory-amid-rising-coronavirus-cases">June 18</a>. And some places like Los Angeles County had mask mandates in effect since <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/05/l-a-county-coronavirus-update-public-health-director-says-masks-are-in-fact-mandatory-across-the-entire-county-1202935226/">May 14.</a> So you would think that cases would slow down in California, but that's not what happened. <a href="https://imgur.com/dZVhEwi">Here</a> is the daily new cases chart from <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/california/">worldometers</a>. It clearly shows that mask mandates have not led to a slow in the spread of the virus. In fact, the opposite happened. As masks were mandated, cases began to rise at a more rapid rate. After the statewide mandate, cases dramatically increased for over a month until it peaked on July 25th. If masks were effective, you would expect at the least a flattening of the curve. But this did not happen. What is also interesting is that Los Angeles County accounts for nearly half of all of California's <a href="https://imgur.com/ky2V0gh">deaths</a>, and they have had a mask mandate in place since mid May. And this <a href="https://imgur.com/PNjQIHP">map</a> from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html">New York Times</a> shows that California, and the LA area are very compliant when it comes to mask wearing. Mask wearing has not been effective in California.</p>
<p><strong>Florida</strong><br>
The same thing happened in Florida. While there is no statewide mask mandate, most of the largest cities in the state (Miami, Tampa, Orlando) implemented mask mandates by <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/06/19/major-florida-cities-now-require-use-of-face-mask-in-public-places/">June 19th.</a> Yet after the mandates, cases continued to rise for nearly a month, finally peaking on <a href="https://imgur.com/48pabWz">July 13.</a> And in similar fashion, the curve wasn't flattened at all, on the contrary, the rate of new cases increased after mask mandates were implemented. Mask wearing has not been effective in Florida. </p>
<p><strong>Texas</strong><br>
Texas has a similar story. While a statewide mask mandate was issued on July 3rd, the largest cities (<a href="https://patch.com/texas/irving-tx/dallas-county-judge-issues-order-requiring-face-masks">Dallas</a>, <a href="https://houstonse.org/blog/harris-county-new-mask-order/">Houston</a>, <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=342433">Austin</a>, <a href="https://www.bexar.org/3234/COVID-19">San Antonio</a>) all implemented mask mandates around June 22. Yet after this mandate, cases continued to increase regardless, finally peaking on <a href="https://imgur.com/qUuLpYw">July 16</a>. Mask wearing has not been effective in Texas.</p>
<p>The same thing can be said for Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. All of these places implemented mask mandates, yet cases continued to increase regardless. And this is not just an American thing. The same thing has been observed around the world. Spain, France, Belgium, and countless other nations implemented strict mask mandates, only to have cases to continue to increase. And then you have places like Scandinavia, which didn't impose masks, yet had similar results (Sweden) or better (Denmark, Norway, Finland). </p>
<p>The data is overwhelming that mask wearing does not slow the spread of covid. Nearly every place where it has been tried has not resulted in reduced case numbers. So why should I support a policy that is not backed by science or data? Why should I be ok with governments ignoring actual data and implementing policies that have proven to not be effective, and in many cases seem to exacerbate the problem? Yes, the act of wearing a mask is not a huge deal. But the principle of allowing governments to mandate behavior that is not supported by data or science is very troubling.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the information. I will do my due diligence and copy your post and look at this in more detail. Appreciate the response with civility.  My first reaction to the mandates in certain area like Florida and Texas I wonder if it has as much to do with the wearing of masks or the timing of mandate. Virus was in full swing by the time mandates came into affect. I don't know but we're they enforced? I think there are many factors contributing to the number of Covid cases. IMO</p>

        <p>Most mandates have been enacted while the virus was in full swing. It's generally a reactive move made by politicians who want to appear to be "doing something", without having to go back to strict lockdowns. But if masks are as effective at preventing the spread of the virus as mask advocates claim, after mask wearing is mandated, you should see at least a flattening of the curve, or a slow down in the rate of increase. But that's not what you see. Pretty much anywhere you look, mask wearing is mandated, and there is no change in the trajectory of new cases. In fact, it's fairly common to see an increase in the rate of new cases. </p>
<p>At some point you have to ask yourself, how are we to know that masks are doing anything. The science has been all over the place. <a href="https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy">Here</a> is an article with multiple studies showing that masks are not effective at reducing the spread of viruses. And there are plenty more out there. But, at the same time, I am sure you could find another article with multiple studies showing that masks are effective. The point is, there is hardly a consensus. But regardless, masks have been mandated around the world for months, with the promise that they "work". But how is this been determined? I keep getting referred back to some theoretical studies, but why should we rely on studies when I can show you graph after graph of actual real world, in-practice, data from all over the world showing that mask wearing has not led to slowing down the spread of the virus? Masks had no noticeable impact on new cases in <a href="https://imgur.com/48pabWz">Florida</a>, <a href="https://imgur.com/qUuLpYw">Texas</a>, <a href="https://imgur.com/dZVhEwi">California</a>, <a href="https://imgur.com/zMGMY1q">Michigan</a>, and many many more states. Even look at <a href="https://imgur.com/PtrMq9K">New York</a>, without any masks, their cases peaked on April 10th, and have been steadily decreasing since. A week after NY's peak, they mandated masks, but instead of seeing a more rapid decrease, the trajectory stayed constant. What did masks actually do in New York? Now take a look at <a href="https://imgur.com/BFeiUv0">Sweden</a>. They had no masks, and barely any lockdown at all, and just like New York, their cases peaked, then decreased on their own. Is there some something that you have seen in the data that tells you that masks work? What does masks working look like? And where do you think masks have worked? </p>
<p>As for enforcement, pretty much every store in the country has had mask mandates since June, and many as early as May. <a href="https://imgur.com/PNjQIHP">Here</a> is a map from the New York Times showing that mask compliance is fairly high, where most people live, and where the vast majority of cases and deaths have occurred. For sure, mask mandates don't mean much if no one actually wears masks. But 1) By most accounts, compliance to mask wearing is relatively high and 2) Even if only half the people are wearing masks, that means half the people are wearing masks, and that should be reflected in the data, but it's not. And 3) If the policy requires 100% compliance and professional level application of the policy in order to be effective, it is bad policy. I could say that if everyone acted just like Jesus, then all the worlds problems would go away. And while I guess in theory that is true, in reality is impossible and foolish policy to depend on. </p>
<p>You are right that many factors contribute to covid cases. My point is that there is way more compelling evidence showing that masks have little to no impact on the spread of covid. I am yet to see anything in the data that points to masks being effective. I hear people tell me that it's proven, or the science is settled, but these claims are never backed up. The numbers are there for everyone to see. And the numbers simply do not support the idea that masks work.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the exhaustive research you have done. It certainly has me questioning just about everything regarding Covid 19 and   it's transmission. Data is all over the place with this. We just don't know enough about it and it seems to be mutating as well. 
There is a sub r/ virology . I haven't been on it for a while .Most of it is way above my head but I would be interested in your opinion .</p>

        <p>Well for me, there's no science behind it. The "virus", which has not been isolated, is much smaller than the holes in the fabric of the majority of masks making them useless. Then there's the fact that the "virus" has and extremely low mortality rate and for a 39 year old like me has a 1 and 19.1 million chance of catching and dying from it. Mask are extremely unhealthy especially if you don't change them after 30 minutes, cloth and cotton being the worst due to them retaining moisture and giving a perfect environment for mold and other bacteria to flourish. You in turn inhale that bacteria for the duration of the time you wear it. The medical ones disburse micro fibers that you end up inhaling that accumulate in your lungs, also extremely unhealthy. Those are my reasons.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing the links, but only one of them works, the first one specifically. Edit: The second and third links were too close together, make sure you separate the beginning of one link from the end of another. Now regarding the first article lets break it down shall we?</p>
<p>On it's face it seems the article is informative however upon close examination it does have some contradictions though.</p>
<p>"<em>While high quality research regarding mask use is limited, all of the data supports mask wearing as a key public health measure to decrease viral spread.</em>"</p>
<p>I have a problem with this statement namely being the absence of "high quality research". You would think in the midst of a pandemic the only information you would allow coming from health authorities would be high quality research but admittedly, as pointed out above, this is not the case. So how am I to trust said information? Also scientifically speaking, you want the data to <em>prove</em> the efficacy of wearing mask and not just be <em>supportive</em>. The results of mask mandates actually shows otherwise given the fact that cases continue to rise in the areas that have mandates.</p>
<p>Remember, this virus has NOT been isolated and the PCR test used to diagnose people is wildly inaccurate and its true purpose stated by the inventor Karry Mullis was NOT intended for diagnosis.</p>
<p><em>For the general public, the reason for wearing a facial covering is to help protect others from you when you cough, sneeze or even talk and spray viral droplets into the air.</em></p>
<p>So where is your protection? One interesting thing about the article you shared is the fact that it states: "<em>If you desire 100% avoidance of infection, the only way to achieve it is to isolate yourself completely. That is not practical or mentally helpful for the vast majority of people."</em></p>
<p>Practicality is something that has been thrown out the window in all of this. I pointed out in another thread that suicides have actually eclipsed COVID deaths, soooo.....what exactly are we doing? Preventing deaths was the whole point of the lockdown but that has not happened so in all honesty this has been an absolute abject failure since it has not stopped deaths, COVID or otherwise, has destroyed many lives and businesses and has put the general population under massive amounts of mental stress and robbed others who would have normally received treatment at hospitals because COVID patients get priority.</p>
<p>"<em>The further away you are from an infected patient, the less likely you are to get the virus. Six feet is better than two feet and 12 feet is probably better than six. At some point the distance away becomes statistically meaningless. Unfortunately, there is no absolute correct number</em>."</p>
<p>The last sentence stands out to me the most. How in the world can you tell me to do something that you yourself know is incorrect? What that tells me is they're just guessing and that none of their suggestions regarding distance has any scientific merit otherwise they would present it.</p>
<p>"<strong>Do Masks Cause Low Oxygen Levels</strong>?"<em>Absolutely not. We wear masks all day long in the hospital. The masks are designed to be breathed through and there is no evidence that low oxygen levels occur. There is some evidence, however, that prolonged use of N-95 masks in patients with preexisting lung disease could cause some build-up of carbon dioxide levels in the body"</em></p>
<p>More contradictions. "<em>The masks are designed to be breathed through and there is no evidence that low oxygen levels occur."</em></p>
<p>Next sentence: "<em>There is some evidence, however, that prolonged use of N-95 masks in patients with preexisting lung disease could cause some build-up of carbon dioxide levels in the body."</em></p>
<p>If it is happening in your least healthy patients it is also happening in your healthy patients as well. This could explain why doctors have a life expectancy of 58 years on average especially when you add the levels of stress they experience day to day, long hours, etc.</p>
<p><em>"Masks are not 100% effective, but mask wearing does decrease the risk of viral spread. Public health professionals believe that mask wearing and social distancing are the keys to controlling the first wave and diminishing or avoiding subsequent waves of the virus. Mask wearing allows us to open the economy up faster. Not wearing a mask around others only worsens the pandemic, leads to more disease, and worsens the economic effects."</em></p>
<p>Lets examine this paragraph closely. The second sentence contradicts the first. The first sentence contradicts itself if we're to remember what was said at the beginning of the article. At the beginning of the article it stated: "<em>While high quality research regarding mask use is limited, all of the data supports mask wearing as a key public health measure to decrease viral spread.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>mask wearing DOES decrease the risk of viral spread."</em> How do they come to that conclusion when they admitted earlier <em>"high quality research regarding mask use is limited," ?</em></p>
<p>The second sentence admits they don't have proof and are only going off of belief "<em>Public health professionals</em> <strong><em>believe</em></strong> <em>that mask wearing and social distancing are the keys to controlling the first wave and diminishing or avoiding subsequent waves of the virus."</em></p>
<p>This is especially disturbing because science is suppose to explain how and why something is/works. If I want to go off of belief I would be better getting advice from a priest, reverend, or religious fanatic.</p>
<p>That same paragraph makes wild assumptions that: "<em>Mask wearing allows us to open the economy up faster. Not wearing a mask around others only worsens the pandemic, leads to more disease, and worsens the economic effects."</em></p>
<p>These assumptions cannot even be proven since hospitals are prioritizing COVID patients over ALL others so there is no way to take count of other diseases that may pop up simultaneously. Melbourne Australia is a perfect example of why the end of that paragraph is pretty much a flat out lie. The public followed restrictions and mandates with a compliance rate of over 95% and the authorities have clamped down further.</p>
<p>Again thank you for the links I hope this helps you understand my thought process and others on this subreddit regarding all of this. Have a blessed day.</p>

        <p>I’m in North America - Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. It’s completely open and people only wear masks if they want to. Looking forward to a live jazz concert tomorrow night. And no, I haven’t met any dumb lazy fucks. But I did meet a really cool entrepreneur who’s opening a bar on Independence Day (September 16). It’s a huge festival here and there will be many celebrations..</p>

        <p>I’m in Playa de Carmen, MX. It’s supposed to be mandatory. I keep one in my pocket but never wear it. Everything‘s around 500m from me like the gym which just opened this week so I usually take a skateboard to get around even though I’m about 40 years old I grew up surfing and skating no one says anything the police passes by me but in my gym they force you to wear it when you are exercising the regulations aren’t clear even though they’re the only one doing it they just don’t want to get fined as they can’t afford any more so that’s why they’re doing it from being out out of business already for six months. I spoke with the owner yesterday and she wants to take it off as soon as they can they doubled their prices and the only ones requiring masks it’s the best gym but I think they’re going lose business as the competing gym costs less and only requires a mask upon entry/exit. It is difficult to get a good workout in wearing a mask. They tout articles on social media about altitude training masks and the positive benefits but.... we are not altitude training here.. we just want to go for a workout. McDonald’s is open, liquor stores etc but gym just opened at the yellow level which was originally set to be green but they fought for yellow. And the state government has a bunch of online at home training videos which if you go to their Facebook page all the trainers are obviously overweight and out of shape. Super weird and illogical.</p>

        <p>Yeah i agree with that (I'm from north America too). Although parts of North America are waking up and have been going back to normal while other places are just doubling down ( California and LA for example). I don't know what it will take for the entirety of America to fully wake up but something has gotta give. I could very well be wrong though.</p>

        <p>We've been dumbed down quite a lot here in the UK. Not s lot of us are even questioning anything that's going on, let alone doing anything about it.

        <p>Only times I wore a mask: to see my grandmother at some point in June to keep her at ease, seen her since without one. And to have a haircut because I don't want my barber getting in trouble. I even went to a big wholesale store yesterday without one. One person looked like he was going to faint when looking at me. I only saw one maybe 2 other blokes without them but the guy at the checkout was pretty cheerful with me (although he wore one too, likely a company policy), I like to think my smile helped him through his shift.</p>
<p>I know it's silly but I spent months during the worst of the pandemic shopping every week without one (sometimes more than once a week) so I can't bring myself to actually put one on now when it's so much safer.</p>

Our teacher was talking about what the rules are for Monday and I turned to the guy next to me and said "This virus is nice for not infecting workers and school kids". Before I even finished my sentence I realised he's been wearing his mask for the last 4 hours straight and probably wouldn't laugh (which he didn't)</p>

        <p>Never going to be me (feeling discouraged).</p>
<p>I naturally dont like being told what to do especially when it concerns my own personal affairs that have no affect on anyone else. I suspect there are a lot of people that way around me and if nothing else my actions embolden and encourage others.</p>
<p>I related an experience I had walking into a target 30 min before closing (this is the best time to go in without masks - the clerks are tired and want to go home and have literally no fight in them to enforce those silly rules - it also helps those who are scared of losing their jobs if they dont try and enforce since its almost "closing time"),  anyway  ... I am circling the aisles to grab some items and some guy walks up to me</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>him: are they letting us shop without masks now ?</p>
<p>me: i dont know and I dont care</p>
<p>him: whats your excuse?</p>
<p>me: i cant breathe or some medical problem bullshit</p>
<p>him: good idea, ill take mine off, the air is stuffy on this aisle with the renovation they are doing on the ceiling and all the stupid relentless cleaning products </p>
<p>me: good idea</p>

        <p>I've noticed the same phenomenon before.  Nobody likes being the "out" group, so they'll wear masks if everyone else is.  But if someone else isn't wearing a mask, that creates social proof that you can do the same.</p>

        <p>In Mexico depending on the county you can be arrested or fined for not wearing a mask in public. Luckily where I am it’s only for shopping at any indoor store. A few weeks ago there was a small festival on health food and culture, I walked in with my mask and felt ridiculous, it was like the spell had broken, people where relaxed and it was like no one was paranoid or afraid, all masks off. Such a relieving feeling. It gave me hope in humanity.</p>

        <p>Went to a store yesterday. Was the only one in the entire store without a mask. Thankfully avoided any confrontations and used the self checkout, but the experience drove up anxiety through the roof. Even with no confrontation, it's honestly a friggin disturbing experience just to see everyone so blindly and mindlessly conforming. And this is in a small town 30-40 mins away from a medium sized city, where I had previously noted low mask compliance a few weeks prior.</p>
<p>You can see people are just complying out of fear and to avoid being hassled as they just put it on as they enter and take it off as they exit the store. They don't realize that they are enabling tyranny. This will never end without us taking a stand and ending it, holding those who seek to impose this to account.</p>

        <p>That’s awesome. I usually go to Sprouts and they literally have people at the entrances making sure you have a mask before you walk in. I don’t like the idea of going in with one on and then taking it off in the store. Seems like more trouble than the stores that just have signs up. </p>
<p>Also I still have to figure out what to say if someone asked me to put on a mask - conform or try to fight with the medical condition excuse.</p>
