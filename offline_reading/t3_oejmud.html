        <p>I'd pay attention to their reaction, especially if they are a neighbor or co-worker, or someone you cross paths with often.</p>
<p>I see hatred in the eyes of people for not wearing a mask OUTDOORS.  I've heard a coworker saying that they're disgusted and find it so selfish when they see someone not wearing a mask.  Even though New York Sate has fully re-opened an masks aren't required indoors or outdoors unless a business decided to.  Even when a business has a sign up it's often ignored and no one cares.  </p>
<p>Feels good right?</p>
<p>Don't get too comfortable.  </p>
<p>You know what some of these angry maskers want?  Vaccine mandates.  Vaccine passports.  If they're not advocating for it outright their questions alone indicate that they're likely to comply with it if pushed to, or support it.</p>
<p>When someone asks "How do we know who's vaccinated or not" what are they asking for?</p>
<p>I'm exhausted from this...  I'm tired of it and want my life back.  I'm in my mid 30s and have had a great life and this is just sucking so much of the joy from it.  I still have a great life, I still find joy every day.  I don't want to live in this "New Normal."</p>
<p>The fight is far from over.  Summer is here.  Fortify yourselves because the real challenge is coming.  People are in a state right now where they're very vulnerable to suggestion.  Every day, every week... Things are very dynamic right now.  I have no idea where we go from here but I don't have a good feeling about it.  Prepare yourselves for what's to come.</p>

        <p>I agree. I have peripheral vision. I'm more about making them feel invisible, rather than not seeing them.</p>
<p>I've just come off a 12 month mandate where my rights have been constantly trampled on, yelled at, threatened, had RCMP 'talk' to me by request of these people, I know fully well what they're willing to do. My response was to not speak to anyone, as to not normalize the Mask, and to ignore/ look through anyone else using a Mask.</p>
<p>I'm a middle-aged white man, I know I'm hated now for more than one reason. </p>
<p>They should be more afraid of me than I am.. because if I blow my top after years of patience and 'understanding' and putting up with this crap, it isn't going to be pretty.</p>
<p>And there's lots of other me's out there</p>

<p>Yup, I was at a bar over the weekend and there’s was some loser trying to talk to a girl while wearing a mask. It was clear that she was annoyed with his muffled and mumbling ass. </p>
<p>I literally just stepped in font of him and introduced myself. Started chatting up the same woman he was trying to talk to. I ignored the shoulder grab and angry mumbling and from behind me and just kept flirting with the woman.</p>
<p>Muzzle wearers are a joke and I treat them as such.</p>

        <p>They want to deny it all day, but they have a biological imperative to secure a man that will provide them security, so they can build a nest and have children, so generally they will seek the most aggressive male and/or richest and/or biggest (or 100 traits) to do that.</p>
<p>Sometimes it backfires, because that aggressive man, who truly can protect her and her kids, will sometimes slap her around too.. </p>
<p>Yet there is evidence, that with the rise of feminism, and women making their own income that they are in fact picking betas to mate with. if only because they can drive and control the relationship, and he is there to serve her needs..</p>
<p>So the dynamics are changing and it's somewhat entertaining to see biological imperatives clash with idealogical imperatives..</p>
<p>So now we see some having multiple pets, even plants ffs and call them 'their children'..</p>

        <p>Even in New York it never got as draconian as I'm seeing out of Canada.  I weep for the future of your country.  I can't imagine being up there right now.</p>
<p>I see people standing up in Canada and it fills me with pride.  I can't imagine the pressure.  It seems like they're going full authoritarian up there with massive fines, arrests.  There was that pastor in Alberta that got arrested.  Here at least the mask fines were just some $50 bs, and most cops just ignored it anyway.  In fact masks are still required on public transit and a lot of conductors are not enforcing it anymore.  It's one of the few areas left that requires them... for now.</p>
<p>Your experience is uplifting.  If you can stand up to that I can do so much better than I have.  Thank you for pushing back against tyranny.  If there's any cause I can support financially that helps liberty loving Canadians let me know, because we're in this together.</p>

        <p>I did my best, but eventually Cult of the Mask won and there wasn't much I could do anymore without getting stomped.. People have their cell phones at the ready, businesses have RCMP on speed-dial so eventually it wasn't worth it... why be a martyr when you're the only one out of 10,000 resisting.</p>
<p>I can't say I changed anything. Everything just steamrolled ahead anyway, and the protests on the street was pretty much everyone preaching to the choir, and like I said, still 12 months of mask mandates..</p>
<p>No victory at all. I won nothing. The only reason we have no Mask mandates is by the grace of our all powerful Health Officer, who could just as easily dictate another lockdown, and the Cult of the Mask will oblige, and police the rest of us.</p>
<p>There is nothing to celebrate, because people are trained to obey now.</p>

        <p>It's based out of not wanting to normalize the Mask in day to day society.</p>
<p>Did I have any effect? Probably not. I'm just one person..</p>
<p>But when for the last 3 months, people are walking around with their how do you dos, and oh nice day and wow what a nice shirt you have bla bla bla as if life is normal.. all while they're wearing a Mask, I didn't want to contribute.</p>
<p>And the moment the Mask Mandates were lifted and I had the chance to pull it off without the RCMP being called on me - I immediately ripped it off and continued on with my life- Freedom is a default setting, not a gift, privilege or something to be celebrate 'when it's given back to you...."</p>

        <p>I blame the common man for not being able to have common sense enough to read a bit outside CNN/BBC et al when a supposedly pandemic appears.</p>
<p>Especially since most of us have watched movies, TV series, read books, SEEN virologists working in full Hazmat suits for virus protection.
Now/then TV tell you a paper mask or a cloth bandana keep you protected against a virus that is supposedly ending every grandmother on the planet.</p>
<p>Sure, we can also blame media and Gov propaganda, but everybody (should) know that you can't trust either.
"Hi, I'm from the Government, I'm here to help" - should send chills through any body.</p>

        <p>It's not all people that want that bridge.
Some like the feeling of being submissive. Heck that's even a orientation within sex....
I have friends, family members, and colleagues that actually enjoy being a slave, using a mask, even when home alone, staying home 23/7, sometimes 24/7.</p>
<p>I guess some are born a doomer and flourish as a doomer.</p>
<p>I was a kind of a doomer back in April last year too. Because I'm a prepper, and love "The Walking Dead", I kind of had the hope of becoming a survivor... But no zombies.. Well. Some kind of are though.</p>

        <p>I was just out somewhere and my partner just got mad at me for feeling frustrated over everyone around me still wearing them. We’ve had this issue so many times where I end up feeling crazy for having such an averse gut reaction to them and I seriously can’t understand how it doesn’t bother her. Something about them makes me feel like I’m about to have a panic attack and I wish I knew anyone that could relate to this but no one else is bothered by them. To me they just symbolize how nothing is the same anymore and part of me feels like it’s just gone. Without them we wouldn’t be here.</p>

        <p>Totally the same here. I might be really stoned right now but I just realized the reason we feel this way is the confrontation is predetermined even if never acted on. As we pass a maskhole walking down the street it’s visibly obvious us and the covidiots don’t agree. Any meaningful interaction with one of these theatric clowns is predicated on BS because we visibly don’t agree on the “biggest” thing in the world.</p>

        <p>I disagree. </p>
<p>People that buy into this, wear the mask and excitedly get vaccinated are cringy and kinda pathetic but we have to remember they are ultimately victims of weaponized propaganda and group think. The education system and MSM have an incredible amount of power over the masses and the way they think.</p>
<p>If this Covid stuff happened 5 years ago I would have probably bought into it, got myself vaccinated and loathed anti maskers/vaxxers. </p>
<p>So if anything I feel bad for them and would rather spend my energy educating them in hopes that they wake up to the truth rather than hating them.</p>

        <p>True, but it scares me how many of them can be bought off so easily. I’m convinced these muppets would be happy to load us and our entire families into boxcars and exterminate us, and be convinced they were doing some kind of social good.</p>

        <p>I tend to agree. Everyone's just trying to do their best in this crazy world and a ton of people who were primed and ready for this viral load of state sponsored propaganda took it in without questioning it.  It's real psychological warfare against defenseless citizens who otherwise probably mean well in their day-to-day lives. They've been turned into unwitting soldiers in a war against their own countrymen.</p>

        <p>I refuse to leave them behind.<br>
its not their fault.</p>
<p>humans were using psychology for as long as we exist.<br>
modern humans figured out exactly how to trick the masses.<br>
we learned from the past and we learned good.  </p>
<p>hell, supermarkets are designed the trick you into buying more groceries than you need.<br>
you think that it stops there?<br>
we got these very subtle, but very efficient ways to manipulate each other and some honestly believe that their government and media are not taking FULL ADVANTAGE of this?!?!?!</p>

        <p>Sorry but isn't this just as bad as what this sub accuses the maskers of doing? Dehumanizing somebody just because of a personal choice is wrong no matter what side you are on. If somebody wants to wear a mask let them, as long as they don't bother me I don't care, I won't treat them any different. Do I think its stupid? Of course, but as long as they treat me equally I can treat them the same</p>

        <p>I've deduced that all anti-facers are mouth breathers.</p>
<p>See, they say that wearing a mask protects them from me breathing droplets on them.</p>
<p>Well, see, unlike them, I breathe through my nose, and my droplets go straight down to the floor, and maybe, just maybe if they would learn to do the same, they would stop launching viruses across rooms.</p>

        <p>Dont agree with this one. If they wear a mask and dont make a big deal about it/try to get you to wear one then what's the issue?
If they're a dick about it and try to act high and mighty about having a mask when you dont then sure avoid them but you acting high and mighty because you're not wearing one makes you the dick. Just be chill about it until they give you a reason not to.</p>

        <p>Even if I don't believe that Masks work, I am forced to wear it just so that I am not judged and to mingle with others, I am definitely not a Sheep. And here in India, we are fined if we don't wear a Mask so not much freedom. People are so afraid that back in Mar 2020, some people have already started to cover their face with a kerchief, even when their where no cases. A few months ago, delhi law required people to wear a Mask inside a car and a couple were arrested for fighting with the Police.</p>

        <p>I will continue to wear a mask and socially distance in my country because it’s no real big skin off my nose and it makes people feel more comfortable. Also it helps me slip under the radar like rubbing yourself in zombie blood in the walking dead…</p>
<p>But I am not taking that “vaccine”. </p>
<p>In 2023 it will no longer be a trial, if it has been proven safe maybe I’ll take it then. Or hopefully they’ll have developed a traditional vaccine for it by then, with ivermectin being widely used in the first world also.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind we have all been subjected to a relentless 24/7 propaganda campaign, the likes of which has never been seen before.
It's goal was to keep us divided and afraid.
So you can't blame people for being afraid but if you want to dehumanize people for that then you are just as brainwashed as they are.
Live how you want to live, let other people live their life.</p>
