    <strong>(contains spoilers) these times remind me of black mirror's men against fire</strong>
    <p><p>in black mirror's men against fire, a country perpetrates a genetic clensing of a group of people because they view them genetically diseased and thus inferior. they view them as genetically defective. the soldiers of this country have an augmented reality software installed in their brains that causes them.to view their innocent victims as dangerous, deranged, subhuman creatures. when in reality, they are scared, defenseless human beings</p>
<p>in todays times, people view each other as disease vectors. obviously the coronavirus disease is not genetic, but i do see some parallels. non maskers, anti maskers, mask choicers, those who go out and socialize, non social distancers, partiers, and gatherers are viewed as plague rats that spread virus. there have been countless instances where corona-dissenters have been victims of violence. their victimizers are the cororonadoomer authoritarians. </p>
<p>we have not reached a genocide yet, but based on how coronadissenters are viewed &amp; treated, and also based on how society is hostile to non conformity &amp; disobedience, i think we are headed towards something truly awful.</p></p>

        <p>if u are new to this general idea, then i suggest u search for example for:</p>
<p>"predictive programming"</p>
<p>at bare minimum it gets people to accept the whole idea, that gets presented much easier.</p>
<p>this is an EXCELLENT example of  programming:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WodXGiUemio">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WodXGiUemio</a> </p>
<p>the video is german, so u use auto generated english subs if required.</p>
<p>and in regards to that black mirror episode specifically u can look through tons of hollywood movies  for a long time, as the bad people were almost always middle eastern and hell a lot even specfically had a palestian scarf (keffiyeh) on.</p>
<p>this programming  made it much easier for the  20 year olds in uniform to think, that they are bringing "freedom" in the next middle eastern country, while also getting the public to much easier accept the more direct propaganda for an invasion war in middle eastern countries.</p>
<p>and there have TONS AND TONS of movies and series with a terrible virus and at the last second the vaccine comes and saves everyone and the insane government measures were justified and saved people, bla bla bla....</p>
<p>so u don't need  the implant  or software or whatever from that black mirror episode, BUT ultimately that will be the goal. maybe in 5 years the elon musk brain implant will be mandatory, or who knows what the bill gates poison injection will contain, without telling you.</p>
<p>if u want a good documentary about propaganda, its history and  how effective it already was, then i can highly suggest this documentary:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnPmg0R1M04">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnPmg0R1M04</a>  (part 1 of 4)</p>
<p>once u understand propaganda/mind control/predictive programming, then  it can't control u anymore like it did before and u can even point it out to your friends  and hopefully wake those up to the bullshit too.</p>
