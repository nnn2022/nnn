    <strong>Does anybody else find Duckduckgo unreliable?</strong>
    <p><p>I am trying to find research papers on Covid-19, how asymptomatic people and young children don't spread the virus (maybe I am wrong?). Every time I try looking something up, it is Mainstreme Media, CDC or WHO *only*.</p>
<p>I genuinely don't know where to go, because I recently traveled, and my family members are so adamantly refusing to allow me to even go outside for a walk, despite having no symptoms. What makes me more upset is that they keep treating me like I am going to kill someone if I get into contact with another person around my age outside. They don't want me leaving the property, partially because of the mandated quarantine, but also because they have a warped perception of Covid19 due to them listening to the TV all day, every day.</p>
<p>In Poland, the Quarantine is illegal and unconstitutional. Both of my parents just tell me to wait it out (despite them fully agreeing with me), however I am not going to bend the knee.</p>
<p>EDIT: My parents are not the ones being manipulative. I should have been more clear when I said "Family members", it includes both of my uncles, and my grandmother is also worried about covid-19, despite going to places without a mask (she has been vaxxed) . Both my parents are actually in line with my viewpoint on how Covid-19 was handled, and both my parents are very anti-lock down, and are both very skeptical of the Covid shot. </p></p>

        <p>Maybe its time to teach your parents about absolute vs relative risk? </p>
<p>I use DuckDuckGo, and I have noticed that certain things that I found easily in the past are no longer discoverable...like I was looking for a specific study that I had downloaded before and then when I was looking for it again to send the link to someone, I couldn't find it even by typing the author's name and paper title. Not sure if it was deleted though, as I had no luck finding it with Google either.</p>

        <p>Duckduckgo is far better than Google, but it's far from good. It used to be great, but it's highly censored anymore.</p>
<p>Add google translate to your browser. Then search on Yandex. If the results are not in English, hit the translate button. But look through the English results first.</p>

        <p>With DuckDuckGo you can change the location you're searching results for. Perhaps if you change country to look for? </p>
<p>As for your parents, I’m sorry to hear that... I can’t imagine living with controlling parents right now tbh. I’d have ran away.</p>

        <p>I should have been more clear when I said "Family members", what I should have clarified is that my 2 uncles are paranoid to death about this virus, and my grandmother is worried about it too (but not preventing me from riding my bike to the forest). Both of my parents are very anti-lock down, and don't believe that covid is deadly, and are not manipulative by any means. Both parents have been very good to me. </p>
<p>All of my family members were not very manipulative, but after a year and a half of this hoax pandemic, my family members are arguing all the time and think of each other as incredibly stupid. It's sad to see how despite my family members living in a once communist country, simply allow the mainstream media to brainwash them. Again, I can't find the research papers, and aside from corruption in American Politics, they need to see the European side of Covid corruption.</p>

        <p>They are, imo, clearly manipulating results.</p>

        <p>Yes. Duckduckgo is slowly becoming more like Google and is appearing to create the illusion of choice.</p>
<p>Use Yandex instead.</p>
