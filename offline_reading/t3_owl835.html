    <strong>I deleted the NHS Covid app by mistake and didn't realize for several days!! When I redownloaded the app my phone lit up with over twenty PINGS!!</strong>
    <p><p>I'd like to preface this with the following information: I'm fully vaxxed (double jabbed), wear several masks at a time, and socially distance as much as humanly possible. For further protection I wear a gimp suit and dog collar when I'm out shopping (the dog collar is just for fashion purposes though). I am NOT a Republican, I do NOT believe in 5G or microchips in the vaccine, and I VOTED for Biden via mail!!</p>
<p>Okay, so here goes: I was clearing out some apps the other day because my OnlyFans folder was taking up too much space (over 6GB worth of photos from my boo!!) and I accidentally deleted the heckin' NHS track and trace app!! Please do not judge me for this honest mistake!! OMG please!!</p>
<p>Since that day I've been out and about meeting friends and family (socially distanced, of course). I didn't need to scan any QR codes or do track and trace as we were mainly meeting in people's gardens or at the park for socially distanced picnics!! I had to replenish my stock of hand gel and masks yesterday though and when I went to scan the QR check-in code at Tescos I realized the heckin' app was gone!!</p>
<p>I almost collapsed right then and there (this has been happening a lot lately though so it might have nothing to do with the shock of my app not being there!!) and I could literally feel my heart stop dead in my chest (also been a reoccuring thing lately ðŸ¤·). I redownloaded it as fast as I could and my phone literally blew up in my hands (seriously, it's a chunk of molten metal now) from the amount of PINGS I had accrued during the app's absence!! Before the screen died I counted over twenty but who knows how many heckin' pingerinos I had!!</p>
<p>It's taken me a while but I've messaged everyone I've come into contact with the past couple days and notified them their days are numbered (sorry Gran!!). I thought about leaving them in ignorant bliss but it's more important that they know they're infected so they don't go out and spread the virus to others!! They can make peace with their fate now and take the proper precautions needed. I've made funeral arrangements for myself and apologized to those I've doomed to the ventilator!! Now all I have to do is sit and wait for the heckin' virus to take me to an early grave.</p></p>
