    <strong>Bit of hope: Dutch news: "masks cannot be made compulsory, not even as an experiment"</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5174259/mondkapjesplicht-mag-niet-staatsrecht-wim-voermans">https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5174259/mondkapjesplicht-mag-niet-staatsrecht-wim-voermans</a></p>
<p>Summary of news article</p>
<p>Here in the Netherlands the legal professionals are pretty clear. Similarly to the news article I shared a few days ago this one reiterates that it simply would not be allowed by the dutch constitution to make masks compulsory unless the "emergency situation" got called out, and our government is very reluctant to do that. Barring this emergency situation they would have to pass a special law that would makes masks compulsory and make that enforceable.</p>
<p>A "corona law" to make this possible cóuld be passed, but it would have to be discussed and approved by the parliament in the Second Chamber.</p>
<p>mayors of Amsterdam and Rotterdam are thinking of using an "emergency act" to push the law through in their cities at least. But professor of State- and Government Rights Wim Voermans says "While i can imagine they would like to do this, our constitution simply does not allow it."</p>
<p>making masks compulsory can only be done by a parliamentary law, "a lower order of government such as a mayor or the mayor's office could never do this." says Voermans.</p>
<p>The video at the bottom of the article is also very interesting.</p>
<p>It features Jaap van Dissel. He is the head of the RIVM, (Rijks Instituut voor Volksgezondheid en Mileu "National Institute for the health of citizens and the environment") He's basically the head of the Dutch version of the CDC except he also handles a lot of the environmental stuff. He's a big boss and very important right now, as he should be. He is also closely connected to the OMT- Outbreak Management Team. The video also features Tamara Van Ark, who is the minister for Medical Care.</p>
<p>Van Dissel makes a bit of a long sentence but in the end it comes down to him saying that after weighing all the evidence of more recent scientific studies (done since the last time he presented us with information) in conjunction with the RIVM and the OMT and it's scientific colleagues in Norway and Finland there is no scientific need that the government can tell to make masks compulsory. "In summary, the medical neccesity/Scientific proof for this simply does not exist"</p>
<p>Van Ark literally says around the 0:51-0:58 minute mark that "En omdat er vanuit medisch oogpunt geen bewezen effectiviteit is van mondkapjes heeft het kabinet besloten dat er geen landelijke verplichting komt voor het dragen van niet-medische mondkapjes" ("Because there is no proven effectiveness of masks from the medical standpoint the government has decided that there will be no national duty to wear non-medical masks")</p>
<p>Now why specifically the "non-medical" here you may think? Does that mean we could be forced to wear medical masks? I dont think that's what that means, though it s a loophole they might be able to exploit if they wanted to be sneaky. But our Prime Minster Rutte has said in the past that he believes the medical grade masks should remain reserved for medical staff who need them much more than the general public, so the general public, if they make a personal choice to wear masks, are told to wear non-medical ones. So with that knowledge it sounds like she is saying very clearly we are not expected to wear any masks.</p>
<p>Hubert Bruls - foreman of the security council does allude in the same video to the fact that some local measures may be implemented and says that "just because we dont make a national law now doesnt mean it wont ever happen, but at this time we and the Government think we have a good strategy for the coming weeks."</p>
<p>So yeah. I wont speak for america. But in my country masks simply arent enforceable by law anywhere other than in public transport. So I simply will not wear them. Thanks but no thanks.</p></p>

        <p><em>Had</em>. That's all gone. All those ideas about dutch sober and directness are gone, our culture has been destroyed. Our government has spent decades and millions changing perceptions about law and society. Social pressure used to be our police, you didn't steal because you had to go to jail, you didn't steal because all your friends would hate you. Our government was easy on the rules because banning things often leads to counterproductive behavior. Enforce masks and people stop respecting 1.5 meters. Put up speed limits and people start driving more reckless. We used to understand these things but now it's just about power and money.</p>

        <p>Yeah the mayors dont give a fuck. Meanwhile actual professors of law are baffled beyond belief because ...like... the cánt do this. It's not actually legal for them to do this. So yeah...</p>
<p>Luckily the mayor of Rotterdam is a wet flannel and has kinda shifted position just a tiny bit. Cause now he's saying "we EXPECT people to wear a mask" but they probably wont get fine if they dont and if they do get fined and the they fight the fine they have a very good chance of winning cause our courts arent stupid. They know this isnt kosher..</p>

        <p>Not sure if it's accurate (google translate), but it does say:  </p>
<p>&rt;If you want to introduce the mouth mask obligation very quickly, you can only do one thing in the Netherlands: declare a state of emergency. This has already happened in other countries.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In some cases you can suspend fundamental rights, Voermans says. "This way you can set aside the right to privacy. But the government apparently thinks that is going too far."</p>

        <p>Yeah declaring the state of emergency seems unlikely nationwide.
But sadly the two cities of Rotterdam and Amsterdam will still be "experimenting" with compulsory masks starting in 5 days. Despite the fact that legal professionals have stated very clearly that they can't actually legally do that. 
bunch of fuckers. I'll be going into Rotterdam next monday when the masks arent compulsory yet. I dont really need to go, I just wanna.</p>
<p>Cause once they make the masks compulsory who knows how long that little "experiment" will last. And I'm sure as shit not gonna wear a masks so i guess I wont be going to rotterdam in a while then.</p>
