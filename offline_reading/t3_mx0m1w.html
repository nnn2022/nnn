    <strong>WARNING: Rant here. Effects on side career of not going along with 2020's narrative</strong>
    <p><p>So, I'm about to gripe a little.  Go ahead and get on out of here, if you don't want to hear it.</p>
<p>As a side hustle, for the past decade, I've been an actor in TV, commercials, and films.  Nothing you've likely watched, unless you enjoy watching Lifetime, Discovery ID, and crime docs...I didn't get a ton of work, but I am a recognizable face, and I've trained a bit to develop my acting skills.  I greatly enjoyed the work, often for low pay, and long hours.  It fits my personality, I've travelled to some great places on someone else's dime, and met wonderful, great people, both in front of and behind the camera.</p>
<p>In 2020, during the summer, I yanked nearly all of my social media presence, aside from IMDB (international movie data base), as I grew sick of the pandering and social "causes" that permeated the internet sphere.  I saw that we had an unknown virus in March of 2020, we needed to take action, or so I thought, and I did.  I was willing to "Comply" for a period of time. Then, the summer riots, de-funding police, let the criminals run the asylum, took over.  I grew distant, and I just removed myself from all visibility. </p>
<p>Now, tv and movie people love to use social media.  THey promote themselves, and they promote one another.  I've done it before.  Two actors I last worked with in 2019, both appeared to have bought into all the social justice causes.  All the "protect one another" agendas.  Those two actors, as I discovered through a friends Instagram page, have been working in late '20, and into 2021.  A lot.  Meanwhile, I've continued to ask to be submitted independently for auditions, and received only one.  My talent agent in Atlanta, GA dropped me in Q1, 2021.  No reason given.  </p>
<p>My rant is that, when I attempt to look for work in this field, and thank God it's not my only stream of income, casting directors and people in the industry want to "know" you, or at least find out something, before booking you or asking you to audition.  I believe  that my lack of presence on social media, my lack of publicly getting on board with the agenda, limits me from ever working in the field again.  It's upsetting, though, again, it's not my main source of income, by ANY means.  I just enjoyed it.  I am thrilled to see some of my fellow co-actors, making debuts of their work at Tribeca Film Festival, on USA Network, and co-starring in prime time shows on networks like Hallmark, and a few others.  I just wish it was me.</p></p>

        <p>In the book 1984, a must read for these times, people are required, not optional, required to stand before a screen or in an assembly and practice something Big Brother calls the 2 Minutes of Hate. This is where you must yell, for all your worth, at the enemy of the day. This enemy can change on a moment's notice by the way, but that doesn't matter. The government tell you who to hate and your only job is to hate that thing or person.</p>
<p>This is what you are referring to but with a modern twist. Going forward, everyone will be REQUIRED to actively maintain multiple social media accounts and participate in whatever campaigns the government will be pushing. It will be the only way to "earn money" as a slave. Your social credit score will determine your viability in the very near future and your positive, unquestioning activism will be coerced through an empty belly.</p>
<p>Money, as a construct, is going away. This is a new Age and worth or value will be predicated, not on industriousness or creativity, but on compliance.</p>
<p>Finally, a reporter once asked Orwell during an interview what the intent of 1984 really was. He looked intently at the camera and said, "Never let it happen". He's speaking to us now.</p>

        <p>I finally listened to the audiobook (while I was at my night shift factory job last year), and I'm so glad I did.  Something a bit unrelated, but still very important, as long as you understand energetic/spiritual concepts like the ones described in the book the law of one (which I also listened to the audio book for, but it's a very complicated piece so it'd be better to watch Aaron abke explain it on YouTube).  </p>
<p>Basically it's the idea of energy vampires.  People who are service to self (aka being malevolent, or negatively polarized) gain polarity in that direction by exerting control over other people.  They also feed off of negative emotions.  Whether this is the elite/rich who feed on negative emotions or prey on the weak and innocent (think adrenochrome), or some kind of alien/reptilian species/high density AI using it as an energy source (the law of one explains this idea in more detail, I know it sounds insane), I don't know.  </p>
<p>Whether or not the energy vampire/alien stuff is true, having humanity live in low vibrations/emotional states makes us easier to brainwash and control, and prevents us from polarizing in positive directions.  </p>
<p>Cancel culture and hate culture opposed to acceptance and forgiveness (and rehabilitation in the case of pedophilia and other disgusting things) is just too rampant.  When you start to imply someone is wrong or suggest another perspective, people default to their ego and get immediately offended and attack you, even if deep down they know they're wrong.  Its all about defense and being superior.  Just a product of the hate culture we are all subjected to these days</p>
