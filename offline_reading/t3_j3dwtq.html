        <p>THey are literally locking kids in their dorms now in the UK and the USA, they are expected to stay in their dorm rooms 24 hours a day.  I suggest you have your kids just do internet college for now as long as this bs keeps up, why pay a bunch of money to go to a prison?</p>

        <p>Maybe community college with no dorms is ok cuz it's not so expensive and there is no place to trap you in, but otherwise, I would not suggest it, especially for first and second years.  Just get your basics done at community college and/or online and make sure the units are transferable to a better college, save money and be safer from whatever bs come along.  THis has always been a good route for first and second years and you can get into a better college if you have 2 years of good college scores already behind you because the colleges now have proof that you are a very good quality college student.  Then transfer to the prestige college to graduate and get that fancy diploma.  </p>
<p>However if you are third or fourth year now, that really sucks but I'd still do online if I could.  Longterm this could change how college is done though, colleges could let in unlimited numbers of students if it's all done online or a big chunk of it is done online, colleges could cut costs and let way more peeps in, that could change the long term value of the more prestigious school diplomas if more are let in.  But having that near term money waving in their faces, colleges would probably have a hard time resisting the temptation of getting those bucks right now anyway.  But if the value of their diploma drops, they eventually will not be able to command as much money for it, but they could afford that since costs would be cut.  Or they may be forced to drop the costs if too many students don't want to come onto campus.   I am sure imprisoning them will really motivate them to pay you a lot of money next year!  This could equalize some of the disparity for college access for the poor.  </p>
<p>And let me tell you, most of the fancy college hype really is nothing but hype.  Having myself gone to UCLA, the education there was inferior to the community college I started in.  Teachers at UCLA mostly did not give an eff, they were there for research and their few mandatory classes were just a hassle to them.   Some of them spent half the class just rambling about personal stuff, TAs handled most of the real questions and work load.  One of my teachers came right out and said he did not give an eff about us students and he was only teaching that class because he was forced to do it.  Amount of class hours per credit was low compared to community college.  I had been worried that having gone to community college first, I would be behind the other UCLA students, but the reverse happened, I was better prepared than them having gone to a college where the teachers cared, spent a lot of time on their lessons, and had smaller class sizes with more hours of explanation.  THe current college system is so broken and stupid, if covid takes it down a notch, that will be one good thing that comes out of it.</p>
