    <strong>More Relevant Than Ever...</strong>
    <p><p>Just thought I would share some quotes from the past that are more relevant than ever.  Feel free to share your own quotes.  </p>
<p>William Pitt the Younger: “Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves.”</p>
<p>John Adams: "Power always thinks it has a great Soul, and vast Views, beyond the Comprehension of the Weak; and that it is doing God Service, when it is violating all his Laws."</p>
<p>Robert Ingersoll: "In all ages the people have honored those who dishonored them. They have worshiped their destroyers; they have canonized the most gigantic liars, and buried the great thieves in marble and gold. Under the loftiest monuments sleeps the dust of murder."</p>
<p>Thomas Paine: "The more unnatural anything is, the more it is capable of becoming the object of dismal admiration."</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson: "The god who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time: the hand of force may destroy, but cannot disjoin them."</p></p>

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>&rt;“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be  better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral  busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the  same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of  those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never  will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.”     </p>
<p>- C.S. Lewis</p>
