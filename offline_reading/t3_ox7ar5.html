<title>Today's r/facepalm post tells me to unquestioningly trust the CDC. In 2020 Rachel Maddow told me NOT to trust the CDC because of their junk science and bad comms about COVID. Last year the CDC was corrupt, but today the CDC is the gold standard. Any questions? Don't ask!</title>

        <p>An SMS screenshot picture is making the rounds that insinuates that it's such a "duh" concept to simply trust the CDC and their guidance. This perpetuates an image that the CDC is above reproach and is above politics - both of which are demonstrably untrue based on my previous left-of-center media consumption. </p>
<p>Before COVID I had assumed the CDC were like one of those government agencies that were just scientists in lab coats tinkering with beakers. In the first season of <em>The Walking Dead</em>, the group of survivors makes their way to Atlanta to the CDC where they are met by a scientist who tells them it's all hopeless. I just assumed it was a skyscraper full of people in lab-coats.</p>
<p>From all my watching of MSNBC last year (we have Rachel Maddow on TV in my household almost every weekday evening), there has been great consternation regarding the arbitrary whims and bad guidance flowing from the CDC.</p>
<p>Now we can just chalk this up to Trump era being evil and draconian and yada yada yada, but ALSO, doesn't this all betray the fact that the CDC can (and does) modify its guidance frequently, based on little or no science, based on the whims of whichever administration is in charge? </p>
<p>THEORETICALLY, couldn't the CDC be peddling junk science and bad measures that sound good but aren't helpful? Does the CDC serve the populace, or do they serve whomever is sitting in the Oval Office?</p>
<p>To wit, here are just a sampling of clips conditioning me to NOT trust the CDC, an organization which I can apparently trust now?</p>
