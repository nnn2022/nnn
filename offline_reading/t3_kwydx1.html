        <p>This effect was talked about in the books "The Gulag Archipelago" and "The Demon in Democracy", both of which were written by men who lived through the worst days of the USSR.  Orwell touched on it as well in 1984.  These rituals and displays of piety have the specific purpose of breaking down the will of resisters.  By being forced to participate in the lies, you become morally degraded yourself.  </p>
<p>As Winston Smith's girlfriend Julia discovered, even if you think you're too smart to fall for it it will worm its way into your head eventually.  That's the whole point.</p>

        <p>I have relative and people I met at university who literally insulted me because I challenged them on the efficiency of masks against coronavirus... They're not talking to me anymore, so yeah, 100% agree. Btw some of those people had master degree in Physics and are now part of the corona sect. That's disturbing.</p>

        <p>Lmao I love how you immediately assume I’m some fragile “libtard” who fear mongers everything.</p>
<p>Nope, I’m pretty conservative and I attended a gathering myself for NYE, accepting the risks.</p>
<p>That being said, people who “draw their line” and make such a big deal about wearing a mask in public that inconveniences them in no way in reality are just the biggest, most self-centered scum bags there are.</p>
<p>I hate just <em>seeing</em> the masks everywhere-I’m tired of feeling like I’m in some post-apocalyptic zombie movie-but I fucking do it because it’s proven to <em>help</em> reduce the spread, and it makes everyone around me more comfortable. You will never <em>not</em> be the asshole if you’re making a bog deal about taking two seconds to wear a mask for ten minutes in public.</p>

        <p>I do. But I resent being called salami breath. </p>
<p>There's a lot of debate about how proven it is, so ease up.</p>
<p>And to me, it's not about the 30 minutes I spend in the grocery store, it's about seeing kids forced to wear them for hours, and service workers doing 30-40 hours a week in them.</p>
<p>In Toronto this has been mandatory since early July and self imposed by stores before that. So a typical full time cashier may have spent around 1000 hours wearing a mask. Until I see mask advocates with WFH jobs doing this in sympathy, I don't care what they have to say about it.</p>

        <p>I am the stereotypical WFH jabroni advocating for masks. But my wife isn’t. She is a Nurse and has to wear her mask for 13 hours a day despite very rarely working with COVID patients (she’s in the NICU). She hates it, but she gets it. It’s just necessary. Put up with it until it’s over.</p>
<p>PS there’s debate about whether the earth is round or flat. Just because there are morons debating it, doesn’t make it true. Masks help. Period.</p>

<p>I've argued the same as you, that masks are the wrong hill to die on for us skeptical of the lockdowns and restrictions. It's attacking the symptom not the disease. Most arguments against masks are 'try-hard' or stupid exaggerations.</p>
<p>But mask mandates are, or can be, an insidious tool to divide, control, break down resistance to the next slightly sillier thing. We're all being conditioned.

<p>Classic boomer-tier Facebook false equivalency logic there. Shows what you’re working with for a brain. Also, who are you cheersing? This isn’t England and we’re not in a pub; that reddit trend of cheersing in comment sections is so cringe.</p>

<p>If we were back in the 2019 mindset and people told you we would be now entering the year-mark of a deadly respiratory virus that is largely in-contained, 99% of people including you would be the first to go out and panic-buy all the masks you could find. Shut up with your false internet bravado. Also claiming that masks are a conditioning tool is a completely baseless claim you’ve made up to push other crackpot conspiracy theories-I bet you’ve been anti-can for years now, haven’t you? Pushing your bullshit ideologies to your unlucky friends and family on Facebook, who roll their eyes and make fun of you every time they see your posts.</p>

        <p>In her case there is evidence that it works. It's certainly not scientifically proven that making us mask up in the grocery store helps anything. I don't have a huge problem with it because there isn't a huge downside to it, but it's just not proven to be effective in an environment like a grocery store where you have minimal contact with strangers. </p>
<p>It just annoys me to be told "trust the science" by people who haven't actually looked at the research themselves and think "the science" is whatever advice the public health authorities are giving out.</p>

        <p>The fact that you believe that there is a reason in the first place to wear a mask, means you are too far gone and have fallen victim to the media induced mass hysteria that is gripping the world.  It's not about how quick and easy it is to take off and on, it's about by wearing one you are helping enable the lie.</p>

        <p>Lmao this is one of the most cringey, self-enlightened posts I’ve ever read. This subreddit is a gold mine. You know there’s actually evidence out there, scientifically-backed, that proves that masks help, right? Besides that it’s just common-sense? Do you need me to link it or do you just not care?</p>
<p>Lemme guess: the world is flat and all vaccines are dangerous, too?</p>

        <p>Sounds like most of the country tbh   New York. You have 4 boroughs (even Staten Island is red)   Long Island leans red.  Aside from Albany and maybe one other region, it is all red    Literally just the cities is what keeps them in.</p>

        <p>Just found this community, and I have a few question. </p>
<p>I don't really understand the anti-mask position. Even if you're skeptical of their efficacy (which has been tested quite numerously), why not wear it anyway? You know people will feel more comfortable, you won't risk getting in legal trouble, and it's not like wearing a piece of fabric is a huge burden on your life. </p>
<p>As for the Constitutional argument, who cares if you don't believe wearing masks falls under our Constitutional responsibilities as citizens? I've never once worn a mask because someone told me I have to do so. I wear a mask because there's a chance I'm asymptomatic, and I don't want to pass it on. I'd feel terrible knowing I may have passed Covid onto someone who ended up passing away from it. </p>
<p>It just feels like being anti-mask is just a forced attempt to make ourselves feel like victims. It's never been that hard for me to just wear a mask and avoid any sort of issues. Also, I can be confident that I've likely never given anyone Covid.</p>
<p>Can someone address these points?</p>

        <p>&rt; it's not like wearing a piece of fabric is a huge burden on your life. </p>
<p>You don't get to decide how much it imposes on me.  I get to decide how much I hate shit strapped on my face.  My body, my choice.</p>
<p>I have constant anxiety about breathing every single second I have one of those pieces of shit strangling me.  I can think of nothing else except counting down the seconds until I can rip that shit off.  I barely tolerate it for ten minutes of grocery shopping.  Mostly I nose-dangle and that makes it less hellish.</p>
<p>I know this sub isn't MaskSkepticism, so I'll couch this in this.  I'm not against masks for anyone else, wear them if you want to.  I get the feeling of safety, I bike a lot and always wear a bike helmet, I like that feeling like some people like the masks.</p>
<p>But the important underlying factor is the <em>personal choice</em> and that no person or government gets to dictate this for anyone else.</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask is such a minor inconvenience. Do you all whine about everything?  And have you been whining about this from the beginning? In case you haven't heard, we're all getting vaccines this year, unless you're a quacky anti-vaxxer, and a year from now you won't have to wear one when you walk through the grocery store once a week.</p>

        <p>I figured.  I'm not mad but I bet it's infuriating for you since everyone who knows you're an anti-vaxxer realizes you're a nut case right about now. 😂 While everyone else is being considerate of others, making sure they walk out in the grass when someone's approaching on a sidewalk or selflessly wear a mask to make it a cooperative group effort to try to contain the spread of the virus, you have to resort to the type of behavior where you're actually hoping to piss ppl off. You'd probably be a lot happier if you wore a damn mask. And because the vast majority of ppl in the world will get the vaccine, it'll stop the spread, we'll get back to normal, and you're gonna feel really dumb.</p>

        <p>It's just common sense. I have a brother in law who's a physician in the Philippines, extensively studied diseases and pandemics, and told us about covid a year ago before any media around the world was reporting it. He predicted it would get bad and dominate headlines around the world.. not just the US. What he didn't predict was that fox news and right wing media would be the only networks downplaying the virus. They had no other choice though because trump was the first to downplay it. He's like other virus deniers in that they're narcissistic and don't care about other people. He only cared about the economy because a good economy meant he was winning. He couldn't care less that it became the leading cause of death in 2020, and more Americans were dying every day than on 9/11 (which I'm sure you don't believe either).  No concept of empathy. </p>
<p>I have an uncle and aunty who died of Covid. They were sick for 2 months, kept going back to the hospital, in and out of the ICU and died within 2 weeks apart. The most disturbing part of this pandemic is people who have no compassion and only complain &amp; whine that they have to wear a face mask when going into a store for 15 minutes. However the overwhelming majority is taking it seriously and doing what they can to help contain the spread till we get vaccinated this year and life gets back to normal.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t know what fox news says as they lie just as much as cnn.   USA media is the problem, but that’s another topic.   </p>
<p>Just because I don’t wear a mask doesn’t mean I have no empathy, it means i’m NOT sick.   It’s great you want the heathy to wear a cloth mask that doesn’t  stop anything but i’ll pass.  If i’m sick i’ll stay home.   Not sure why this is a hard concept to understand.  wearing a useless mask makes you feel covid proof, but not wearing or even wearing isn’t how covid is spread or not spread.   </p>
<p>The virus death count in reality is not 300k+.   Hospitals aren’t at max capacity.    lockdowns don’t work.   calling us granny killers and selfish doesn’t work either.    </p>
<p>If your brothers sister step aunts friend wants to fear you into covid that is fine.   As i’ve said before some take longer to wake up than others.    I’ll use my time to live life and enjoy with people that are awake.   Unmasked and not afraid.    </p>
<p>It is amazing how people dream of going back to normal when for some of us we ignore the bs and just live normal.   </p>
<p>Good luck on your journey.   I hope you can disconnect from the media lies at some point.</p>

        <p>This has nothing to do with the media. John Hopkins isn't the media. It's also a lie that hospitals are not at max. I know hospitals are reaching max capacity and running out of beds because i had cancer this year and have had regular visits and surgeries at the main hospital here in Charlotte and experienced it first hand. I've asked my doctors who I trust and they all say it's something you don't want to get, it's a lot worse than ppl think, even long term effects. During my last operation, my curtained room didn't have a bed, just a recliner. When it was time to go to the operating room I had to walk down the halls with the IVs in my arm with the help of a nurse because there were no available beds to wheel me to the OR. I almost passed out walking into the OR. Nurse said the hospital was out of beds and whatever beds they could find were given to covid patients. </p>
<p>Frontline workers are also breaking down. Many can't take it any longer and are going on mental health leaves. These heroes need a break, working long hours away from their families for days at a time and helping save lives. I'm not worried at all about covid. Nothing really scares me now that I dealt with cancer. I wear masks for ppl like the healthcare workers, essential workers and frontline workers. They keep urging the public to take it seriously and cooperate with guidelines. You can spread the virus and wouldn't know it, especially if you spread it while asymptomatic. Why would top immunologists, scientists, physicians and experts around the world all be "in on a lie" like this? It's profoundly baffling how ppl can think the entire world is out to get them?  I'm wondering if it's a form of schizophrenia.</p>

        <p>Well listen kid. 
I have not worn a mask most all of 2020, and I can tell you that I also have not killed anyone in 2020.</p>
<p>If you think it’s the governments job to take care of your health, then that is your first problem. </p>
<p>Read the constitution and bill of rights again. If you don’t likewhat you read, leave the country. Stop trying to change the country into something it’s not. Plenty of us enjoy what it is and stands for.</p>

        <p>Yikes, better grow out of being a tool by the time you get to highschool. This is the best time to do stupid aka fun things is before you turn 18 while you can get away with everything. Masks aside WTF you doing being such a rule follower. You only have so many years of being able to do things and mess up before their are real consequences hopefully you haven't spent the last year of your life not enjoying the advantages of being young and consequence free.</p>
