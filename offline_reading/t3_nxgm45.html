    <strong>Why is the slippery slope "fallacy" considered a fallacy when more often than not it ends up being true?</strong>
    <p><p>COVID-19 is just the best example, but far from the only example of government overreach leading to disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Around the same time last year, many of us were making the point that imposing quarantines on healthy individuals and making them provide a negative test would pave the way for vaccine passports, which would eventually become required to participate in certain events, travel, go back to work or school, and a whole number of things. Yet this was summarily dismissed then as conspiracy claptrap, and now that it's happening in many places, it's as if it was chillingly "expected" to happen all along, rather than be another rung on the ladder of dystopian authoritarianism the architects of the "Great Reset" dreamed up to become our "new normal" and better control the population.</p>
<p>It's not too far beyond possibility that once these passports are forced on the masses in order to get to travel internationally or work, they will also eventually have to get a whole slew of other vaccines and covid boosters and follow the CDC's schedule, just like children have to go to public schools. </p>
<p>You could say similar things for 9/11. The DHS watchlist started with only about a thousand names in 2002 and now has millions of names, including people who simply attend a political rally or have beliefs that the government finds displeasing and are outspoken about those beliefs. Many people predicted they would use 9/11 as an excuse for the government to strip US citizens of their civil liberties when convenient and conduct surveillance of just about the entire US population, and were derided as 'extremist' and 'paranoid'. Then Snowden exposed this and crickets from these same people.</p>
<p>There is actually a name for it, 'the Ratchet Effect' by economic historian Robert Higgs, which basically says in every crisis the government expands its power, and the power gained by the crisis, whether real or manufactured, becomes permanent. Thinking about this seems obvious, but I can't tell you how many times a cynical skeptic warns of power grabs and are dismissed for "slippery slope fallacy" when the very things they warned about become true!</p></p>

        <p>Slippery slope is only a fallacy when the reasoning is ridiculous (e.g., “if you legalize marijuana, snakes will live in the crops and bite all our children!”). There are plenty of slippery slopes that do actually occur all the time, but people arguing on the opposite side of whatever issue just tend to use the “fallacy” label out of convenience when they’re too moronic to consider logical conclusions</p>

        <p>I remember very well being told last year at this time I was engaging in a "slippery slope" fallacy.</p>
<p>Now that exactly what we are saying is coming true they say, "oh, well sure there will be restrictions.  You didn't actually think there wouldn't be.  But <em>another after that</em> is another slippery slope fallacy."</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>It's a strategy they use to silence descent of their cult.</p>

        <p>There's this thing called the "Overton Window". Which, to grossly summarize is essentially the range of all acceptable beliefs at a given time. Now, the tricky thing, is that this window is mobile. At any given time it slides "left or right" depending on what the culture finds acceptable. The reason the Slippery Slope Fallacy is so often correct, is that the current Hard Left in control of the media use radical proposals to push the Overton Window to the left.</p>
<p>Today they are asking for legality of pedophilia, but that would have been appalling five years ago, when they were only asking for legitimacy for trans people, which would have been appalling ten years before that when gay marriage was on the table, etc. etc.</p>
<p>The reason the slippery slope "fallacy" is not actually a fallacy (I mean right now, it can be in other situations), is because pushing the Overton Window is the tactic the Left (most recently) and the Uniparty (in the last few decades) has been using for a long, long time. Whether it's for LGBT agendas, state control via COVID, the centralization of federal power (look back to a time before the DHS, ATF, FBI, etc. and realize that the founding fathers considered government-funded schooling and a navy to be horrifying ideas due to the amount of power it gave the government).</p>
<p>It's all about changing what it means to be acceptable. Gotta boil the toad one degree at a time.</p>

        <p>Ironically the people who are quickest to screech "muh slippery slope!1!" are also the ones who believe in The Right Side of History and the march of progress and that humanity has an inevitable end state (communist utopia).</p>

        <p>You are not wrong.  But there is a reason it is called a fallacy.  It can lead to false conclusions.</p>
<p>Consider the fallacy Correlation is Causation.  We know this is false.  Yet every true case of Causation does start with Correlation.  If one thing causes another they will occur together quite frequently. </p>
<p>Slippery slopes happen all the time.  (I prefer the term gradualism)  That simply doesn't mean you can use the phenomenon with any predictive power.</p>

        <p>In sales, it is called the “foot in the door strategy”. In psychology it’s called a compliance ladder.  No matter what you call it, the phenomenon is real.  Far from a fallacy, it’s practically a law of human nature.</p>
