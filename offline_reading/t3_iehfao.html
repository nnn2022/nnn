        <p>I was not an anti-vaxxer until yesterday. The news of Virginia talking about mandatory vaccines was shocking to me. When I began to dig into mRNA vaccines, I became a believer that the vaccine is, in fact, the Endgame. </p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle fell into place when I realized that Bill and Melinda Gates want to rush through a vaccine that has the ability to <em>make the human body create the viruses it is attempting to stop.</em> I am not a doctor, admittedly, but the idea that I am going to allow Bill Gates, or a National Guardsman proxy (Trump has been clear that he's going to mobilize the military to get the vaccine out as quickly as possible; Operation Warp Speed), inject an untested vaccine into me that will turn my body into a virus factory is... well. The end. </p>
<p>I believe the economy was crashed on purpose. I believe the vaccine will be tied into a Universal Basic Income scheme that will be withheld to non-compliant individuals. </p>
<p>I will go one step further and say that the BLM silliness is a massive sleight-of-hand to keep people worried about play-acting Marxists, when the <em>real</em> threat to our Republic is at the highest levels. </p>
<p>I will not comply. I will face every consequence of non-compliance, no matter how severe.</p>

<p>I think BLM was less an actual distraction, and more just a means of testing how far they could take the population on this ride. What do I mean by this? Look at what happened with BLM. These protests and riots were allowed, and encouraged by various governing bodies (not even just in the US!), and later stated that these events do not spread the virus. Most of the populace has bought this, and parrot the rhetoric that BLM is "safe" and you can't get the virus if you abide by the "good" done by protesting racial injustice. It's another manipulation tactic being employed by the governments, to try to turn our camp (the skeptics, conspiracy theorists) into "heartless bigots" that are rooting for things like racism, homophobia, etc.</p>

        <p>Nope, haven't seen it, though I can imagine what that video is about.</p>
<p>Also, sadly, people are dumb, and fell right for the BLM madness and the ensuing hypocrisy. I swear, whatever elites are behind this are probably laughing at the stupidity and malice of the masses, and they wouldn't be wrong... (I'm sure people here will downvote me, and call me heartless, but let's not deny that the idiocy of our fellow man is a part of why we're in this mess now...)</p>

        <p>All of the stuff that's currently rotten is based on deeply sound, deeply human, deeply compassionate principles. Public safety is important. Life is important. They're taking all the good things about what it means to be human and inverting them into tyrannical insanities.

<p>To me, I think many of the people we're dealing with now, use those humane principles as an excuse to commit horrible acts, whether something as small as insulting people online, or something big like assaulting someone for not wearing a mask. People want to look "good" but I don't think they actually understand what it means to be a good person. This is something I've observed even before COVID, though I think this has highlighted just how awful people are capable of being. The #AllInThisTogether stuff is the pinnacle of this, just empty words that they don't seem to mean at all.</p>

        <p>For most of human history, there were trustworthy hierarchies in place that arose naturally from the circumstances of the people involved in them. Kings rose to the top by virtue of their skill in protecting the people in their area. We thereby have a predisposition to trust that our leaders are acting in our best interests because for the vast bulk of human history, they were, in fact, acting in our best interests. </p>
<p>Our current system is totally detached from reality, but is still based on these ancestral memories that leaders are trustworthy. If a leader says something or someone is an existential threat, people will still believe them and act on them, trusting that eliminating the threat is what's best for society. But the leaders are lying. They own the media and can put any selfish thought into the masses of minds whenever they see fit. They weaponize our trust to their own ends. </p>
<p>Not everyone has the constitution to be a leader or a decision maker. Not everyone is destined to be a king. But the exact qualities that allow a person to be a modern-day leader, thanks to the disconnect from natural hierarchy, are exactly the wrong qualities: self-serving narcissism. Greed. Avarice. All those things will filter down into the brains of the non-leaders and create a society not worth living in.</p>

        <p>I just feel like you're just trying to excuse away the stupidity and malevolence many people have been acting on during this "scamdemic". I think the stupidity comes in as a part of intentional ignorance, of the trust in leaders, as you describe but only partly. The other is laziness, and also seeing this situation as an opportunity to exert their own means of control and harassment on people they do not like, similar to schoolyard bullies in grade school. I know <strong>a lot</strong> of people disagree with me on this in this sub, and I've been flamebroiled over it, but I will always hold the citizens who are supporting and encouraging the "New Normal" as being just as much at fault for the predicament we're in as the others "up top" who are puppeteering this whole fiasco. </p>
<p>Just to clarify, as angry as I am at these people, I also don't feel they should be subjected to the "New Normal" because humanity should still be free overall. Unfortunately, one of the biggest obstacles in this fight is our fellow man. If our fellow man also works with the elites and media to fight us, then we're always going to lose by sheer numbers alone. We'd need the support of these same masses to get anywhere in this fight. The question is, can they change? I think many of them won't regardless, but I am hoping there is still a chance...even if it is a small one...</p>

<p>That's because to disallow them under their restrictions would invite a court challenge that would get their restrictions thrown out on first amendment grounds.  In order to maintain their restrictions, they had to allow the protests to occur to stave off an easy court challenge.</p>

        <p>I don't think "it" is over just yet. I think some more stuff is going to happen in the coming months before we find out what the true objective is. I think the election in the US does play into whatever this game is, and we'll shed more light on things by the time it is over (though I don't think the election will end this like many predict, as much as I'd prefer it to be over by then).</p>
