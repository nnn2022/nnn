    <strong>Documentarian here. If anyone in this sub has a longterm mental illness that has been affected by the pandemic and restrictions, I'd like to speak with you.</strong>
    <p><p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I'm a journalist and documentarian interested in the personal stories of those who suffer from mental illness/sustained mental distress. How has the lockdown affected you? Has your mental health deteriorated, have coping mechanisms been lost to you, have there been dangerous moments? Or perhaps the ability to shut yourself off from the world was a benefit, allowing you to focus on yourself?</p>
<p>We all know that the pandemic and lockdowns have wreaked havoc on many areas of life; I wanted to narrow my scope and investigate this area of mental illness, hopefully incorporating interviews into a short doc I'll put up on Youtube, Amazon Prime, and social media. If all goes well, I'd like to produce many mini-docs on the various areas of life damaged by the lockdowns.</p>
<p>So if you have suffered with longterm mental illness, or know someone who does and would like to talk, please reach out to me. I have experience in this area personally, so I understand the reticence to speak up -- mostly for fear of being misunderstood. Long story short: I'll pick up what you're putting down, as it were. Thanks!</p>
<p>A little about my pedigree: I've been an independent journalist for a decade in NYC and LA, writing about sociopolitical issues. You can see examples of my work at www.codybrooks.club/journalism. This isn't my first time producing a documentary; I made a feature-length one about my native Hawaii and its modern-day problems, which was well liked on Youtube and Amazon Prime (link to it on my website, called "Aloha Dying"). This is the project of an independent journalist; I'm hoping to build up quality documentaries and share them as widely as possible. Thank you for your time.</p></p>
