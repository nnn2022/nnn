    <strong>mildly good news, if anyone needs it</strong>
    <p><p>i know every day we get a ton of “people are waking up!” posts and comments that don’t seem to really mean anything, so this may only mean so much to you guys on here, but i think people really are starting to change.</p>
<p>one of my friends who has been the most paranoid about the pandemic from the start—telling the rest of us we shouldn’t be hanging out when cases slowed summer of last year, double masking, etc—is done as fuck with the lockdowns. she and i were together last night and she said she doesn’t care if she gets covid at this point, she’s not wearing a mask again (she’s vaccinated so she feels it’s unfair) and she’s not doing another lockdown. she says she doesnt trust health officials about covid anymore, even fauci, beyond what she can verify to be true with her own experience (that covid can be dangerous, which i also believe). she does think people should still get vaccinated for their own sake, but she’s stopped believing it will prevent others from getting sick, and has agreed with me that it’s fucked up beyond belief to require proof of vaccination or to require vaccination itself.</p>
<p>like i said, i know we hear this a lot in here, but i really do think people are getting pissed. this is a complete 180 from where she was this time last year.</p></p>

        <p>They are getting pissed...</p>
<p>at the unvaxxed.</p>
<p>Even your friend is still bleating "Everyone should get vaccinated!". At this point, people should be questioning <strong>everything</strong> but they are not.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately she’s not completely “there” until she realizes the vaccines aren’t really vaccines.  They weren’t intended to protect anyone, as it seems</p>
