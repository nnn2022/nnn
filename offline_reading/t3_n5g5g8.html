    <strong>Have pandemic overreactions made anyone else apathetic to their hobby interests and hesitant to ever invest time or money in them again?</strong>
    <p><p>I have always considered myself somewhat of a renaissance man because I have a variety of interests and hobbies that I love to indulge both personally and with communities, but over the last year that has changed dramatically. In some sense, I've seen it as a blessing in disguise because I have taken my finances far more seriously, amped up my prepper efforts, and cut many loose ends. I have also gotten more involved in my community and really put my family first. That has been a blessing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my fears of another supply chain breakdown, UBI introduction, and new social norms that would prevent me from enjoying my hobbies and interests have me really just sitting on the sidelines. I don't want to invest anymore time or money into something if I should be investing in more for defending myself and community or if the world decides climate change is the newnormal and luxuries that I enjoy now just can no longer be shipped or bought by me. </p>
<p>Has anyone else been having these feelings? What have you done to prepare yourself for the changing world, while still holding onto the passions and hobbies that you enjoy? Could it be that I'm misreading all of this and just need to grow up? I'm looking for some perspective.</p></p>

        <p>Yup. Totally focused on family time, finances and getting into the best shape of my life. From my hobbies, motorcycles and guns have amped up quite a bit. Other than that everything else just feels like noise.</p>

<p>That's exactly what I've noticed. I got my money right, dropped a couple of pant sizes, and have been eating better than ever before. </p>
<p>I'm starting to wonder if the things I've been passionate about in the past are really that important and if the last year has been a powerful lesson in what I value.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm in Canada and firearms are a pain in the ass to deal with here</p>

        <p>I've certainly felt the pain of supply chain breakdown. I started the journey of buying a new TV on Jan 30 and was finally able to get one installed on April 17. As far as hobbies, it's good for your mental health to have something you can enjoy doing outside of time with family. If all you do is be worried about finances and prep for some disaster that may or may not ever come you're not living you're just surviving. I say find a way to do both in a balanced way.</p>

        <p>I had no idea that was the issue with televisions. Was it a particular model you were looking for or just in a general sense that TVs went into high demand? I remember hearing stories about many vintage video game consoles suddenly becoming worthwhile again because people were just hoping to stay at home and wait it out.</p>
<p>I think you're right on where I am at. I'm throwing so much effort into preparedness and trying to take care of my family that I'm starting to look back at my own interests and hobbies and wonder where and when I should dip back in for my own joy.</p>

        <p>Larger TV like 75 inch and larger are not in stock at least not in my province in Canada. A local owned audio/video store tried to order a Samsung 85 inch TV for me and after a month and half of them not knowing when they could get one in I gave up and ended up going to Best Buy and getting an 85 inch Sony TV. I would have rather liked to support a locally owned business than a big box store but they couldn't give me a straight answer as to when they could get a TV that size in stock.</p>

        <p>Yeah there's still plenty of TVs if you want something in the 55 inch to 75 inch size range. I wanted an 85 inch TV so it had to be special ordered.</p>

        <p>Yeah hobbies have shifted for sure. Now the wife and I are learning about gardening, canning, foraging, naturopathic remedies and I picked up the guitar. We had a serious talk that if this keeps up there are things we will likely never do again. Like flying, or movies, or visiting ski resorts.</p>
