    <strong>Why doomers hate us...</strong>
    <p><p>...because we're a constant reminder of how weak and stupid they are.  Subconsciously, they realize on some level that they're pathetic.  And when they see one of us, those subconscious insecurities come bubbling to the surface.  At that point, they have one of two choices.  Either they can confront their own weakness and stupidity or they can push those feelings of insecurity back down into their subconscious.  Naturally, being the weak, pathetic individuals that they are, they almost always choose the latter option.  But before they can do that, they have to destroy the source of their frustration somehow.  Hence the sputtering rage, the feigned superiority, the self-important exasperation, the risible projection.  Nothing more than an attempt to repress their own insecurities, to keep them buried deep inside, beneath a mountain of cognitive dissonance.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, I agree completely. Sometimes the things our brains do to protect our own ego are completely in opposition to understanding opposing points of view. Subconsciously we are always trying to maintain and protect our sense of reality, and we will lie to ourselves endlessly to uphold that reality. </p>
<p>If something doesn’t quite fit, or becomes a threat to our belief structure (think of a bunch of beliefs connected together in a web, each one interwoven with and dependent on other beliefs), it’s met with hostility and absolute rejection without consideration. Our need to maintain our existing view of reality is a much higher priority to our brain (because throughout most of our evolution it was essential for survival) than any of our desires for truth and understanding of what actually is.</p>
<p>That’s why scientific pursuits are so amazing to me, the process of science itself is counter-intuitive to the way we naturally think. If only the people who advocate “following the science” actually took their own advice and attempted to remove their ego and emotional investment from their argument, we might be able to agree on what’s going on and what we should do about it.</p>

        <p>This is wrong. I did a post a while back that was ignored about why they don’t care about our happiness and in a nut shell it was because they can’t actually do anything to help our situation without invoking massive painful change and so it’s easier to just not care and belittle.</p>
<p>The other part of that that I still need to post about is that whenever you have a portion of the population that is being subjugated in any way the rest of the population needs to see them as less than human to rationalize the state of their being.</p>
<p>That’s why so much media is centered around white people being bad. Whites pay the majority of taxes that feed into benefits. So the people that receive those benefits need to believe that whites are evil and so it’s ok for them to be stolen from.</p>
<p>It’s why republicans are demonized. Because they represent tradition and conserving values which is inconvenient to many and so the media tear them down and treat them as evil so that the rest of the people feel comfortable taking from them.</p>
<p>And it’s why we are treated as stupid and immoral. Like the other groups it’s about making us less than human so that when people think about us they don’t have to have empathy for our pains.  You lost your business? Doesn’t matter you’re not human so I don’t feel bad. Miss your family? Not human so what. Etc.</p>
<p>It’s all about making it so others don’t have to have empathy.</p>

        <p>Yep, it’s easy to make others inhuman with labels. “Anti-masker”, “covid-denier”, “anti-vaxxer”, etc. </p>
<p>Think “terrorist”, “criminal”, “rioter”. They’re all just ways to remove a particular group’s humanity to lessen our instincts toward showing them empathy.</p>

        <p>It’s not something they do on purpose, it’s literally their subconscious mind lying to them to protect what they think they know. Imagine if you had to walk through life constantly questioning all of your assumptions. I imagine it would actually make for some wonderful epiphanies and a deeper, more accurate understanding of the world, but at the cost of you being able to function in society. Our minds take huge shortcuts and require very, very little evidence to believe something.</p>

        <p>You're not doing it because you're compassionate.  You're perfectly comfortable ignoring the huge amount of suffering that COVID mitigation strategies have been causing.  You're perfectly comfortable remaining oblivious to all sorts of suffering.  The only reason you're doing these things is because you're a weak person following your programming.  In other words, you're only "concerned" because those with authority commanded you to be concerned.  Once they tell you to stop being concerned, your compassion will magically evaporate and you will go back to not caring at all about infectious diseases, just like in 2019.</p>

        <p>Nobody is telling me to be concerned. I just look around at various facts and decide that a degree of concern aligns with my overall worldview.

        <p>&rt; maybe I just didn’t overreact, but I didn’t make any large changes. I don’t consider not going to gatherings for a year to be a large change. I feel for people who are at higher risk and recognize that by me not becoming a vector, the pandemic will be over that much sooner. </p>
<p>&rt; the USA at least is hardly locked up. I know some countries have it worse though. </p>
<p>And this is all temporary, as it was for any number of historic pandemics. You get a year or two of disruptions and then it fades into the past.</p>

        <p>The difference is this is not temporary for the people who have sadly taken their own lives due to the isolation. This is not temporary for the people that are missing out on cancer screenings. This is not temporary for the millions of schoolchildren who are severely missing out on education. This is not temporary for the people who have put their lives into their small business only to see it in ruins and "unsalvageable".
This is not temporary for the people with autism who have their neccesary routines completely upended, people with ptsd, elderly who rely on social contact to give their lives meaning and any other number of vulnerable strata of society. So no it's not a temporary disruption that fades into the past and to suggest otherwise is at best naive.</p>

        <p>Those are extremely unfortunate “side effects” of the treatment, and I wish society was doing more for those victims. I can only speak for myself as someone with a stable job and somewhat introverted tendencies, but I know people who are underemployed and desperate for companionship and it’s tough because there’s only so much I, as an individual, can do. Like I’m not going to give all my salary to my unemployed friends or go on dates with them lol (I’m barely paying my own bills and am married). I’ve kept paying memberships at small businesses that are temporarily closed but that only goes so far for them. </p>
<p>How would you assign value to those people versus the additional ones who would die of covid if we had fewer restrictions and let it run completely rampant before obtaining vaccine coverage? Probably the easiest way to do this is assign an economic value to life....what numbers would you pick?</p>
<p>Because it really does come down to the least bad option 😞</p>

        <p>Feelings of protecting the common good are the reward your brain gives you for complying with government mandates that you had no input on. It’s a way for you to feel good about doing something that you might not want to do otherwise. It’s important for the decision makers in an organization to provide a little “out” like this to ensure compliance. </p>
<p>You’re able to say “I’m doing my part” even if it makes no measurable difference in the world, which allows you to go about your life and avoid cognitive dissonance.</p>

        <p>This is an excellent point and well made to boot, which guarantees it will be roundly ignored.</p>
