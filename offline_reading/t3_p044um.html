        <p>&rt;The important thing to remember is our approach, that we are currently running is diverting public health resources almost exclusively to Covid-19.  We have unfortunately, tragically, babies dying of congenital syphilis.  We have our childhood vaccination rates for other preventable childhood diseases dropping, putting us at risk of other vaccine preventable outbreaks. We have cancer screening rates lower.  There are other things that are a significant risk to Albertans and the longer we focus on Covid especially at this point in time when vaccines have again disrupted that automatic case to acute care ratio, again I would not believe I would be the best service to Albertans if I didn't look at that bigger picture and make recommendations looking at that bigger picture of how we utilize the people in our public health system for the best impact for everyone's health.</p>

<p>&rt;Local interventions where they're needed!</p>
<p>What a novel idea!  I live on Vancouver Island and we've had dick all cases, hospitalizations, or deaths this entire "pandemic".  The mandates placed province wide last year were completely based around the fact that Greater Vancouver was having a lot of cases, never-mind the fact that it's a gigantic province.</p>

        <p>Finally some common sense!  I may have to move to Alberta, if things get more dystopian in my province.</p>
