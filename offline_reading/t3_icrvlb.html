        <p>Trump or Biden - it doesn't matter. Everyone is pro-lockdown because it increases their power indefinitely. Neither are anti-lockdown. Trump is just an irresponsible coward who refuses to do anything, citing federalism. Biden is a Democrat, also a coward.</p>
<p>It is not like any of these people, or governors, will end any of this anytime soon, if ever.</p>

        <p>Uh, Governors (including many Democrats) blew up at Trump when he said he had the power to make them re-open.  If Trump doesn't have the power to re-open states, where would Biden get the power to close them down?  God help us all if this is the path he chooses.</p>

        <p>I think <em>most</em> red states will comply, especially the ones who locked down the first time. I can see some resistance from the likes of the Dakotas and Nebraska, and that could lead to Biden using "force".</p>

        <p>Yeah, definitely a bunch of cowards, but using force on one state will be a much bigger deal than the plan itself.  I also think there are some states whose people will not put up with it even if their Gov does.  Also, I could see red states saying, "ok, we're closing" and then doing zero to enforce it...much like some counties are doing in locked down states now.</p>

        <p>I think they had much more support for what they did in March.  The fatigue they've caused by dragging this out will be much more difficult to overcome if they try it again.  But, then again, I'm constantly surprised by the majority of the population living in complete fear of this virus so maybe they'll welcome it.  I'll be looking to move to Sweden.</p>

        <p>You have more faith in the populace than I do. Seems like their patience, to me at least, is not wearing as thin as I'd hoped by now. Yes, there are some that are sick of this, including most regulars in this sub, but the majority is still scared, and seem willing to do anything to "win the war against COVID".</p>
<p>Edit: This comment is being downvoted, and it astounds me that people still think everyone is "fatigued" when it seems like the only fatigue going on is happening in pockets. The population still hasn't hit any sort of critical mass on this yet.</p>

        <p>&rt;Uh, Governors (including many Democrats) blew up at Trump when he said he had the power to make them re-open.  </p>

        <p>He didn't (and doesn't) have that power in our system.  My point was, if Trump doesn't have the power to open the states, how would Biden have the power to close them?</p>
<p>Even with the federal "15 Days to Stop the Spread" ... it was a guideline that still needed the state Governors to buy in.  I'm hoping there would be more resistance to a new shutdown, but maybe I'm dreaming.</p>

        <p>It won't work because "truly essential " jobs go beyond grocery store workers/pharmacy/medical staff.  We found that out during the first shutdown when the majority of white collar jobs were the ones staying home.  Plus, people are fed up.  You might not see it in where you are but people have guns in my state and they're not on board for another shutdown.  I know that I just won't comply, much like the first time. I still hosted/went to parties and hung out in any open space that was available.  They would have to shoot me to keep me holed up inside at this point.</p>

        <p>NH.  Things are pretty good here in terms of things being open.  The only thing we can't seem to get around is masks.  Enough people are mask crazy so most of the stores require it.  I don't wear one outside and a lot of other people don't either.</p>

        <p>I would say that it's highly unlikely that we'll shut down again.  Compared to the rest of new England,(and a lot of the country) our shutdown was relatively short and not as strict.  Our governor also didn't roll back on opening things back up or reimposed restrictions once something reopened.   Our path has been a relatively straight forward one since the beginning of May and now practically everything is open.   That's not to say that we don't have scared people in our state who wished we were still shut down. Unfortunately, those people are everywhere.  However, the majority of people are living life as normal.  If you're serious about NH then I would highly recommend booking a trip and checking out the whole state to get a feel of the different areas.  It's a small state but the northern part of the state is very different than the southern part.</p>

        <p>I actually lived in NH for awhile 10 years ago. I was fresh out of college and wasn’t paying attention to anything and had no plans of settling down there. I was a newspaper reporter and it took me all over the state. I found the 4 seasons to be lovely, the towns were super quaint, and the people - especially the northern ones - to be salt of the earth and to match my personality style: very direct and without pretense, fierce to their foes but loyal to their friends. But it’s been 10 years since I’ve been there and I should in fact fly out. Now that I’m adult-y, I’m like hey that could be a nice place to raise a family and a nice place for the government to leave me the eff alone.</p>

        <p>Choice bits:</p>
<p>&rt; The most significant change in Biden administration Coronavirus policy from the Trump years will be the establishment of sound medical science, rather than inane Trumpean politics as the primary guiding factor in decision making.</p>
<p>&rt; Both Trump administration officials and Republican members of the Senate and House of Representatives have obscenely practiced an anti-science McCarthyism by their defamatory attacks against Dr. Anthony Fauci.  Those days of national nightmare will be over as of the Inauguration of President Joseph Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>&rt; Currently, the scientific community is overwhelmingly in support of a national lockdown plan devised by Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.  The details of the plan and the background are set forth in a column authored for the New York Times by Dr. Osterholm and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>&rt; The plan calls for a national uniformly stringent restrictive coordinated lockdown, state by state, for up to six weeks to crush the spread of the virus to less than one new case per 100,000 people per day.</p>
<p>&rt; The plan would mandate sheltering in place for everyone but the truly essential workers. People must stay at home and leave only for essential reasons: food shopping and visits to doctors and pharmacies while wearing masks and washing hands frequently.</p>
<p>&rt; I believe that given Biden’s determination to comply with sound science, he will issue as of January 21, 2021 Executive Orders enacting some variant of the Osterholm plan.  During the transition, he will lay the political groundwork for enactment of the plan, explaining to the American public why the plan is necessary and having advocates of the scientific community provide assurance that it will work.</p>
<p>&rt; The American public will be less than delighted about the economic pain resulting from the Osterholm Plan.  They are, however, likely to accept the assurances from Biden and Osterholm that the plan will work.  Accordingly, Biden will be able to proceed with the plan and guide it to conclusion, in spite of the fact that there will be other factors inherited from the Trump administration that will continue to afflict the economy, particularly the gargantuan Trump debt and deficits.</p>
<p>&rt; There is, however, one governor who will be severely politically impacted by a Biden national lockdown.  That governor is New Jersey’s Phil Murphy, who is up for reelection in November, 2021.</p>
<p>&rt; Murphy’s problem is that he previously imposed lockdowns of his own.  He showed great personal courage and integrity in doing so.  Phil Murphy demonstrated that he was willing to place health over wealth.</p>
<p>&rt; And the Murphy lockdowns were as successful as could be expected in flattening the curve and limiting the increases in new Covid cases.   They would have been more successful had other governors had Phil Murphy’s courage and principle and imposed lockdowns of their own.</p>
<p>&rt; Still, Phil Murphy is likely to take a hit in his approval ratings after the Biden lockdown.  He will prepare the New Jersey electorate for Biden’s forthcoming measure during the presidential transition.  Republicans, however, will excoriate Murphy for his previous lockdown, wrongfully claiming that it was unnecessary.</p>
<p>&rt; I have little doubt, however, that Phil Murphy will survive and be reelected.</p>
<p>&rt; By April, the Biden lockdown will have been completed, and its national success will have been established.  Murphy’s recovery in the polls will have begun.</p>
<p>&rt; And in the Fall, 2021, Biden will be campaigning effectively for Murphy’s reelection in New Jersey. Although the economy will continue to slump, in view of the debt and deficit nightmares bequeathed to him by Trump, Joe Biden will be a popular president, especially after maintaining a successful response to the Coronavirus.  His honesty and courageous anti-racism stance will make him a most pleasant change from the grossly mendacious, bigoted, and misogynist Donald Trump.</p>
<p>&rt; At the time of the Inauguration of Phil Murphy for a second term in January, 2022, the slogan will be, “New Jersey and Joe Biden – Perfect Together!”</p>
