    <strong>If you think coronavirus is being used as a weapon against the people you are right</strong>
    <p><p>There was an interesting interview looking into the use of behavioural psychology as a way for govts and bureaucracies to weaponize coronavirus.</p>
<p><a href="https://odysee.com/@triggernometry:b/fear-and-spin-government-manipulation-on:0">https://odysee.com/@triggernometry:b/fear-and-spin-government-manipulation-on:0</a></p>
<p>To summarize, govts are using psychological warfare against their citizens in order to control and manipulate societal responses.</p>
<p>In particular, there is a group borne out of the UK govt which has become very successful at advising those in power how best to generate compliance amongst the majority of the people they represent. The Behavioural Insights Team, or "The Nudge", originally a govt funded organization which is now privately run, advises govts on how to take advantage of perceived threats to the community in order to improve compliance of govt mandates. It started out as encouraging ppl to comply with mundane requirements such as paying tax on time or paying fines but has expanded into the use of "crises" to introduce draconian measures such as lockdowns and mask mandates.</p>
<p>One of its goals is to create division in society, effectively turning ppl against each other so that citizens become an extension of the govt's enforcement. Things like masks, which, despite having very little supporting evidence of their actual effectiveness of minimizing the spread of diseases, do work as a great psychological tool because they create both a fear in the community (if ppl are wearing masks this illness must be bad) and it also helps weed out those who do not comply (someone who refuses to wear a mask is the enemy).</p>
<p>None of this was ever about stopping coronavirus. In fact, coronavirus was the perfect excuse to implement many of the policies we are now seeing but which have probably been planned in some form for a while. While I doubt govts have a well thought out agenda, they are very good at taking advantage of something for short term gain and this is what we have seen over the past 18 months.</p>
<p>However, it is interesting to note that everything about this "pandemic" is an experiment in psychological manipulation and it isn't surprising that so many who think they are "well informed" are actually completely controlled by a well managed narrative.</p></p>

        <p>Now i understand why obama legalized propoganda back in 2012. ...  So it could be used in 2020.      Before 2020 i didn't really understand why it was necessary to do that..  maybe to cover up so covert wars in far away places but never expected it to be used on such a huge scale like covid and last over a year(s) while the data facts  are  kind of in plain sight for anyone that wants to find them, that refutes the nonstop propoganda.</p>

        <p>it moves man off our natural cycles, sets man outside of these cycles,.outside of Nature and not a part of the natural world.  i could spend a week writing on this, but here, to be succinct. we can use your example of moving us out of the moon phases.  </p>
<p>the gregorian 12 mOOnths takes man out of the natural rhythm of the moon.  pardon stating the obvious, but other than the sun, the moon has the greatest impact on all life on earth, it compresses and elongates the earth at its poles, acting as an impetus for a near endless list of phenomena on earth. while not proven, it is reasoned by some, that the human lymphatic and endocrine systems may be acted upon by the gravitational force of the moon as a pump on these emotional systems, which unlike the cardiac or pulmonary that have the heart and diaphragm to force circulation, the lymphatic and endocrine have no internal pumping mechanism. </p>
<p>think of the terms, lunatic or lunacy. or the mythology of werewolves.  clearly this is theory, but it is not irrational.  daily we witness massive tidal movment, why would fluids in the human body be any different, irrespective of the subltety of movement. </p>
<p>being "moved off the phases of the moon" we "forget" our conscious connection to these natural cycles and come to view ourselves as outside of the greater natural harmonic system at work.  so we abuse nature, consider ourselves to be its master,  which again, pardoning the obvious, is completely false. we see Nature as something we can control and manipulate as opposed to acting as good stewards and with due reverence. </p>
<p>our present "vaccine", is a great example, it attempts to "re-imagine" human mitochondrial dna, the essence of which is every bit as mysterious as the universe itself.  Nature is perfect, though we have no perception of its perfection.  </p>
<p>if we were in sync with the natural harmonics of moon cycles and other natural cycles, we would begin again to become conscious of our connection to, and participation within Nature, not its overlord.  </p>
<p>but over time we forget.. much like how i have to turn off spell checker, lest over time, i forget simple correct spelling.  </p>
<p>maybe a teribble example, but,  it is reddit larp'ing.</p>

        <p>i do not own shares of GME, but i hope moass happens as well, its not an impossible goal, and at the risk of sounding overly altrustic, it will stand as a testament, and a catalyst of change towards the greater good at least as a step.   </p>
<p>really when you think about it, moass's success or failure is only a battle of importance.  </p>
<p>whichever side determines their ends to be of greater importance, that side will claim victory.</p>

        <p>I am not convinced. The "sheep" calendar still has a ton of advantages, while anybody can life according to the moon calendar. Which was usual until just 50 to 100 years ago where I live. The problem is that this hypermodern society is norming everything and no defectors are allowed - even if their way of life does not touch anything else. Today in a literal sense: You could live like an hermit and never touch another human being but you <em>have to be vaxed</em>!</p>

        <p>I was loving WFH for a while, it's still pretty handy with a disabled wife and two young kids.</p>
<p>But my health has suffered massively. Going from 100 miles a week cycling to work and back and being on my feet all day, to sitting on my arse at home for 18 months, really has taken it's toll.</p>
<p>Not to mention the psychological ramifications of being isolated for so long.</p>
<p>I just feel sorry for single people, or even people in flats without even a garden.</p>
<p>Why are we letting it continue. I get how it all started and understand completely. I think even most of us were probably concerned back in 2019 when this started going round China. But the pandemic never materialised, I keep asking myself, am I the mad one? Why can noone else see what I'm seeing...</p>

        <p>I was working from home two years before COVID lol. Tech workers do not give a fuck because we already were at home well before the pandemic; any company that chooses to pay for a facility where work can be done at home, remotely, generally more effectively, is a failing company. </p>

<p>Most of this is designed to figure out who still needs to be "worn down."</p>
<p>A tactic often used is to intentionally make claims which are obviously fake and easy to disprove in order to identify who is easily manipulated and who is not.  I think they have been shocked at how many have been easily manipulated.</p>

        <p>I was one of these persons. While I took another vaccine, another way to say I am not anti-vax, I thought well let's have others take it before me (like my 91 year old, now dead grandma (for other reasons, just old...)) or my parents who think it is a good idea. </p>
<p>Now that being said I don't know anybody who accepted this as my opinion. "But you can go now, why are you waiting??" I just said, let those who need it more take it first, wait until fall because I am too young to be of any concern. "You're antivaxx, got it"</p>

        <p>I can kinda understand forced vaccinations for stuff like polio, whooping cough, and diseases like that because they will kill or cripple you. But if we’re going forced vaccinations it should be for all those diseases as well not just this corona virus</p>

        <p>That's the real anti-vax argument. </p>
<p>For example, we have all of these vaccines that have been tested and out for longer than my own lifetime. I have them all. Happily. I don't get flu shots, though, because I don't often get the flu either way. Its an added risk for something my body tends to handle on its without issue. </p>
<p>Maybe if this vaccine didn't rely on new tech (I'm always told its been decades in the making, but I still haven't seen a single example of an MRNA vaccine that's been through trials and approved), I'd personally be more receptive. I'm not against vaccines, or even rushed ones. I'm against forcing people to take them before our own government goes through the steps to say its safe. Instead, there are constant claims that the vaccine is 100% safe, etcetc, but where's the FDA Approval? Not that it would increase my trust at this point, the politicians and their rhetoric made sure of that.</p>
<p>Then there's this word "trust" thrown around regarding our doctors and scientists (big pharma, yo). Have we somehow forgotten the trust that should have been broken after the opioid crisis? My mind is boggled.</p>

        <p>I agree with you and the one constant with government is that they only care about them selves. Johnson &amp; Johnson had asbestos in I want to say baby powder for years or decades which caused cancer in people who used it. So I agree with not trusting bug pharmacy either because they tend to own the politicians and doctors to go with their stuff.</p>

        <p>And here's the scientist to back you up:</p>
<p>THURSDAY 5 AUGUST, 2021￼</p>

<p>HEIDELBERG</p>
<p>German chief pathologist sounds alarm on fatal vaccine injuries</p>
<p>The director of the Pathological Institute of the University of Heidelberg, Peter Schirmacher, has carried out over forty autopsies on people who had died within two weeks of their vaccination. Schirmacher expressed alarm over his findings.</p>
<p>Published: August 3, 2021, 12:42 pm</p>
<p>The regional daily Augsburger Allgemeine reported: “Schirmacher assumes that 30 to 40 percent of them died from the vaccination. In his opinion, the frequency of fatal consequences of vaccinations is underestimated – a politically explosive statement in times when the vaccination campaign is losing momentum, the Delta variant is spreading rapidly and restrictions on non-vaccinated people are being discussed.”</p>
<p>The Merkel administration quickly moved to respond to this “politically explosive” statement from Heidelberg. According to the German Press Agency (dpa), the Paul Ehrlich Institute announced that Schirmacher’s statements were “incomprehensible”. </p>
<p>The Chancellor’s lackey, senior German immunologist Thomas Mertens dismissed the findings right away: “I don’t know of any data that would allow a justifiable statement to be made here and I am not assuming an unreported number.”</p>
<p>The immunologist Christian Bogdan from the Erlangen University Hospital, member of the Standing Vaccination Commission (STIKO), also contradicted Schirmacher’s assumption of a “high number of unreported vaccination complications or even deaths”.</p>
<p>The pathologist however received support from his own ranks, and the Federal Association of German Pathologists stated that more autopsies of vaccinated people who died within a certain time frame after vaccination should be performed.
The head of the “Autopsy Working Group” in this association wanted to make general practitioners and health authorities aware of this. In other words, doctors of the patients who die within a few days or weeks after vaccination should apply for an autopsy in case of doubt or the health authorities should take action.</p>
<p>The Federal Association of Pathologists had already requested this in March in a letter to Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU), but it went unanswered.</p>
<p>Schirmacher’s warning could of course ruin a multi-digit long-term billion-dollar business for various pharmaceutical companies, while the already low willingness to get the jab in the remaining unvaccinated group could further decrease dramatically and ultimately the entire pandemic strategy of the federal government could unravel.</p>
<p>But the seriousness and reputation of the director of the Pathological Institute at the University of Heidelberg are unassailable.</p>
<p>Schirmacher himself is already leading an autopsy project on people who have died from Covid-19, which is subsidized by the state. He himself then expanded the focus and also autopsied more than 40 deceased vaccinated people. Even if his results are only a snapshot, it is a dramatic one: 30 to 40 percent died from the vaccination itself. The pathologist cited “rare, severe side effects of the vaccination – such as cerebral vein thrombosis or autoimmune diseases”.</p>
<p>Schirmacher responded to the criticism from some colleagues. He denied a lack of competence: “The colleagues are definitely wrong because they cannot assess this specific question competently.” Moreover, he has not tried to spread panic, and he is not an opponent of vaccinations – Schirmacher himself has been vaccinated.</p>
<p>The Robert Koch Institute meanwhile refers to the regular safety reports of the Paul Ehrlich Institute on its website. However, should it become apparent in the coming weeks that politics, science and the media are campaigning against Schirmacher and his alarming results are being completely ignored, it would be another red flag regarding the safety of the products.</p>
<p>Twitter meanwhile suspended the account of former New York Times science correspondent Alex Berenson for sharing details of a Pfizer clinical trial with similar findings which completely obliterates the narrative of the political establishment.</p>
<p>According to Pfizer: “During the blinded, controlled period, 15 BNT162b2 and 14 placebo recipients died; during the open-label period, 3 BNT162b2 and 2 original placebo recipients who received BNT162b2 after unblinding died. None of these deaths were considered related to BNT162b2 by investigators.” It stated that the causes of death were balanced between BNT162b2 and placebo groups: 15 people who took the vaccine died and 14 people who took the placebo died.</p>
<p>But tons of people who were in the placebo group have now taken the jab, thus “the trial blind is broken now” and “this is all the data we will ever have,” Berenson pointed out.</p>

        <p>Yes, people still discuss the facts of the scamdemic and how it was used to coerce people into giving up their freedom and liberty in a way that was never justified.</p>
<p>People also realize that the mask is only a tool to separate the compliant from the non compliant and instill fear in the weak minded.  This was punctuated by Obamas mask free birthday party.</p>

        <p>People in power have so much money that they wouldn't really care about the economies of countries. Those people care about power and money cannot literally always buy power.</p>
<p>Also the rich don't get poorer during crisises. They have enough money saved to survive and invest during those times. Small businesses close and people are evicted, rich can buy up property and resources for cheap and start earning money on them during the good times. Also owning property and land and means of manifacturing gives quite a lot of power. Do I need to explain further? I'm quite lazy :D</p>

        <p>&rt; it isn't surprising that so many who think they are "well informed" are actually completely controlled by a well managed narrative.</p>
<p>Indeed it isn't, I see it all around me in otherwise intelligent people. But this manipulation is impossible to miss when you start spotting the evasions, the omissions, the inconsistencies, the contradictions and occasionally the blatant untruths.</p>

        <p>Well obviously the governments all over the globe made a lot of mistakes. Pretty much trial by error. Nobody has had the perfect solution as of now. The problem was that they acted like they did have a clue what they were doing. But thats politics 101, as sad as it is. We feel safer if we believe our leaders know what theyre doing.</p>
<p>Governments are obligated to protects its citizens. So acting not at all would be a catastrophe and probably lead to total chaos and certain death. Even Trump realized that he had to act after realizing that he couldnt play it down anymore</p>

        <p>Actually, they tried it back in 2008. Remember when they crashed the economy? Then they came up with the swine flu vaccine in 2009. Yet, most didn't care because everyone was busy with the outcome of the financial crisis. That and the effort of some doctors that called it for it for what it was BS, saved many lives. So they learned a lot by the mistakes they've done back then. Now they started with the disease first, almost everybody seemed to fall for it because the economy has been fine, at least that's what they made us believe. Meanwhile they tried the basic income stuff (stimulus), divided society into "essential vs non essential" and basically trained those who've been labeled as "non essential" to take the stimulus and shut up. Additionally they've spread distrust all over the place. Who is going to trust the medical science, the jurisdiction or even the educational system, let alone politics from now on? And that's their whole plan. Divide and conquer all over the place. The scary part? That's basically the plan to implement the NWO or whatever one would call it. We have to reject every single BS that's going on, no matter how hard they'll hit us with further restrictions, suppression and so on, we should stop obeying this BS immediately.</p>

        <p>That thing was a normal exercise in industry pork. Back then they scared the experts who pressured governments. It was a true industry subsidy. But today they have to go through everybody with it it seems.  </p>
<p>And also, this:<br>
&rt;Professor David Salisbury, Head of Immunisation at the UK Department of Health said the vaccines with adjuvants offer good protection even if the virus changes over time; "One of the advantages with adjuvanted vaccines is their ability to protect against drifted (mutated) strains. It opens the door for a whole new strategy in dealing with flu."</p>

        <p>More 'diverse' societies have less social cohesion and lower levels of social trust, solidarity, and capital. There are a lot of knock-on effects to this but the short explanation is that people like each other less the less they have in common, so it's more difficult to oppose a unified elite.</p>

        <p>"Yao Ming is so tall, how can you say Chinese people are shorter than Europeans?"</p>
<p>First of all you're comparing apples and oranges because one is an (ostensibly) liberal democracy and the other is based on authoritarian marxist-leninist-maoism.</p>
<p>Secondly your motivated reasoning (from reaching a conclusion then retroactively trying to justify it) is what's making you wrong and unable to accept the <em>glaringly</em> obvious reality that people who have nothing in common tend not to get along as well as people who do. It's not <em>'my premise,'</em> it's reality. I'm almost sorry I cited that Putnam study because this is just "sky is blue" levels of obvious.</p>
<p>Finally there's an argument to be made that the Chinese government is significantly more responsive and beneficent than the American government. This would be an interesting conversation to have if you were earnestly curious and asking your questions in good faith</p>

        <p>I think a multicultural liberal democracy is more free than an ethically homogeneous authoritarian society. I value freedom so this metric is important to me. I look at the evidence and I think multiculturalism and ethnic diversity create stronger societies. My evidence for this is the strongest economic, military, and political power on Earth is very multicultural. The most powerful military on Earth is multicultural. </p>
<p>All ethnically homogeneous societies on the planet right now are weaker than the multicultural super power that is the United States. This indicates to me that multiculturalism is the route to the greatest degree of prosperity.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, what evidence did you provide for any of your claims? You're equally guilty if what you're claiming I did. You said an ethnically homogeneous society is less easily controlled. That's an argument you may feel to be intuitively true based on your personal opinion but you provided no evidence of that. I pointed to an example where that is the opposite of the case. The US, a multicultural society, has more freedom and less government control than an ethnically homogeneous society like china where the government exercises greater control and grants citizens fewer freedoms. </p>
<p>My argument has been that ethnostates are weaker than multicultural states. My evidence for this was the US's relative power compared to that of more ethnically homogeneous societies. That's a pretty easy argument to comprehend. Not exactly sure why you're having a hard time with it.</p>
<p>Your argument is just your opinion too dude. At least I provided an example of a multicultural society outperforming an ethnically homogeneous society. You don't seem to have a counter. You seem to just be retreating.</p>

        <p>This is probably the worst thing I've ever seen. 100 years from now when I'm dying on a hospital bed and I'm asked what my biggest regret was it will be that I turned on my internet and scrolled through the internet on that fateful day... I will never be able to recover from this. No amount of therapy will save me. No amount of prescription pills will let me recover. I am a shell. This memory is so bad my brain is physically rejecting it and now I have a headache every time I think about it. Why did you post this, thinking it was a good idea? You've permanently ruined my life because of this, I hope you're happy. I hope that one day this gets branded as a war crime and you get hauled off to prison, never to see the light of day again. The fact that you're already not in a psych ward for insanity is so baffling I have lost all faith in every kind of justice system. If you subscribe to any religion, you'd best spend the rest of your time atoning for this ultimate sin. Have a terrible day, I hope this creation of yours haunts you in your dreams.</p>

        <p>It’s time to wake up.  If you’ve been waiting for something to actually motivate people to get off their asses and stop being cowards, here’s what’s going to happen:</p>
<p>You’re already seeing the vaccines fail to accomplish their task.  At 16% effectiveness at 6 Months, it is a total failure.  Barring side effects and placebos alone.</p>
<p>You're quickly seeing that the masks will not be enough, we’ve known since Fauci himself told us last year they weren’t enough, and no amount of blockading will ever change that.</p>
<p>You’re already seeing Covid narration start up again, with more and more censorship popping up on Reddit, in spite of even the mainstream media touting the return of King Coof despite “mandatory vaccination.”  Some People try as hard as they can to control information, but that never works.  If you found this place after a ban?  You’re not alone.</p>
<p><strong>This all means we'll need another lockdown too.  That’s an important checkpoint.</strong></p>
<p>In the United States alone, more houses than ever have been sold in the past two years.</p>
<p>That means:  <strong>billions of dollars in mortgages</strong> taken out over the past two years.  When the second lockdown starves this economy, Mortgagers who overpaid $20,000+ for their homes will start to foreclose because as people lose jobs, their property value plummets.  People aren’t going to hold a $340,000 loan for a $270,000 house - it is just not feasible.  2008 Recession, times ten.</p>
<p>I don’t even need to go into small business being run out of business - Corporate powerhouses are just biding their time as they dream to buy up their former competition.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why Blackrock got such a hard on for the rental industry?  Millions of these foreclosing customers will be forced to rent from the newly refurbished Real Estate Rental system, owned largely by massive conglomerates like Blackrock.  They’ll be able to charge as much as they want to, because everyone will want to work hard to recover their “bruised” credit rating.</p>
<p>You're living in a new world.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTaNzAfbkC8">A diet Shasta world.</a></p>
<p>The question is, when people start seeing this happen, and start puking in their mouths as they realize Covid was the biggest contributing factor in reinvigorating what is essentially Medieval Feudalism - will a system like this be able to stand against people who are very much aware they’ve been played?</p>

        <p>If you want the right solution - approximately one year ago we should’ve suspended ALL international travel, and then locked down the country for approximately three months (maximum).</p>
<p>That includes so-called <em>”essential businesses”</em> like real estate, consulting and finance.  Put the military in charge of grocery delivery and reimbursed the stores for exact value, and paid all <strong>actual</strong> essential workers $35 an hour with daily testing.  Pushed forward trials of potential “cures” to a wider market instead of suppressing them.  Paid every individual family a minimum monthly stimulus of $2,000.00 to $6,000.00 depending on their monthly expenses - not poverty, but “expenses.”  (Should’ve given money to the people of the United States instead of bail out Corporations.)</p>
<p>As soon as it was over?  The economy would’ve bounced back.</p>
<p>Instead?  Trump half-assed everything.  Now Governments across the world are talking about making these vaccines “mandatory,” and we have a problem.</p>
<p>It was never about doing the right thing - we’re now locked into doing the wrong thing, over and over again, expecting the situation to normalize.</p>
<p>It won’t, and making people madder and madder while the economy prepares to collapse in on itself will only lead to a situation so fucked up, there is no way out.</p>
<p>Nobody listened a year ago, and even fewer people would listen today.  We had one chance - and blew it.  Either we let people decide for themselves and proceed back to pre-Covid lifestyles with the risk of a more dangerous flu for older folks - or we push people until they’ve had enough.</p>
<p>That’s the situation we’re looking at.  Surely, you understand.</p>

        <p>Oh - and it would nice if we still have 99.5% deaths prevented by vaccine.  (Not 99.5% of cases - the virus still gets around - but 99.5% of deaths).</p>

        <p>I got banned for citing the CDC and US governments own COVID stats --that if you crunch the case/death rate the survival rate (even if you're unvaxxed) is 99.8%, almost 100% if you're vaccinated.  PERMANENT BAN</p>
<p>That was the first time I've ever been banned for anything. </p>
<p>I also got banned from another subreddit for disagreeing with YouTube's ban of SkyNews, when they had a clip debating the effectiveness of masks. I made a polite, civil comment stating banning a different opinion is bad for democracy --that a different opinion isn't necessarily "misinformation" = PERMANENT BAN</p>

<p>Remember, they hit us with CASES! CASES! CASES!</p>
<p>Well, it seems all those positive "cases" (net of those who died WITH covid) now have a robust immunity, reportedly better even than only-vaccinated people.</p>
<p>Sounds like the herd immunity threshold has well been exceeded.</p>
<p>Their 2020 CASES! bullshit campaign is now being used against them. They couldn't manage to keep all of those plates spinning at the same time.</p>

        <p>She just probably doesn't understand technical, it's hard for some people. I only care and want to help that's all. This is heading us down a very dark path and Anthony Fauci is leading the way. Medical practitioners only know what they what they know. I'll bring this up to my GP on my next appointment, he deserves to know for the sake of his patients.
 I learned that in 2008 when they told me I should receive seven weeks radiotherapy for head and neck cancer with a grim prognosis, giving me 8-10 months chance of survival. I opted out, came home and learned how to cure it myself. So you can see why I do what I do. I wish you and yours the best in health.</p>

        <p>Its not even about it being too technical. She just flat out didn’t want to hear it. Ignorance is bliss. It would be very interesting to see how a doctor or anyone actually refutes this. My bet is it will be labelled  a conspiracy and ignored.
Cheers! All the best</p>

        <p>If you want to get religious about it, the Bible says even the elect will be deceived.</p>

        <p>You being denied an ICU bed is not a "weapon" it is just fact and reality. The hospitals are full. Arkansas has zero beds in their ICU yesterday and if you had a heart attack or some other emergency situation, you would have to be airlifted out of state to another hospital.</p>

        <p>Well, the USA just had 3,200 covid deaths in the past week. Of those deaths probably 3,150 were unvaccinated. </p>
<p>During a typical fly year the flu kills about 692 people a week, and 3150/692 = 4.55 which means this strain of covid is about 4.5 times more deadly than the flu to unvaccinated people (350% more deadly).</p>
<p>If we did the opposite calculation and only looked at vaccinated deaths (even though that number would definitely be smaller if everyone got vaccinated), 50/692 = .0722, which would mean this strain of covid is only 7% as deadly as the flu for vaccinated people.  7% is a lot less than 350%, wouldn't you agree? </p>
<p>It's just unfortunate that so many of you are so brainwashed because it's you guys that are all dying.  </p>
<p>I wanted to ask, are you pro-choice or pro-life. I'm going to take a wild guess and say you are pro-life. So wouldn't a pro-life person want to do everything they can to save the lives of 3,000 people every week?</p>

        <p>So is this arguing that some tiny ubiquitous thing belonging to every government on earth transmits the corona virus into the water supply and cause psychological manipulation?</p>
<p>Does that pretty much sum up what this complaint is about?  </p>
<p>Do they run some kind of subscription service?  So for example like some guy who works for the government of Portugal decides to get a copy of the COViD subscription to feed into the water supply?  </p>
