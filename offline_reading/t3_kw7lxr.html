    <strong>For The First Time During This Whole "Pandemic" I Am Legitimately Terrified</strong>
    <p><p>I am fucking sweating with fear over being forced to take the vaccine. I'm no anti-vaxxer but this shit is more rushed than the end of Game of Thrones. I feel like I'm in fucking Jonestown, being forced to drink the Kool-Aid, honestly.</p>
<p>I'll be upfront and tell you right off the bat that I'm deathly afraid of needles. The thought of the tip scraping against or breaking off in a bone in my arm fills me with fucking dread and makes me feel like I'm gonna pass out. But fuck my fear and mental health, right? It's not like I've been forced to spend near a year locked inside, isolated from everyone and muzzled up to placate your fear or anything. Oh, wait.</p>
<p>But what's really making me fucking scared is the reports I'm seeing of people suffering horrible symptoms afterwards, or (and maybe I'm wrong here, please, please, please correct me if I am) outright dropping dead within 28 days of receiving it. I mean, if you're going to count a death from a car accident as COVID just because they had the virus 28 days ago then the vaccine should get the same treatment, surely?</p>
<p>Why should I have to fucking take it? If the elderly, vulnerable and doomers gleefully offer up their arms to be prodded then why the fuck should I have to? I'm not being selfish. I'm only putting my life in danger; unless you're telling me the vaccine doesn't work? In which case, what the fuck's the point?</p>
<p>This shit is going to be made mandatory, calling it now. We're going to be forced to take this, and I really, really don't want to. I would rather take my chance with the virus that has a 99.7% survival rate, not risk it with a vaccine so untested they don't even know the long term side effects or whether you can still transmit the virus after taking it, requiring you to still wear a mask and socially distance.</p>
<p>It is fucking selfish of you to demand and peer pressure me into putting something inside my own body that I don't want. My body, my fucking rules. It shouldn't fucking concern you. You've already stripped one year from my life, what more do you fucking want?</p>
<p>I guarantee doomers will read this, curl a small cunty smirk on their fat, greasy faces and laugh at how fucking terrified I am and for questioning "the science", despite having begrudgingly followed all the bullshit arbitrary rules and regulations up this point for their fucking benefit. Again, I ask: IF YOU'VE TAKEN THE VACCINE AND ARE "SAFE", WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO?</p></p>

        <p>I'd rather quit my job and struggle to figure out how to pay my bills and eat than get that shot. Rather pull my kid out of school and struggle figuring that out. I'm not sure what I'll do if it becomes mandatory here. I've stopped thinking about it so I don't go insane. I'll shit myself when it happens and not any sooner than that.</p>

        <p>I feel similarly to you, so you’re not alone here. I have a fear of needles too, I get anxious and throw up if I have to get one. And I absolutely hate the social isolation we are being forced into. I can’t even visit with family right now. It’s damaging to everybody’s health and wellbeing, but nobody cares.</p>
<p>It really scares me how fast they have rolled this vaccine out. With such a high incidence of unpleasant side effects, you know there is something wrong here. Studies are not looking for the possible dangers, and people are being tricked into believing this vaccine is perfectly safe when we don’t even know what the long term effects will be. And most people are not even at risk for the virus in the first place! It doesn’t make any sense at all.</p>
<p>I believe TPTB are going to make this vaccine mandatory, in the sense that you will be required to take it in order to live a normal life. So, for things like employment, travel, education, entering stores, etc... you will have to show proof of vaccination. In that way, the government won’t be breaking down your door to force you to take it, but you will be left with no choice.</p>
<p>I’m not certain what the solution to all of this is, but please take care of yourself so you’ll be strong enough to fight back. You deserve it.</p>

        <p>Haha, don't forget, they may be a totalitarian regime pushing the agenda of globalist elites, but they are still the government. The very first day the app is released, I guarantee someone will release a spoof app or a way to get around it.  Someone did it already with the NHS track and trace app. The government are completely incompetent with tech, I mean our UK government 'lost' 10s of thousands of test results because they stored them in Excel 95, ffs. I can't think of a single government IT project that has run on time, within budget and actually worked at the end of it.  Clearly they will not be making a foolproof system anytime soon.</p>

        <p>They may try to make it mandatory but I don't think it is possible to actually follow through on it.</p>
<p>At least in the US, there are too many armed civilians who will happily die on this hill. We outnumber them by an immense ratio. The only way they can force you is by coercion. </p>
<p>Ultimately if you refuse and hold up in your house, they will have to send someone in after you, and it will be difficult to find someone willing to die just to get a needle in your arm.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying you or anyone else should get the vaccine. But with all kindness, I want to point out that you are sort of a doomer yourself, but in the reverse. Assuming the worst about the vaccine situation and then working yourself into a panic about it. I think you are borrowing trouble, so to speak.</p>
<p>Just like the Covid-doomers focus on the worst case scenario Covid cases, vaxx-doomers do the same in focusing on the worst case scenario outcomes of the vaccine, ignoring all the people who take the vaccine and it's no big deal. </p>
<p>For me personally, I find it hard to imagine there will ever be enough doses of the vaccine available for people who actually want it, never mind for people who don't. It's going to take a loooong time to get even 50% of the population vaccinated, and by that time a year will have passed and it will be time to start revaccinating, as it will require an annual update.</p>
<p>Eventually people will figure out that people who don't want Covid can get vaccinated, and anyone else, it's on them to deal with the illness - no more lockdowns and sacrifices to protect the vulnerable, they can protect themselves with vaccinations. Public health officials don't give a single damn whether you, I, or any other particular person, gets sick. They only care about the overall numbers. Eventually between voluntary vaccinations, natural immunity post-infection, and mutations to a less deadly strain (that's what these viruses tend to do over time) it will no longer be a major public health crisis.</p>
