        <p>It helps, yes.  I'm married to a bio phd/prof, and I consult her daily on this crap (and she in turn consults her textbooks and papers, because this isn't common by any stretch).  Anyone who says "listen to random doctors and nurses" is failing to realize that even the average medical professional isn't doing this research.</p>

        <p>It sounds intimidating, but they're just part of the outside covering for the virus, like armor. It helps with attacking cells. Proteins are building blocks for thousands of biological structures, and these are shaped like spikes. The <em>vaccines</em> produce just the spikes to train your immune system to fight them. This current debate here is that the production is not controlled and excess are leaked out of the body.</p>

        <p>They are a small part of the virus found on the outside. It's what the virus uses to bind to our cells so it can infect them. That's why they used that for the vaccine, it can only change so much before it can't bind to our cells anymore</p>

        <p>Not exactly it's what the virus uses it to get inside our cells by tricking them into thinking is something it actually needs. On its own the Spike Protein is completely harmless, it can't infect cells nor can it produce viruses. To do that you need the whole viral genome of the virus to be injected into your cells so they can run it.</p>

        <p>This does seem to be the conclusion.  With such high doses in the vaccines, spike proteins would be present in the same saliva everyone is worried about spreading sc2 itself.  Skin contact seems....unlikely, but aersolised saliva and mucous in breaths/sneezes/coughs are absolutely plausible.</p>

        <p>Yeah so I went on a bach party with a bunch of girls who have been vaccinated (stayed in the same house, slept in the same bed as some of them, shared drinks, etc). While there two days in a row I had truly horrendous stomach cramping but thought maybe it was alcohol or eating shitty food (and maybe so, but I have also never experienced anything quite like this) and then four days later developed a bad cold that lasted 10 days and counting. I haven't been sick since I had covid in March 2020. </p>
<p>What I want to know is how serious this is for those of us that are exposed to it. Could you just experience various side effects from exposure to the spike proteins for a period of time but then normalize when you flush them from your body? Or do we turn into spike protein producing factories just from being exposed? I don't know how it could be the latter but truly nothing would surprise me these days.</p>

        <p>What? 88 days is surely long enough to trial a vaccine tech that never made it anywhere close to out of trial prior to the "pandemic". </p>
<p>You can know so much about a vaccine in 88 days. Look how much they know about SARS-CoV-2 in well over a year's time. They don't know diddly after all this time on the virus, but they got it all just right after 88 days with the vaccine? No.</p>

        <p>Exactly,  if after a year where still are sure how Covid 19 started and possible long term effects then how can they claim the vaccine is safe if we are unsure of how the whole pandemic started.   And I wanna see research on those patient with Covid 19 in the beginning antibody status 1 year later...why is know asking about those people with Covid 19 infection in the beginning immune response 1 year later?    If u follow the science,  that a should be researched and reported so then a true herd immunity return to normal can be discussed.    And I also want to know why we only are allowed to have one individual allow to give any information about Covid19 to the US.    The US has how many physician and researchers but yet we only get the information through one filter....I like to hear from those physician that sat through the last 2 congressional hearing last year.</p>

        <p>So help me with this, I have asked other friends of mine that I consider smarter than me that work in the medical field. And this goes into the vaccinated being the asymptomatic spreaders. The early data shows that it will reduce symptoms or you won't show any symptoms at all, correct? But there has been no data showing that you can not still transmit it, or at least no rock hard data, because the answer i always get is "its too early to say yet".  If that is the case that it still spreads, will the next mutation of it be even worse ?</p>

        <p>Interesting that taking a "vaccine" magically prevents the natural and completely seperate process of viral shedding. If you're vaccinated and contract a viral disease, you would shed viral material. Live/attenuated viruses for H1N1 <em>(a coronavirus)</em> and Influenza shed from vaccinated individuals.. </p>
<p><em>unsure what the science of synthetic substitutes is, I'd assume its similar to a splinter which is expelled from your body since it isn't natural. Or, like Pharma says: the vaccine makes your cells a viral warehouse pumping out proteins, it is simply irresponsible to assume that isn't shed in some fashion.</em></p>
<p>Or we can look at the study of how SARS-CoV-2 antibodies showed cross reactivity with 28 of 55 human tissue samples (aka autoimmune disorder) which could then be shed or expelled. Your body is constantly shedding and renewing <em>(all cells replaced within a decade, and all skin cells replaced within a month)</em></p>
