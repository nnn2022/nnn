    <strong>What made you decide to not hold back on how you feel when speaking to others?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m having a difficult time getting the courage to speak my mind about how I feel about coronavirus and everything surrounding it. When people talk about it in a positive way, I don’t agree with them, I just say nothing. But I want to speak about how I feel because I know I’ll feel better and won’t have to worry about what people think because I’ve put my beliefs out there and will know how they feel. </p>
<p>The thing is, the job I work in every single co worker is extremely pro mask, social distancing all that and if a customer comes in with no mask they all flip out immediately and a couple times I’ve had coworkers complain to me when a customer mentions how masks are stupid. They’ll call them names and say awful things and I’m worried if I speak my mind they’re going to create a hostile work environment or just not talk to me at all. But then I think about how I need to just set that fear aside and push past it.</p>
<p>I guess my question is does anyone have any advice?</p></p>

        <p>Knowing your audience is absolutely key.</p>
<p>I live in the craziest, most authoritarian-left city in America, San Francisco. I am very vocal with my coworkers, neighbors, and friends about my opposition to lockdowns, and I believe I have been successful in convincing people that something is wrong without making them hate me.</p>
<p>In my case, the key is to appeal to the other person's sense of justice. I talk about how lockdowns hurt the disadvantaged the most and how they're enabling the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in history. Your sense of empathy has to be on full display for these people, or else you'll quickly turn into a Trump-supporting grandma-killer in their eyes.</p>

<p>You know how to do it.  You have adjust your argument so that it appeals to their beliefs.  Most people don't know how to do this.</p>

        <p>I’ve tried the tactic of talking about the issues lockdowns cause, but the answer is almost always, “it’s trump’s fault”. Either he didn’t give businesses enough money or he didn’t put in a national lockdown/mask mandate. </p>
<p>I’ve had some success with pointing out hypocrisy and inconsistencies in the mandates.</p>

        <p>I have never met anyone in real life who would support or appreciate lockdowns and restrictions. Yes, a lot of people are scared, so the best tactic against fear is to use humor, like, "Yes, because we all know that COVID goes out after 9 pm/attack you in bars/etc!".</p>
<p>People usually start laughing and you can see how a lot of them are confused about what is going on.</p>
<p>So instead of being aggressive with my opinion, I try to make people around me to question what is really going on, if it makes sense. Sorry for my English. </p>
<p>We are frustrated... I get it. But we need to still educate those around us. It is a war, media vs real people, and we will lose if we give up so quickly. Need to act wisely.</p>

        <p>Don’t state your own opinions. Use the papers and remarks of credible people that are backed up by science. I’m Canadian so I can only speak about my own country but I have the facts and numbers from the government to back up what I’m saying. Also, I have a report that destroys the PCR test and proves this is all a fraud. If anyone is interested in either I’ll make an edit and post links.</p>

        <p>Report by the Justice center posted on dec 3. Shows that deaths haven’t gone up, covid hasn’t affected elderly deaths (even tho on 11/15 CTV said only 166 deaths in Canada have been outside nursing homes), deaths in other categories (cancer, heart disease etc) are down (labelled as covid deaths), suicides up, overdoses up by 52% in BC compared to last year and covid deaths aren’t even 1/5 of the overdose deaths. Plus a lot more, all with links to government stats. Enjoy</p>

        <p>I’ve been called a conspiracy theorist for showing people cdc numbers here in the us. </p>
<p>Most of the time when I try to show people the data, I get told “there’s so much we still don’t know”. Numbers and research don’t seem to matter to most people, because I’m not a journalist or a politician. A lot of scientists who oppose the response are also getting smeared, which leads to people not believing any opposing studies. </p>
<p>I say, keep up the fight, though. Some people will listen. There have been a few people I talked to who seemed slightly persuaded. Not trying to be a negative nancy.  I’m just dismayed at the lack of success myself and others have had trying to convince people with data.</p>

        <p>The report about the PCR test is authored by a ton of microbiologists, virologists and doctors, plus the ex head of Pfizer Uk and a guy who holds patents for PCR and DNA amplification and sequencing. So they know what they’re talking about. And if you can’t agree with me on that, then they’re the conspiracy theorist.</p>

        <p>This comment made me realize, or rather be reminded of the fact that humanity has come so far in terms of technological advancements, yet we still behave like cavemen in many aspects. Maybe if we ever find a way to set our differences aside and work together we might achieve our next step in evolution, maybe we just have these primal instincts hardcoded into our DNA and we can't help it, or maybe we just enjoy conflicts and hardships because it adds some purpose to our lives. I don't know, I guess it's all up for debate.</p>

        <p>I can’t keep my mouth shut and I’m not scared of confrontation. I don’t enjoy confrontation, but I don’t shy away from it. I’ve lost friends and a job because of it, but I have my values intact. </p>
<p>I would end up defending the people without masks - as calmly as possible, but this could lead to an argument. Sometimes the best way to make people realize they’re being stupid, is with humor. Joke about things-about the inconsistencies. Just don’t outright verbally attack the pro-fear people. </p>
<p>Your chances of converting anyone are very low. People are very set in their ways on this. Until the tv and social media tells them masks and lockdowns are stupid, they’ll continue to believe in it.</p>

        <p>Same exact situation at my job. I eventually started sharing my opinion more and more, trying not to come off too cynical or negative, &amp; some ended up understanding parts. However I still wound up quitting/getting fired cuz I refuse to wear a mask. I feel great since I'm being true to myself and not living a lie. You are who you surround yourself with, remember</p>

        <p>&rt; I’ve had coworkers complain to me when a customer mentions how masks are stupid.  </p>
<p>Explain to them they are damaging to health. If in doubt ask them to sprint wearing one vs not wearing one.  Here is a demo</p>
<p>Check how the police folds, after running for few seconds</p>

<p>They can't run. So if something detriments physical performance it's clearly damaging to health. It's common sense.</p>

        <p>Yeah that’s tough, tribal mentality is stronger than ever so for your own sanity make sure you get plenty of time away from the riff raff.  If asked, I’m honest and upfront even if it is against the grain, as long as I can stay composed while the other person(s) have an aneurism, I know Im respecting myself.
Seize the moments where you can be a stronger person, following the crowd because it’s easy is still a capitulation. There are more of us than we think, it’s just a matter of courage.</p>
