    <strong>Why do doomers and social media platforms care what we say?</strong>
    <p><p>If we're all so "crazy" and spread "misinformation" as a small group, why would these doomers be getting so worked up about what we are saying? Why are they trying to get our subreddit banned? </p>
<p>That's like getting mad at a mentally ill homeless person walking up to you and telling you that every human has two heads. What do you do? Ignore their banter because their obviously a nutjob, right?</p>
<p>But that's NOT what we're seeing. These doomers are going out of their way to troll in this sub 24/7. Other reddit groups are randomly banning people for being subscribed to or being associated with NNN. </p>
<p>This question is aimed at all of the doomers and other reddit groups. What are you really scared of? That this sub is growing? That we might convert some people to our way of thinking? </p>
<p>Logically you shouldn't be scared of anything unless you KNOW we are making some really damn good arguments. We shouldn't be making waves if everything we say is complete gibberish.</p>
<p>By the way, there is no such thing as "misinformation". There's just INFORMATION and how people choose to perceive that information. Every. Single. Person. has an ulterior motive behind what they do and say. It's usually to benefit their own self interest. Especially when it comes to the government and media. To think otherwise means that you just don't know human behavior. Do you honestly think an organization that steals your money every year through taxes really has your best interest at heart? </p>
<p>This sub has one goal. Finding the truth and protecting the truth. What's so bad about that? There's always two sides of every story. Why do you not want to question the science? If we didn't question science, then it wouldn't really be science then would it? </p>
<p>In a healthy debate, you don't discredit relevant information and you don't censor the ability to bring about new information. </p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen you tear¬†out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only¬†telling¬†the world that you fear what he might¬†say.‚Äù</p>
<p>We're so tiny compared to other reddit groups that have millions of members. You want to ban little ol' me? Why? Once again, what are you afraid of? üòâ</p></p>

<p>Because its a "infectious disease" and much like "climate-change" the idea is that your actions hurt others. Basically we are all dangerous killers because we dont vaccinate and use electrical power.</p>

        <p>" By the way, there is no such thing as "misinformation". "  This sentence is misinformation.  Absolutely it matters that awful subreddits like this exist, because people not taking the vaccine literally kills people, when any rational view of the vaccine should be it is far safer to take the vaccine, along with its relatively minor side vaccines, instead of risking covid, and its side effects, which include everything up to mass death.   Its looking like the vaccination rate will probably be around 70%, which means we probably won't achieve herd immunity and thousands, if not more, will probably die.  Awful places like this subreddit which spread misinformation, causing people not to take the vaccine have blood on their hands.  Yes I am scared places like this are spreading.  Not because I fear the "truth getting out."  Because I fear lies and misinformation getting out that will very literally get people killed.  I believe in the first amendment, but the first amendment doesn't protect lies that lead to death. I absolutely hope reddit bans this place.  Vaccines are the reason we don't have many mass illnesses today, and they could be the reason we don't have covid, if people didn't fall for this nonsense.</p>

        <p>" How did we ever survive covid before the vaccine was released???!!  "  Some people didn't survive.   Nobody claimed Covid had a 100% death.  Not even the black plague had a 100% death rate rate.  But with Covid, your odds of survival, or your odds of not passing on the virus to other people are higher with the vaccine, so its illogical not to take it if you can. Its looking like we probably need about 80-90% to get vaccinated for herd immunity.  No, we don't need 100%, which is impossible, because some people have legitimate medical conditions preventing.  I mean legitimate medical conditions, not nonsense they read online, but this is an extremely small percentage of the population.  But everyone else getting vaccinating would protect them.  But a sizable percentage of the population not getting vaccinated because of a lies and nonsense they read in places like that is hurting that goal.</p>

        <p>a one percent death rate still means tens of millions would die if everyone got the virus worldwide.  That's otherwise known as mass death on the levels of most of the worst genocides in history.  We should prevent that if possible.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs not a one percent death rate for most people, which is why you protect the vulnerable while letting everyone else get it and get over it. We‚Äôd be at herd immunity now had that been the approach. </p>

        <p>Everyone exists in society, and more vulnerable people will be in contact with less vulnerable people. For example, even nursing homes, vulnerable people will be in contact with nursing workers, who will live mostly in the outside society and be in contact with many other people. Therefore less vulnerable people need to take the vaccine as well to protect more vulnerable people.  You simply can't wall of 90 year olds from the rest of society.  It isn't possible, and this requires all of us.</p>

<p>No, it doesn‚Äôt require <strong>all</strong> of us. It requires the people who are in contact with 90 year-olds.</p>

        <p>Caregivers go out and public and can get the virus from there.  Yes it requires all of us.  All of us are in connection.   The Kevin Bacon 6 degrees game is very real.  The vaccines aren't 100% effective.  They are 90-95 effective.  Everyone who gets the vaccine helps reduce the odds of tranmission at every step of the process.  Old people can't simply just be locked in a broom closet somewhere.  Everyone taking the vaccine can help prevent that.</p>

        <p>&rt;people not taking the vaccine literally kills people</p>
<p>Is this a fair causal link to create a blanket statement out of? You ignore all the variables that surround a person's age, health, behavior, location, living arrangement, attitude, profession, etc. and instead rely on mediated sources accessed through a screen to form a predetermined conclusion. The entire notion requires a certain trust in the chain of information- and governments, corporations, and media don't have the cleanest record.</p>
<p>I'd be careful assuming that something you don't agree with is simply a "lie." There are certain elements of the world that can't be controlled- that is nature. I can see exactly how you are scared from your position- however, you won't convince or calm this crowd through inferring them to be awful and implying they have blood on their hands.</p>

        <p>Serious question to you. I have had COVID, a nasty case because I had just gotten over the flu the month before.  They are saying that people who had covid will probably have a worse response to the vaccine, and frankly, I don‚Äôt have the funds to afford to get that sick again. Am I exempt from your judgement?</p>
