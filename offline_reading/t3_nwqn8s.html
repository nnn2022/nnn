    <strong>Do y'all remember those 'these are fake news sites and these are not fake news sites' infographs and trees of descending 'fakery' that arbitrarily placed different mainstream media news sites on different levels...</strong>
    <p><p>To me that's one easily visible form of the ongoing psyop in the states that has allowed this past year and a half of madness to take place. I remember so many of my friends reposting those on social media and thinking to myself, 'are you kidding me? You don't realize all mainstream media is Propaganda for our government/the elite class's interests (one in the same)? What have you been yelling about all this time?' it was a moment of awakening for me that all these people who I thought were on the same page as me (maybe not agreeing about everything on the page, but at least on the page together) were actually not. I know those memes were picture form of what every news station was saying at the time as well. I think if I call my friends attention to this it would be hard for them to deny because it was quite a big thing at the time.</p>
<p>These friends of mine still haven't woken up. I'm currently writing a document to hopefully reach some of them. A section of it I am using to show them the behavioral psychology/psychological warfare that has been at play their entire lives to brainwash them/ The People at large into their current state of cognitive dissonance and complicity. I started this post off with an example to ask for y'all to share any that you can remember from before covid-19 times like the title example, or that are currently happening right now. For instance one I've seen in the past couple months are memes about how small business owners are 'bosses' and thus are not a part of 'the people' of whom are their employees. God, my friends who I remember consistently posting about the necessity of building up the community through supporting small businesses, did a 180 the second their social media page got flooded with a meme that said otherwise. They don't realize that often what's trending on social media (namely Facebook and Instagram) is more propaganda by/for the elite class's interests.</p>
<p>Please share your examples here, I'll be really thankful. I still have hope that I can reach some of my loved ones with this document.</p></p>
