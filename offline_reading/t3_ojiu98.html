    <strong>What are they gonna do when there is a REAL virus?</strong>
    <p><p>Think a virus like the black plague or whatever. Where people are <em>literally</em> dropping dead in the streets. A virus with maybe a 50% survival chance instead of 99%. What are they gonna do then? Especially the public, looking at how they're pissing themselves right now when they see me in a store without mask. </p>

        <p>Seeing how very few panicked with the ebola thing a few years back, the media might just ignore it intentionally. That is, of course, they are affected by it as well.</p>

        <p>Was that outbreak even real? Or practice for the current one?</p>
<p>This was an outbreak of the deadliest known virus to man that had people infected in Monrovia - a highly populated city with slum environment and no healthcare. How is anyone there still alive?</p>
<p>Maybe those "crazy" people that were breaking into the hospitals set up by the UN/WHO were actually right to break their people out and claim the whole thing was made up.</p>
<p>I have always had little trust in the government and the media but what little trust I still had is gone now.</p>

        <p>if such a scenario played out, you would have a breakdown of govt because you would actually have politicians and bureaucrats no longer showing to work. most western democracies would fail because houses of parliament would no longer function due to the lack of representatives. if parliamentary leaders survived they would probably issue a state of emergency and the military would be deployed (provided they were able to contain the illness within); i.e. martial law. If not, most organized bureaucratic institutions would completely fail and you would pretty much be on your own. there would probably not be much of a response either because any research institutions; hospitals, universities, defence departments would either be overloaded or would completely shut down. private organizations would also no longer operate so the response would either be drawn out or there would be no solution at all.</p>
<p>Any sea-locked countries would completely lock down, and, if their institutions survived, would guard their borders without mercy against any external threats. ppl would probably try to flee their own countries, most probably by boat because all commercial flights would be grounded, and, if they made it past the navy, would try and get to these isolated "safe havens".</p>
<p>Supply chains would pretty quickly collapse an the economy would grind to a halt. Paper money would be become worthless and bartering for food would become the norm. Also, growing one's own food would become a priority as well as defending one's land against marauders.</p>
<p>Small, isolated communities would probably evolve where the virus has not had as much of an effect, mainly out in rural areas. These small communities would be hierarchical in nature and probably militant.</p>
<p>The virus would probably lose its severity fairly quickly as it mutated and would eventually result in mild symptoms. The dead, if not dealt with quickly, would create a secondary pandemic as the corpses would create a new set of major health problems. Animal plagues would be one such issue.  </p>
<p>As the virus fizzles out, small communities would begin to connect together again and society would probably rebuild over the next couple of decades. It would have to be a pretty deadly virus that would wipe out everyone and viruses tend to mutate into more harmless strains to avoid going extinct themselves.</p>

        <p>They are going to inject whatever they can in their muscles.</p>
<p>I believe that the main thing people seem to forget is the likelihood of a serve pandemic happening are extremely slim due to the fact that people are generally more hygienic.</p>
<p>I remember reading a study on the black plague, and the author said the main issue was that during that time people didn't shower and wash their hands.</p>

        <p>You would see similar things to what is happening in South Africa at the moment, panic, chaos, violence, and lots of death.</p>
<p>Supply chains would break, we would lose the ability to buy basic goods and basic utilities. </p>
<p>It would be pure chaos. At this point people would isolate without having to wait for the government to tell them to lockdown. You would probably even see the government do the opposite and force people to work just to maintain society.
Instead of spreading fear, they would try to downplay everything because society would collapse overnight.</p>
<p>That’s a true pandemic. Not this bullshit.</p>

        <p>the media would downplay it really hard. You wont believe its a super deadly virus till its in your city. The military would go into full control and real quaratane - they will shot you if you try to leave the quaratene. At that point media cant downplay it anymore, so they will need someone to blame. A mad scientist, or a accident because of bad management in a enemy nation. Russia, china? A nation that us not under western control.</p>
<p>At some point you cant tell if the virus or the chaos and riots are the worst part. No more food in the stores. Government breaks apart. Local "security"/war lords will rise.</p>

        <p>Hey buddy, why don't you transport yourself to impoverished dark-age england with no showers or sinks to wash yourself in, and no real way to screen people for the virus. Come back and tell me how it goes, I'd be interested to know how you handle a virus in a time without scientific advancement as we have it today, and how you think it would spread through all of europe with the internet and so much information and forewarning. It's people like you who would die first, when will you realize that this pandemic is a "real" pandemic? Damn goofball.</p>
