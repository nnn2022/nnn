        <p>My friends brother is also an MD who works with an at risk population and while he’s had a FEW covid patients, he can attest to what this md is saying!!! And he works in a major metro city on the east coast in a very locked down area.  He was saying in March this will only be a danger for the usual populations flu is dangerous for and is appalled at the overreacting.  He doesn’t speak up because he obviously needs his job.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder how many medical doctors, nurses, microbiologists and others who actually have expertise dealing with viruses professionally actually agree with the Covid-19 hysteria and all the measures imposed because of it.</p>
<p>Are those with a dissident view the silent minority... or are they the silent majority?</p>

        <p>I have had a few family members get it. Their doctor tells them not to worry just stay home a couple weeks. Their "special doctor" that they get referred to enlightens them by telling them to basically get fitted for a coffin and wear a mask. Also straight up telling them they will get it again. So if you can catch it again this renders a vaccine useless right?</p>

<p>Covid-19 appears to be nothing but a superflu, by which I mean that symptoms &amp; seasonality both seem similar to that of the common flu, but Covid-19 symptoms are more extreme and more lethal for a specific segment of the population (especially people about 65).</p>
<p>Effectiveness for flu vaccines is limited because influenza mutates fairly rapidly, which means that a vaccine based on strains from one year isn't guaranteed to be effective against strains from the next year.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with mutation rates of Covid-19, but it would be hardly farfetched for Covid-19 to be have similar to the flu here as well...</p>

<p>It's not guaranteed to be useless... but it's not guaranteerd to be useful either. And, without extensive testing, chances are that the vaccine will actually cause more harm than it prevents.</p>

<p>It's hard to tell. </p>
<p>Most people who disagree with the mainstream narrative have gotten used to attempts to silence them by both peers and establishment goons. So it's hard to get an idea of how many people actually are drinking the Kool-Aid when most of the rest of the public have learnt to keep their mouths shut...</p>

        <p>Except no, it is not 'just dangerous for the usual populations flu is dangerous for'.</p>
<p>My mother while being 69 years old was HEALTHIER than I was and had the flu last year. It did not kill her. In fact she wouldn't even have noticed she had it except for the diarrhea.</p>
<p>This year? CoVid-19 killed her and no, she did not 'suddenly become infirm'.</p>
<p>It is time to admit it: CoVid-19 is not just troublesome 'for the usual population', it is troublesome for certain people out of all age groups and some of them do not have 'the usual pre-ex's' like being overweight.</p>
<p>Example: The bodybuilder whose case was publicized in March who had CoVid-19 and it literally ate all of his muscle away to nothing.</p>
<p>Now I know you are going to say "He is the exception to the rule!" but from my research? No, he isn't. From my own experience having CoVid-19 melt 25 pounds in 4 days off my butt he is not.</p>

        <p>Calm down there fella!  Mom could also have gotten a case of MRSA or been wrongly medicated and passed on.  Heck, her 2020 flu could have attacked her like a flu that almost took me out at age 35! Many many things kill our family and friends: accidents, illness, medical mistakes, violent crime.  But taking away basic freedoms and rights from everyone to prevent EVEN ONE MORE DEATH is fucking ridiculous.</p>

        <p>so you're using another exception to the rule (the losing 25 lbs in 4 days, which is a lie anyway, like literally goes against the laws of physics) to show that the first exception was not an exception? the fact is that more than 99.9% of people under 50 survive this virus. that is the actual rule.</p>

        <p>I don't think it is too bad, they have their reasons and are fairly clear in their rules.   My main problem with it is that they do not approve enough content and often approve things long after the original article/content was published so the first page can seem a bit stale and out of date</p>

        <p>They rules are absolutely no consistent, not to mention that moderators multiple times approve their own posts without even checking if they are breaking the rules.
They don't allow things related to masks, but they allow discussions about any other restriction.
Opinion posts are usually rejected, unless the moderators like the post.
They suck horribly.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, people in another sub that I post to were freaking out about ICUs being full in Texas. People claiming to be or know nurses were talking about how hospitals are so full that patients are being airlifted to hospitals all over the state and freezer trucks were storing dead bodies in the parking lot. Then you had that "nurse" from South Dakota claiming that dying patients were gasping for air while saying "this can't be real". Yet somehow people would rather believe those stories than what this doctor is saying. So sick of the misinformation being spread and upvoted.</p>

        <p>That thread is a gold mine and gives me hope. I have noticed that the people I see objectively opposing the pandemic narrative are usually doctors or people who work in that field. Unfortunately they planted the anti-5g movement to completely take away credibility from anyone who denied the narrative. I see a lot of poorly educated people, government puppets, WHO puppets and irrelevant celebrities supporting the pandemic narrative. While the actual doctors seem to be entirely against it. What's troubling is that more and more the propaganda is not only about the seriousness of the pandemic but against those who oppose the official narrative.</p>
<p>It's amazing how people get their two minutes of hate through this, getting to blame someone for all the cases or deaths. I had never seen it that way, but it's amazing how true it is.<br>
Let's say a close family member of yours died with covid and you think the virus killed him. Anyone who opposes the narrative and doesn't wear a mask or follow regulations despite having ZERO symptoms is now prime suspect number one, because "HE'S SPREADING IT!" (despite the fact that he very likely does not have it, otherwise he would be sick)</p>
<p>Or let's say that your business closed down because of restrictions. Whose fault is it? "It's not the governments fault, it's those covid deniers' fault for not following all restrictions and causing more infections! Of course the state had to lock down harder! We need to stop the deniers!"</p>
<p>Or let's say your sister couldn't get medical care and passed away because the hospital couldn't accept "non-serious patients" due to covid. Guess where all your hate gets channeled to?  Ignore the fact that ICUs have been a mess for decades and even flu outbreaks in past years cause chaos in the ICU! "It must be the anti-maskers! They don't wear masks and spread the virus! If they didn't spread it then the hospital would be able to work properly and my sister wouldn't have died!"</p>
<p>I have been seeing an increase in people's hate against anyone with the contradicting narrative, and it's very very worrying. Look at social media (or don't, really) People are practically asking for a public lynching for those who don't follow rules.</p>
