    <strong>Adolf Whitmer Speaks: "Those Evil Kidnappers Were Egged On By Trump!!!</strong>
    <p><p>Michigan governor invokes the go-to excuse of "blame the Orange Man!" No one would wish her harm because she has literally turned into a tyrant, right?</p>
<p>This woman is batshit crazy. Is there no way to recall her for being "not of sound mind"?</p>

        <p>Those kidnappers are ghetto hipsters that want to grab and disembowel all elected officials. </p>
<p>I think they are equal opportunity kidnappers that just so happened to really dislike the pandemic rules Whitmer has in place. That's on her and no one else. Maybe she shouldn't have taken away peoples power boating rights or the neighbor visiting rights. Maybe she should've considered what might happen when you take away the peoples right to buy seeds at home depot. </p>
<p>I am not promoting violence or attempted governor kidnappings but, our elected officials need to realize that they can only push some of us so far. If the little tyrants keep up the shit, I'd be willing to bet harsh pushback, on mask nonsense and lockdowns and everything else, will become commonplace. </p>
<p>Some of us just want to be left alone, to enjoy what little time we have, with the ones we love. Nothing more. We don't ask for or need much. When the enjoyment gets disrupted and we are not being left alone, for no logical reason, especially with authoritarian behaviors, it can only be tolerated for so long. I don't think our elected officials think about things like this. They dont understand how many of us believe politicians are useless if they aren't going to do the only job they have to do, which is whatever the people need and want them to do on our behalf. They should remember that they used to be called public servants. Something tells me we would all be just fine without them, to be honest. We would probably thrive without politicians, left and right.</p>
<p>I don't think the extreme responses, to the new cold going around,  are going to end anytime soon. The extreme responses to our "leaders" extreme responses will likely increase because of this reality.</p>

<p>Exactly. Even for the powerful, when it comes to peoples' livelihoods and well-beings, FAAFO has always been probably the biggest factor.</p>
