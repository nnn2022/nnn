    <strong>Is the current Delta scare meant to promote any future "booster shots"?</strong>
    <p><p>I have a feeling the elites (TPTB) realized that without a proper scare tactic about reinstating mask mandates/other restrictions that more people won't be motivated to get on any possible vaccine booster shots when the flu season comes around and they inevitably rebrand it as the "delta plus variant" or whatever other variant they come up with by the winter.  If you notice, plenty of people on even the main coronavirus sub have said that "once i got the vaccine, its over, thats it." They most likely wouldn't get the booster shots unless they up the fear mongering.</p>
<p>If this happens, this is actually quite a genius move on their part since it'll make the public more motivated to get whatever is in those booster shots so that they would again place their hopes on that being the "way out".</p>
<p>If I'm being honest, I 100% saw this coming also when the MSM reported that Biden's 4th of July vaccine goal percentage wouldn't be met, so obviously they're going all out with the scare tactics as well in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>SIDE NOTE:</strong> In regards to the fear mongering, I wouldn't say the media is evil, since they're simply doing what makes the $$$$ and clicks. Business strategy. If it was good news that did that, then they'd report the current situation with an optimistic spin to it, but the bad news is what mostly generates interest, and money talks, so the mainstream media simply goes with the flow.</p></p>

        <p>I think that's what it is.  Of course since covid is so "deadly" (even though no one I know had it let alone died from it), so now there will have to be a booster for each variant: delta, epsilon, and so on.</p>

        <p>Big pharma is making bank off the vaccine. I wonâ€™t be surprised when they announce that we need to get the vaccine every 6 months for the rest of our lives.</p>

        <p>The boosters were always part of the plan. Why provide people long term protection over temporary relief. These companies want you sick and coming back, but most importantly they want your money. Year after year.</p>

        <p>They'll probably end up telling the vaxxed that they need boosters because the last vax makes them more susceptible to the latest variant at that time.</p>
