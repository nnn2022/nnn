    <strong>PSA about Covid Vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>There is ample information out there about the severe reactions from these vaccines. Blood clots, stroke, brain bleeds, memory problems, nerve pain, miscarriages, menstrual irregularities, migraines, brain fog, fatigue, convulsions, chest pain, heart attacks, pericarditis. </p>
<p>Understand that if you experience these issues, no one will be able to help you. Doctors don't know how to treat such severe issues as very low platelets coupled with blood clots. Know this now <strong>before</strong> you line up to get them. You will be on your own. Many people are suffering and the medical community offers little help. Heed this warning. Getting these injections so you can travel or go to a concert or even hold a job is not worth destroying your health. Health agencies and governments <strong>do not care about your health and well being.</strong> If they did, they'd be recommending Vitamin C and D and would never have suggested disgusting unsanitary masks and pushed experimental injections that showed animals did poorly. The government will not save you. The government will not protect you. If you suffer ill effects you will be shunned by the vaccine proponents and forced to lie on subreddits that you didn't get the vaccine but you are suffering vaccine related symptoms from "long Covid." It is obvious that is occurring.</p>
<p>ETA: If you should have a reaction, please go to the emergency room but know that support options are limited as doctors do not know what is happening.</p></p>

        <p>That's the truth. In addition to not knowing how to treat you, they will also claim your health problems are not related to the vaccine.</p>
