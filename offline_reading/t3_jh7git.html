    <strong>Why is this Subreddit called 'NoNewNormal' when it has emphatically happened before periodically throughout history, and life eventually returns back to normal?</strong>
    <p><p>Oh, by the way, a link from your Aunt's Facebook page that opens up complete waffle, isn't an argument. You literally cannot deny that this isn't 'new'.</p>
<p>The 1918 pandemic is almost identical, there was even an Anti-Mask league in San Francisco, Schools closed etc (To be fair, masks back then were terrible). 'Wear a mask to save a life!' was even a headline in the Chronicle. </p>
<p>Also Physicians in Venice during the black plague weren't allowed to leave the City, as they weren't able to socially distance from patients. </p>
<p>Enjoy your day, smile, and cheer up or you'll feel like a real clown when this is over.</p></p>

        <p>Difference between the 1918 flu and 2020 flu is the mortality rate of covid 19 which the CDC and WHO have stated is 0.1% </p>
<p>And life won't return back to normal cause things like cash, all the surveillance shit is not going away after covid </p>
<p>Leaders and powerful people like rockefellers, klaus schwab (founder of the WEF) and tedros, boris Johnson have all publicly said we will never go back to normal and we need to transform society </p>
<p>So no, the new normal is permanent sadly unless we resist against these scum bags</p>

        <p>I agree.</p>
<p>BJ has said the world won't be the same, and he will clearly use it as an excuse for austerity etc. I more just meant the actual mask wearing and restrictions etc, I really believe won't be in the west longer than two years at the very maximum.</p>
<p>But, you literally cannot know the fatality rate of a disease this early. It takes years of data to collect and look back on. I imagine if they really have said that it's an estimate. Hopefully it is that low, but you're not even considering the people that are dying months and months after having it and recovering from it.</p>

        <p>Idk man 
Their already saying even if we do get a vaccine life won't be back to normal, or removal of restrictions, and the fact no one including myself isn't gonna take the vaccine and surveys have showed most people Arnt gonna take the vaccine (justified) </p>
<p>So when will it end seems to have no end point, and with the terrible test kits which are useless they can make it last as long as they want</p>

        <p>It takes time to distribute a vaccine so obviously you can't instantly have everybody go back to normal.</p>
<p>Also, although so far it's effectiveness looks promising (particularly the Oxford one) because it's been fast tracked it might only be a 50 or 60% effective vaccine which would just calm things down for a bit while a  much better one is made.</p>

        <p>I keep seeing that figure, it doesn't make sense to me because you can't know a fatality rate this early on. We even have people dying months after recovering from it, so I find it odd that the WHO would state that.</p>

        <p>Ofc not fuck the who, but 0.1% makes sense as they stated that 750million have been infected worldwide wide </p>
<p>And where's the proof of people dying from it months later??? And the death rate isn't accurate as their counting anyone who dies WITH the virus </p>
<p>That includes homocides, alcohol poisoning, car crash, motor cycle crash, Parkinson's, drug overdose, hip injury and what not</p>

        <p>I mean, you'd have to get in touch with the families of the people who have died months later - that's if the news showing you a picture of a the now dead person isn't enough for you.</p>
<p>I'm not saying they definitely don't count it when they shouldn't, and I don't think they should, the post isn't about calling out the mistakes of the ONS.</p>
<p>However long covid is a genuine thing that can kill after recovery, and I personally know somebody who is still massively struggling months later.</p>

<p>Every time we have had epidemics, people estimate a really high death rate at the beginning .. and then it doesnt turn out to be as bad as predicted.  &rt;EVERY&lt; time.  HIV/AIDS, SARS, MERS, etc etc etc. At the end it is a fraction of what was predicted at the beginning.</p>

        <p>I mean, it'd kinda be better if it had a high death rate.</p>
<p>People that are dead can't pass on an illness, as I think the case was with SARS. 2000 dead or something and then boom finished.</p>
<p>1% death rate sounds great but not when every fucker has it. It's pretty simple maths.</p>

<p>&rt;Now turned up, the machinery was set into motion. Researchers got to work examining the molecular structure of the virus. The pharmaceutical industry started to develop vaccines. Government agencies laid out disaster plans. There was only one thing that everyone was ignoring: <em>The new pathogen was, in fact, relatively harmless.</em>

        <p>If you can't breath with a mask on for 30 seconds when you walk into a pub, you're clearly vulnerable and should probably be at home for your safety.

        <p>Masks were mandatory in many places during 1918, 80% of people wore them.</p>
<p>If it feels like the 'brainwashing' is more pervasive today, then that's probably because we have the internet now.</p>

        <p>You are talking about maybe 3-4 months. Because as of October/November the Flu was just starting to hit the US, and by Springtime everything is back to normal.  80% of the people wore them <em>in cities where there was a mask mandate</em>. But in most cities there was no mandate.</p>

        <p>I'm wasting my breath, but what the hell...</p>
<p>The NWO takes one little step at a time. They are extremely patient and they have been at it for hundreds if not thousands of years, through generations and bloodlines. They are always proverbially boiling the frog very gently so that the frog doesn't jump out of the pot.</p>
<p>Due to unforeseen circumstances outside of their control they have been forced to rush things this time, which is most uncharacteristic of them. As a result, they have risked waking millions of people up ahead of time - which is exactly what is happening now. Not you - you're safe. Nobody can wake you up.</p>
<p>I could go into more detail of what has changed, but there is no point, because that's really advanced stuff. You're already struggling with the basics I've said so far, so there is no point even bringing that up.</p>

        <p>Isn't that timeframe a bit long for the goal to be a communist society? The Communist Manifesto isn't till 1848. Wouldn't it make more sense to make gradual steps towards communism? Instead, here in the UK, we have a Conservative government that just banned even teaching using resources from organisations that are anti-capitalist - doing so wouldn't mean trying to make students agree with them, it's usual to use lots of different resources, and it would include a lot of significant historical texts. And lockdowns are currently taking from the working class and giving to massive corporations. If you're in the US, then communism, and even European democratic socialism, is presented in propaganda as the terrifying bogeyman: isn't it a bit convenient for that mainstream narrative if a conspiracy theory agrees with it? Which narrative do you really get, the far left -and I don't mean Liberalism-, or the rampant NeoCon capitalist? Are worker's co-operatives being promoted during this -I got some food from one when I was in quarantine-, or Amazon, a huge corporation that's notorious for just how exploitative of workers it is?</p>

        <p>The technology wasn't there for the masks to be as effective, and they didn't know how to use them properly.</p>
<p>The virus was worse for young healthy people who were out more, and it may have been more deadly.</p>
<p>Thanks for your measured and totally non aggressive input.</p>
<p>Edit - by the way there are quite a few examples of people who have been positive for Covid without knowing, wore a mask and didn't infect anybody.</p>
<p>One example is a hairdresser who wore a mask while servicing 139 customers. 0 of them tested positive afterwards.</p>

<p>You will find this is the <em>only</em> example for this. Which is why it is always used as "the proof example".</p>
<p>But .. we all know we like to see peer-reviewed tests and "gold-standard randomized testing", but somehow there is none of <em>that</em> showing the effectiveness of masks. Funny, hey? You would think there would have been enough time by now to come up with a good proof that masks work so that people wouldn't have to rely on a single anecdotal story about 2 hairdressers.</p>

<p>A masked guy who is positive on a plane where nobody else gets infected does not at all prove the mask was responsible.</p>
<p>Think about it .. Covid has a reproduction rate of 2.5 normally.  That means that under normal situations someone who is positive will give the virus to &rt;&rt;2.5 people&lt;&lt; as they go through their life of socializing, working, relaxing, and partying.  It's not like they are infecting everybody around them.  So it is not strange that an infected person could ride a bus, or a plane, or see a theatre show and <em>nobody else would get infected</em>.  Because over his 5 or so days of infectiousness he is only going to infect a total of 2.5 people on average.</p>
<p>Any actual randomized, peer-reviewed tests like what we normally like to see before we accept something as "science"?  Or have people just not had the time to do anything like that since all this started?</p>

        <p>I didn't say it was definitely the reason but out of 139 people, it's a pretty strange coincidence.</p>
<p>I think people on this sub confuse two things </p>
<p>1: Do masks work
2: Will wearing masks help stop the spread of the virus</p>
<p>They're not the same thing. </p>
<p>It's widely accepted that they do work, with cloth masks perhaps only catching large droplets, but still, it's better than nothing. It will take time before a full comprehensive study is released, but until then it makes logical sense to me just wear it, because even if we don't know for certain, it could be helping.</p>
<p>But then you will have some scientists who would say they're not effective, not because they don't work, but because you have to rely on people to have clean hands putting them on and taking them off, and  washing them after use. They're probably also worried that the main people who need them, clinicians, will find themselves with a shortage.</p>
<p>You also then have the problem of people touching their face more, and feeling safer and so not distancing or being as hygienic. You also have eye transmission as well, but epidemiologists would and have said that they don't think this form of transmission is as likely, and besides masks are primarily to protect others, and secondly for some form of self protection.</p>
<p>You'd be hard pressed to find a credible scientist who would just outright say 'Masks do not work'. But then again, some scientists think the world was made in six days, so I'm sure there are some.</p>

        <p>I agree with you actually.  Masks work .. "kind of".</p>
<p>As far as what I have read .. n95 masks offer protection, and cloth masks probably dont offer much.</p>
<p>But, like you said, that depends &rt;entirely&lt; on proper usage. And that means single use, proper fitting, and no touching.</p>
<p>And if you are using the mask incorrectly, like you say, you may even make yourself <em>more</em> dangerous because of issues with touching, and because you might ignore other considerations.</p>
<p>So .. for all intents and purposes .. masks are useless. The vast majority of people in masks out there are not wearing n95 masks, and are not wearing their masks correctly.</p>
<p>There are people who are wishing death on the anti-maskers, meanwhile they are <em>just</em> as "dangerous". Perhaps even more so, because they <em>think</em> they are being safe.</p>
<p>So with all of that going on, it just seems like big theatre to me.</p>

        <p>Sort of like security theatre you mean, but then again why bother locking down if you just want people to feel safe to go out when they actually aren't.</p>
<p>And yeah, both sides though anti maskers and people that wear them, I honestly never saw any of it being politicised but oh well, humanity finds a way.</p>

        <p>Oh, so now you are saying things did change permanently, your OP says it didn't? Make up your mind.  Those changes were the result of decisions made by governments and people DID protest, see: communism vs capitalism in the post-WW2 era.  America even fought a couple of bitter and bloody wars over it, Korea and Vietnam. That struggle went on for about 40 years after WW2 ended, until the fall of the Berlin wall.</p>

        <p>Yes, exactly, you agree with us. Changes are happening right now and we do not agree with those changes, we have every right to raise our voices against them, the same as capitalists protested against rising communism in our Western countries in the post WW2 era. If they hadn't, maybe communism would of won? Who knows. We aren't the ones saying no changes are happening, you are! We are about resisting and highlighting those changes, especially ones that we see as negative. Perhaps you agree with the changes, that's your right, but that isn't what you are saying in your OP, you are saying no changes are happening. Your logic is very confused.</p>

        <p>You're being disingenuous, this isn't about worrying about the economy, it's reductionist dog whistling about hoaxes, government control and fake news. If you really only cared about what might change from this, then for the time being you'd follow the guidance to get out of the situation quicker.</p>
<p>How do you even know that there won't be positive changes? You're just instantly going for the negative.</p>
<p>Economic reform for the better, a better understanding of how to deal with any future pandemics, highlighting of inequality in society, the list goes on. You're only interested in fear mongering people into open revolt rather than just giving them Occom's razor, and trying to come out of it stronger.</p>

        <p>No it isn't, that's how you have decided to interpret it. What you have now changed your stance to is 'Changes are happening and I agree with them', that is completely different from what your OP says. If you want, setup a new sub called YesNewNormal and you can go and discuss the 'positives', as you, subjectively, see them, in that sub. I do not see living in a highly surveilled, ultra authoritarian 'new normal' that values collective over individual rights and the removal of bodily autonomy as a good thing. You do, and that's your opinion, fine, no problems, but that isn't the stance this sub takes. This sub is for people who do not want these new changes.</p>
<p>As an aside, I think you are being hopelessly naive if you think the corporate elites who have engineered the current economic system to their own benefit will design and implement one that gives away everything they have worked so hard to secure for themselves.</p>

        <p>Good for your uncle. I work in catastrophe analysis which has included pandemic modelling, but mainly focused on hurricanes and earthquakes, for a multinational reinsurer.  I have worked in an advisory role for the UK government in the past as a representative from the reinsurance industry. </p>
<p>I'm hardly saying everyone that works for any of these organisations is evil, tbh I don't think any of them are 'evil', they just want to preserve the status quo. It is very naive of you to believe that the people who currently benefit from the system, people like Klaus Schwab, would voluntarily 'improve' the system, of course they will say they will 'improve' it, they are hardly going to say 'we want to make sure we keep getting richer and you all stay poor' are they.  They just use fuzzy terms like, for instance, 'stakeholder capitalism', and tell us that it is good for everyone.  I know you can't be bothered to read or use your own brain, but if you really think about it, I'm sure you can name a few times we have been told something was 'good for us' by our politicians, when the opposite was true. If not, you are clearly just happy inside your little bubble and I don't even know why you are here if you have no interest in informing yourself.</p>

        <p>Ah yes, wealth equals evil. We've really come full circle now.</p>
<p>I don't even see how any of this has to do with being angry about the pandemic anymore, you're intelligent enough to know 'they' would just use something else if they wanted to.</p>

        <p>Never said that, you keep putting words in my mouth. I would be considered wealthy by most, I don't need to work if I don't want to, in addition to my day job I own a bar / brewery (which sadly might go out of business due to covid restrictions). </p>
<p>I believe amassing insane levels of wealth and power far beyond what would be a proportional reward for success is wrong and allows those individuals to have a massively disproportionate affect on what we all think and how we all live.  I think changes ARE needed. I do not believe the changes being suggested, using this 'pandemic' as cover, by the very people who benefit, are anything but a smokescreen for further wealth inequality and control over the general population than they already have. They will never relinquish the huge amounts of wealth and power they have amassed willingly, so I instantly distrust change which is being cheerlead by those same people, masquerading as 'improvements' in our daily lives.</p>

        <p>Never let a crisis go to waste, I get it. I'm worried too.</p>
<p>Thing is if I put it to Occam's razor I have:</p>
<p>A) Powerful people are concerned about a virus that is damaging the economy and institutions they've built up over years, and want to find a solution to solve the problem, so that said institutions don't crumble and fall down, effectively destroying their power.</p>
<p>B) Powerful people aren't happy with the power they have and they want more of it. They love the pandemic and are going to use it to create inequality, death and unhappiness. They will able to do this easily and bypass all financial and corporate legislation, and in fact convince 8 billion people that it's actually going to benefit them.</p>
<p>It's funny actually, because if the second is true, you guys are the ones following it. </p>
<p>Is it not all of the right wing media that is anti mask anti vax and/or says it's a complete hoax? Rupert Murdoch must be loving that you think you're anti establishment by letting this thing spread easily.</p>

        <p>The problem with A is that the virus has made them all richer.  Small businesses (like mine) have been annihilated by the measures, but massive multinational corporations, supermarkets, etc. have all benefitted.  The top 100 billionaires are all richer now than they were in March.  So the idea that they are not benefitting from this is kinda wrong - it's a massive wealth transfer from small businesses to global corporations who already had a monopoly anyway.  The rules are setup in such a way that a chain pub, like Wetherspoons, or a chain restaurant like McDonald's, can continue to function while smaller businesses struggle to comply with the rules and turn a profit.  One of the many goals and hidden agendas behind 'the great reset' is to continue to put all the profits in the hands of the huge multinationals whilst making it almost impossible for small business to function.  From a huge initial drop in the stock market back in March, the indexes are back near all time highs, driven by huge tech companies who have benefitted from this.  If you want, look up 'K' shaped recovery, as that is what we are looking at.</p>
<p>https://www.investopedia.com/k-shaped-recovery-5080086#:~:text=What%20Is%20a%20K%2DShaped,industries%2C%20or%20groups%20of%20people.</p>
<p>Yes, it is mainly the far right who are saying it's a complete hoax, but there are loads of us who consider ourselves, or used to consider ourselves, somewhat left wing - I voted Labour in December in the UK, and on the right as well, who think the virus is real, but the threat has been hugely blown out of proportion and of course the evidence for that is everywhere.  I assume you think we are following B because what we are advocating is 'lengthening the pandemic' in your view, but that couldn't be further from the truth.  Sweden is the obvious example, whereby they did not enact a lockdown, they do not mandate masks, and they have now returned almost completely to normal, even lifting restrictions on elderly populations recently.  All lockdowns do is lengthen the pandemic, they do not reduce deaths, they do not solve anything - if you are from the UK, you will remember we were told '2 weeks to flatten the curve' - well, there was never any sign of a crisis in hospitals, that '2 weeks' turned into 6 months during which most hospitals sat near completely empty, and now we're starting to go through the same thing again, again based in no evidence of the first lockdown having any affect on mortality or rates of infection.  Our mortality rate is far worse than Swedens.  If you are interested in more of this, you should listen to episode 21 of the Escape from Lockdown podcast, an interview with Dr Mike Yearndon, who personally knows many of the members of SAGE, has published over 60 peer reviewed papers in biology / virology related fields and is an ex-CEO of a biotech firm.  There is also of course, the great barrington declaration, established by Sunetra Gupta, Jay Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorf, all top experts in their respective fields.</p>

<p>https://gbdeclaration.org/</p>
<p>The entire left / right thing is sold as a distraction from what really matters, and is really completely irrelevant.  There are a bunch of people in here who believe that when the US election is over, all the measures will be wound down because this thing is somehow about the election.  It isn't, it's happening globally.  You said earlier that Western governments have all reacted differently, I very much disagree with that, they have all followed virtually the same path, the only true exceptions to that are Sweden and Belarus.  Every other country enacted a lockdown that went on for months, of varying levels of harshness.  If you had told me back in January, that the people I would agree with most (on this single issue), would be the fringe right, Brexit voting arm of the Tory party, I'd have said no fucking way.  But I am open minded, I can look at the evidence, and I treat every argument the same, whoever is making it.  In this case, the left have gone completely mad, and have made me ashamed to even call myself left wing, so much so that I do not consider myself left anymore, neither do I consider myself right though, I am now in no-man's land, some kind of apolitical wanderer.  I do not, however, consider lockdown a purely left or right wing thing, you can find left wing governments pushing it as well as right wing ones, it isn't divided like that at all.</p>
<p>Sincerely, I hope that people like you are correct, that this is a coincidence, but I really don't think either Occam's or Hanlon's explains what is happening as you have to make too many assumptions regarding the shear level of incompetence and stupidity of our government and scientific community, at every single level, that I simply do not think can be true, knowing that some of them are very smart people.  Having worked with them, of course our government is incompetent - but I really don't think they are THIS incompetent.  If you were being very kind, you could possibly put it down to mass hysteria combined with political opportunism, which is still possible, but every day that passes, things keep rolling out exactly the way that people like me, from the start, have warned about.</p>

        <p>I imagine that wealth gain is mostly passive when you consider Healthcare companies, and then on top of that an increase in charitable donations during this time. I’m not 100% sure if this is the case in the UK, but in America Philanthropist billionaires essentially get a sort of tax break when they donate to charities, and then the average person has to pay the tax to make up for that, creating an even wider wealth gap. It’s a messed up system but as far as I’m aware that’s the way it is. </p>
<p>I’d say the same for this K recovery effect, it’s fucked, but again it seems mostly passive and expected, although to be frank I don’t really know enough about it.
And no I think it’s more likely to be A because it doesn’t have unnecessary assumptions or tinfoil hat moments, I thought it was you that subscribed to the B view. I do think lockdowns are important if you need the NHS to stay in control, and I don’t see a problem with just ‘delaying’ the inevitable if it buys some time for a vaccine. I presume you will neither have a vaccine nor think lockdowns do anything however. The tier system at the moment is likely to be the one that stays around. One thing we probably both agree on is that every time they’ve taken any of these measures it’s been complete waffle.</p>
<p>As for left/right wing I agree with you in premise that it isn’t political and it shouldn’t be, but unfortunately it’s been made to be and there’s no way around that. Labour would care less about paying furlough or giving people a universal basic income, whereas BJ has tried to do this balancing act of the economy and health and just ended up fumbling around like a clown (I’m not saying Labour would definitely have handled it better). Also it’s just the extremities in people’s behaviour, to me a chap walking down the street on his own with a mask on looks equally as bonkers as somebody who refuses to wear one, I hate this pick a side bullshit. We really are a nation of children.</p>
<p>So adre we talking about actual number of fatalities or fatality rates with Sweden? ‘Cause last I heard their rate was actually higher than England’s relatively, and even if it is lower they do have the benefit of being a vastly less dense country than the UK, same for New Zealand who also seem to be fine now but then again they also have an actually competent government.</p>
<p>Were you working for the government when it was this current set of pond life though? When I look at Matt Hancock’s face Hanlon’s version is the first thing I think of. </p>
<p>That being said it’s not just the governments fault though, we’ve got specialists being paid thousands a day that then lose a ton of test data because they’re still using an ancient version of Microsoft excel, it really is quite staggering some of the fuck ups Public Health England etc have managed to pull off.</p>
<p>My Dad always just says that ‘Boris is just doing the best he can, I’d like to see how his critics would handle it.’ And while I don’t really agree with him, he kind of has a point, we haven’t needed to handle anything like this in over 100 years, and the UK is an absolute petri dish of overpopulated and often impoverished places. Couple that with still learning something new about this virus every day, I imagine they’re trying to be cautious. It’d be a real shitter if it turns out long covid is actually quite common for example.</p>
<p>I’ve bookmarked your links to the podcast and the other one, I think I just need to wind down for the evening now though. Sorry for how scattered this all was but I tried to respond to everything, and I’ve also had a few glasses of wine.</p>
<p>Best of luck with the brewery, just remember that a lot of people here are full blown New World Order, lizard people enthusiasts, so fact check everything, and I’ll do the same with the doomers and lefties.</p>
<p>edited to put the text in sections because I had a migraine after looking at it for 2 seconds</p>

        <p>Personally, I think the NWO lizard people guys have more of a grasp on reality these days than your average mask wearing sheep on the Tube has, but there ya go.  One more link for you, on that subject, from Oxford university:</p>
<p>https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/</p>
<p>&rt;Only one randomised trial (n=569) included cloth masks. This trial  found ILI rates were 13 times higher in Vietnamese hospital workers allocated to cloth masks compared to medical/surgical masks, RR 13.25, (95%CI 1.74 to 100.97) and over three times higher when compared to no masks, RR 3.49 (95%CI 1.00 to 12.17). 4</p>
<p>Just another example of things being mandated based in no evidence.  No problem with advising them, massive problem with mandating them.  On vaccine, I won't take a rushed vaccine that has every probability of not having gone through safety checks properly for a virus which is of no risk at all to me, no.  I have had the MMR and BCG (Tuberculosis) vaccines, I am by no means anti-vaxx, but I have a massive problem with mandatory vaccines and rushed, possibly unsafe vaccines (see India, where hundreds of thousands of children were paralysed by a trial polio vaccine, or indeed the 1970s swine flu vaccine that ended with pharmaceutical companies getting sued for damages caused by it).  Of course, this time around, the vaccine manufacturers have been indemnified so even if they do fuck it up and it causes massive side effects in the population, there will be no legal recourse.  </p>
<p>Swine flu vaccine:
https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/long-shadow-1976-swine-flu-vaccine-fiasco-180961994/</p>
<p>India polio vaccine:

<p>Indemnification for vaccine manufacturers:
https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2020/09/22/583555.htm</p>
<p>I believe mandatory vaccines are coming, maybe not at first, but via coercion, probably via some kind of digital immunity system where you need to present evidence of vaccination to do normal things, beginning with flights then spreading to other places (so that they can continue to claim 'they aren't mandatory!'), it is unfortunate that being for bodily autonomy will be labelled as anti-vaxx.  As long as they are offered on a voluntary basis and people are given the full facts about side effects and efficacy, I have no problem with a covid vaccine being offered.  I am well aware I am in a vanishingly small minority in all of this and that for all intents and purposes, this argument is settled - I do not believe it can be stopped, so the best I can do is just be aware.  So let's hope you are right, and I am wrong.</p>

        <p>Perhaps they're tuned into the right frequency but it's one with a very crackly poor signal.</p>
<p>I'm confused, what you've just quoted me is just showing N95's are best, cloth masks second, and no mask the worst? It doesn't say ILI rates 'higher than it normally would be' which I think is what you've read it as.</p>
<p>I agree it's not a solid science, and somebody could just as easily find you an article with studies explaining why they're effective. There's too many variables.</p>
<p>I don't know how I'd feel about the digital vaccinated passport or whatever, it does stink of some kind of dystopian state but I don't see what benefit a government would have from it other than the populations health. They can quite easily track anyone with or without a 'I've been vaccinated card'.</p>
<p>I'm not sure of the specific swine flu case you're referring to but I'm pretty anybody could coincidentally develop an ailment after taking a vaccine and get a pretty penny out of it. It's happened already with a covid 19 trial, but he was the only one it's happened to and they discovered 0 correlation.</p>

        <p>I think you're misreading it, it says cloth mask ILI rates were 3 times higher than in no mask at all, and 13 times higher than in N95 masks.  Meaning cloth masks had a higher rate of infection than no mask - it is very possible therefore, that wearing a cloth mask could contribute to a higher rate of infection in the general population.  As the link says, this is the largest scale RCT we have on the efficacy of cloth masks, but again it is not general public, it is amongst health workers who are trained to use masks properly (ie. not screwing them up in your pocket, then taking it out and putting it back on again).  The general public can't even use them properly, so the chances they have any effect at all are virtually none.  Not enough for Sweden or Norway to recommend their use either.</p>
<p>There are zero RCTs (randomly controlled trials) showing any efficacy of cloth masks, only papers based on heuristics and models, which are barely worth the paper they are written on.  I added links to all my vaccine statements in my original comment.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah you're correct, getting to the evening and the first glass of wine has gone down the hatch.</p>
<p>That is interesting, but not enough for me to say masks don't work. It almost defies logic that somebody with clean hands puts on a mask and washes it etc, and is more likely to have influenza symptoms.</p>
<p>We don't have any information there about what they're doing in their spare time, which would be a big factor, but the differences are pretty apparent, even though it's a pretty small scale study. I would think maybe they were touching their face more but I find it hard to believe a clinician would be doing that while working with patients without cleaning their hands first. Proper head scratcher that one.</p>
<p>I find it interesting that there is even a difference between the two mask types though, even if it's an increase over no masks. If masks literally did nothing, then rates for the type of mask would be the same.</p>
<p>edit, have I read it correctly though that they let them wear masks or not as they normally would? i.e if you're wearing an n95 you'd be getting closer to patients more, cloth mask less so, and no mask probably not in much patient contact? If that's the case then I thought that'd be pretty obvious</p>

        <p>Both word wars were planned, organised, instigated and controlled by the NWO - yes.</p>
<p>All wars are.</p>
<p>As are all big changes in society, revolutions, economic crashes, big campaigns, etc.</p>
<p>Those things don't happen by accident. The vast majority of people can barely tie their shoelaces - let alone organising revolutions.</p>

        <p>"Why are people worried about climate change, when it has happened before in history and everything was fine?"</p>
<p>BTW - What do you think of the "virus pass" idea? Because that is part of the New Normal. You will have to be constantly tested to get your "green", and that will allow you to enter places and do things. That is how they will enforce compliance. That will be one new aspect of our future. And that has ramifications.</p>
<p>&rt;The 1918 pandemic is almost identical, there was even an Anti-Mask league in San Francisco, Schools closed etc (To be fair, masks back then were terrible). 'Wear a mask to save a life!' was even a headline in the Chronicle. </p>
<p>To be fair, the restrictions for the Spanish Flu were short-term, staggered, and localized. Mostly in big cities. </p>
<p>This is what things <a href="https://libcom.org/files/imagecache/article/images/history/WinnipegGeneralStrike.jpg">looked like by Spingtime 1919 Winipeg General Strike</a> .. or the <a href="https://www.pbase.com/johnglines/image/162031298">1919 Garbage Strike</a> .. <a href="https://i.redd.it/sgrjtd902pj21.jpg">waiting to go to theatre in March 1919</a> .. <a href="https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/jess-willard-and-jack-dempsey-in-the-ring-during-their-july-4th-1919-picture-id515213522?s=2048x2048">watching Dempsey fight in March 1919</a></p>
<p>All that is interesting right?  I mean, here those people are about 5 months past the Evil Spanish Flu of Death That Killed Gajillions Of People ... and <em>things are pretty much back to normal</em>, right?</p>
<p>They are having huge events, nobody is wearing masks, and everybody is crowded together.</p>
<p>So here is my question. Considering that the Spanish Flu was soooooo much worse than Covid, and as of those pictures there is no vaccine .. why aren't those people terrified of dying?</p>
