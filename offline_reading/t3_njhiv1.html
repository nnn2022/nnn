    <strong>The Hope Experiment</strong>
    <p><p>The “HOPE “ experiment.</p>
<p>During a brutal study at Harvard in the 1950s, Dr. Curt Richter placed rats in a pool of water to test how long they could tread water.
On average they'd give up and sink after 15 minutes.
But right before they gave up due to exhaustion, the researchers would pluck them out, dry them off, let them rest for a few minutes - and put them back in for a second round.
In this second try - how long do you think they lasted?
Remember - they had just swam until failure only a few short minutes ago...
How long do you think?
Another 15 minutes?
10 minutes?
5 minutes?
No!
60 hours!
That's not an error.
That's right! 60 hours of swimming.
The conclusion drawn was that since the rats BELIEVED that they would eventually be rescued, they could push their bodies way past what they previously thought impossible.
I will leave you with this thought:
If hope can cause exhausted rats to swim for that long, what could a belief in yourself and your abilities, do for you?
Remember what you’re capable of. 
Remember why you’re here. 
Just Keep swimming ....</p></p>

        <p>There has been a pretty big mass awakening (different to a mass awokening fyi) of varying degrees. The most extreme being the realization that the current government apparatus itself is the problem and not the people in charge.   </p>
<p>In my country voting is mandated. I got told all the time about those that fought and died for my right to vote. I retorted that they may regret their sacrifices if they saw the kinds of clowns we have to vote for. We never vote for the best person, we only ever vote for the least bad person. Rarely does any nation get a truly heroic and inspiring nominee. It is some twee banker or professional politician.  </p>
<p>The struggle I am seeing for those of us that have broken away from the collective is to re-group amongst ourselves. Everyone says "we must do something" equally waiting for someone ELSE to take the first step. We are a puff of steam rather than a dense ocean, in terms of collectivization and organization.   </p>
<p>My personal ideal would be to create an exploration party. Kinda like the settlers in the 19th century. Get a big group together. Walk out to the middle of nowhere, or into an old ghost town, and build a new society. In the Globalist strategy, it is harder to stay off the governments radar. But I do believe we need to start setting up sub-societies and safe communities and alliances.   </p>
<p>I worry it may be gulags for us or our children. It's weird to say that and not feel like I am being extreme but I can't help but anticipate it</p>

        <p>They did gulags before so why not now? This plandemic is bigger than WW1 &amp; 2 in that every nation in the world is now participating. Unlawful arrests and imprisonments were the norm back then, all over the world. We need to get together groups of sane people and build new societies like you say. And there's no reason to not start right away. Any group will do - it doesn't have to have hundreds of members to begin with. Later on when more people realize the shit we are in, more will join.</p>

        <p>I agree that it is bigger. The tinfoil sense I get is they have learned from the past mistakes of totalitarianism and they are cutting off escape routes for the next attempt - buying farmland, controlling trade and limiting industry, storing seeds in a vault deep in a snowy wasteland and giving us GMO seeds, reducing meat consumption, disarming populations etc etc etc etc etc. You get the gist. Can't flee if it's the whole planet. <br>
It may mean a portion breaks off and goes into the mountains reverting back to amish technology, but still better than a gulag.  </p>
<p>I hope our like-minded communities will strengthen in the coming years.</p>

        <p>My idea is trying to stay as far off the radar as possible, but at the same time trying to start a small community for support.  My close friends aren’t taking this seriously, most think Covid is over and we’re going back to the good old days.  I’ve talked to a few people on Reddit that have a similar mindset, but outside of this board, they are few and far between.</p>

        <p>Great analogy, thanks for posting.</p>
<p>What this study proved is exactly why the elites will lose. They have underestimated our human resilience badly and it will come back to bite them. They have no corresponding commitment to survival because they are pampered and cared for in ways none can imagine.</p>
<p>They don't understand that everyday we get thrown back in for Round 2. Most of our lives are absolutely about survival. They have no similar experiences to draw upon. They are devoid of real character and grit.</p>
<p>We will win because we are the rats!!</p>

        <p>I remember reading a story of these rescued bears from 15x15 ft cages where they grew up their entire lives. They were moved to an animal sanctuary with acres to roam about. The first week or two when they were let out they did not walk beyond the 15x15 ft area. They paced within it. Then one day one of them tested the boundary and ventured forward. The rest followed.</p>
<p>Just shows how if you are conditioned to limitations, you become afraid of freedom and need time to get used to it.</p>

        <p>This is exactly why restrictions keep getting loosened for a few weeks or even months at a time (especially during the summer) and then lockdowns return.</p>
<p>It gets people invested into believing if everyone just follows the rules and plays along they will get their life back. </p>
<p>It’s why people are gonna support vaccine passports in the fall when tons of people get sick (as they do anyways due to seasonal illness) and the new restrictions are blamed on the unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>Seems like they were no longer afraid, so they didn't expend all of their energy at once.</p>
<p>The thing that's happening now is, people are no longer afraid - they are getting together and actually talking about this experience, and I'm sure more and more are waking up to the reality of it. Without that fear, there is clarity.</p>

        <p>I foresee many people in the US moving to rural red states soon, Canadians too. The cult covidians can have their lockdowns and their overpopulated, hyper-surveiled, city centers. They’re vulnerable. Buy land, get off grid, supply your own resources. Teach and share.</p>

        <p>I agree, land prices have risen tremendously since the start of Covid so it makes it difficult to move away from city centers (I think this was intentional).  I was looking at properties in Florida, 10 acres of land outside of Tampa was selling for $50k in 2019, same property is being resold for 1.2 million.  This is happening everywhere in the US.</p>
