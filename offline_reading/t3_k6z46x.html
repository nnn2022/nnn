        <p>They sure haven’t, they killed my grandma who was just in the hospital for bowel blockage.</p>
<p>She was coughing so the doctor gave her a Covid test without our family knowing. She came back positive. That night she was coughing and wheezing the doctor claims and they put her on a ventilator. My mother got a call that morning she died. My family wasn’t even allowed to see her for proof no matter what we said. <br>
she was perfectly healthy besides the bowel problem and coughed due to allergies.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry your grandmother died but a bowel blockage is a very serious life-threatening event. Approaching 100% mortality if left untreated. </p>
<p>Also bowel obstruction causes vomiting which in elderly and debilitated people can lead to aspiration and subsequently pneumonia and death.</p>
<p>Also covid doesn’t typically cause wheezing so that points to something else going on besides covid (such as aspiration). You would need to do an autopsy to know for sure.</p>

        <p>Define “max pressure”?  ICU doctors have known for decades about the dangers of barotrauma, and use the least pressure possible to achieve the lowest possible volume for inspired breaths, and have done so for years.  I think you’re not as educated as you think you are.</p>

        <p>In February, in New York, the only information about CoVid19 we had (that we could trust) was from Italy.  It was bad there, and the worst part about Italy was how many nurses and doctors got it.  It wasn’t known how they got it, because nobody knew if it was or wasn’t aerosolized.  The best information available suggested it was, so every attempt was made to keep the patient from aerosolizing the virus on everyone in the vicinity.  So, when they went into respiratory distress, they were intubated, and intubated early, under controlled circumstances, before it became an emergency (it takes time to put on the appropriate PPE, and in February, it took additional time to <em>find</em> PPE, because it was in such short supply).  So, the appropriate treatment of Covid+ patients starting to show signs of hypoxemia was to intubate (in February).  We’ve learned a few things since then, such as how, with the appropriate PPE, high flow oxygen via nasal cannula (as high as 17 liters a minute) can forestall the need to intubate, and in a significant number of patients negate the need to intubate at all.  But, back in February, it was <em>against</em> best practice to use high flow oxygen, because the virus <em>does</em> get aerosolized all over the place, it just isn’t that dangerous as long as appropriate PPE is worn.  It didn’t matter <em>what their ventilator settings were</em>, what mattered was some patients got intubated, when they didn’t need to be.  Hind sight is always 20/20.  There was no malpractice, because malpractice is treating people in a way not medically acceptable.  What was done in February and March in New York was definitely medically acceptable.  In fact it was medically <em>necessary</em> given what little information was known.</p>

        <p>Interesting stuff, and kind of what I knew.</p>
<p>But ... without me being angry at the doctors involved, is it correct to call those "Covid deaths"?</p>
<p>If I have 10 "cootie" patients and I give them a treatment I believe will help them, but it kills them instead, should those be counted as "cootie deaths" at all?  </p>
<p>What if the Cooties was totally non-lethal, and if I had just left them alone they would have survived?  Should those still be counted as "cootie deaths" or did something else happen there?  If not malpractice, then what?  "An honest mistake"? Or just "on unfortunate turn of events"?</p>
<p>If that's what it was. Fine.</p>
<p>What isnt fine is then taking those deaths and representing them as if they were viral deaths in order to support lockdowns.</p>
<p>When you add the Cuomo decision, it certainly doesnt leave a good taste in the mouth.  It really <em>feels</em> like those people were killed.  </p>
<p>They were unnecessarily infected, which meant they unnecessarily were sent to the hospital, where they were unnecessarily ventilated, and as a result, they died.</p>
<p>That's not inaccurate, right?</p>

        <p>Cuomo had a pandemic hitting his state.  His response was to empty the hospitals to create open beds for infected people.  Part of emptying the hospitals was to send Covid+ elderly patients back to their nursing homes.  He <em>thought</em> he was creating an empty hospital bed for every nursing home patient he sent back,  when in fact, he was <em>creating dozens of newly infected elderly patients</em> every time he did it.  It was, quite possibly, the worst policy decision ever made.  And he will never, ever be held accountable.</p>

        <p>&rt; when in fact, he was creating dozens of newly infected elderly patients every time he did it.</p>
<p>Who would then get sent to the hospital where they would die by ventilator.</p>
<p>But .. isnt it kind of common knowledge, at least among medical people, that is what happened?</p>
<p>NYC, and what went on their in April, makes up a huge chunk of the total US losses, doesnt it?  Those deaths really shouldnt be looked at as Covid deaths for the purpose of determining "lockdown" or whatever, because nothing would have prevented those deaths.</p>

        <p>Not inaccurate.  I would say that murder may be too strong a term.  More like negligent homicide.</p>
