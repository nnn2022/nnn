        <p>I think they’re an island nation 2500 miles from any other inhabited land mass with a population less than the city I live in (not the state, the city. My city has a population of 5 million. NZ has 4.8 million people TOTAL on the entire island). I think continually comparing island nations to countries with massive land borders is futile and all it does is upset people. I am glad their economy hasn’t taken a hit. If all 5 million of their population is cool with never again having open borders and tourism, then good for them! They must have some serious mental fortitude to genuinely consider such a thing. I do not have that same fortitude and don’t know many that do but I’m not going to shit on them if that’s what they want for their future. But what they’ve done and are doing has worked for a literal handful of countries and they’re ALL islands. We can say “hey congrats NZ you didn’t completely nuke your economy with this shit” while not comparing them to the rest of the world. Getting real sick of people saying a country that NZ could fit in about 40 times could’ve done what they did. The US would’ve been called every name in the fucking book if we hard sealed our border with Mexico by the same people wondering why we can’t just be like New Zealand.</p>

        <p>Nope but if you got every single one of the 330 million Americans to not leave their homes for 8 weeks but left the borders open, that IS where transmission would come from and it would be unable to be tracked unlike NZ who knows exactly who is coming in through which borders.</p>

<p>I assume by detention centres you mean the 4 star hotels for people entering the country?</p>
<p>The biggest impact the people are happy with are sold out sporting venues and summer festivals. International corporations, like I dunno - Amazon - are doing just fine and can adapt.

<p>Yes, because they are centres of forcible detainment. </p>

<p>Then New Zealand - at least your industry - may be a real success story, thanks not only to the human reaction but to its geography and population density. That's definitely a good thing; I don't want to be salty about it! But so far, overall, corporations have excelled through special favours and exemptions where small businesses have been shuttered and hammered. Forgive my cynicism.</p>

        <p>That's the whole point of the 'hard and early' slogan they used. If you do it half assed for a long time those small people suffer. Instead everyone suffered for 6 weeks (+2 weeks later on for the big city) but went back to operating normally.</p>
<p>I also disagree with forceable detainment. It's a choice to enter the country and a condition of that choice is a two week stay in a hotel. If someone doesn't like it they can hang out somewhere else</p>

<p>Ah, universal surveillance of people’s movements is such a small price to pay for literally the exact same things everyone took for granted until this year. </p>
<p>By all means, make that tradeoff. Most will, because temporary comfort is more important than liberty and individual rights for most people. </p>
<p>But don’t sugarcoat what has happened: you’ve accepted a mass intrusion into your daily, private lives, and accompanying loss or privacy, in exchange for the government’s giving you back some of the rights and freedoms it took away from you. </p>
<p>It is no surprise that most people accept that “deal,” but it’s also not something to be proud of.</p>
