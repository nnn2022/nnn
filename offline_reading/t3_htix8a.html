    <strong>I gained 10 pounds since the lockdowns started</strong>
    <p><p>I gained 10 pounds since the lockdowns started in March. 
My weight has always been a struggle for me. I have always been “thick” or “chubby”. In high school, I basically starved myself down from 175 to 120 lbs and I still felt fat. A combination of seeing how boys treated my fat friend and stuff written by trolls on 4chan (lol) made me very complex about my body. 
I managed to maintain my weight through college, but the working world has been tough. Sitting at a desk all day, boredom, stress, fatigue, and not having anything to distract me from hunger  slowly but surely brought me to 157 pounds. 
I joined a gym in 2018, and loved exercising so much that I ended up going 5-6 days a week for 2-3 hours at a time. I didn’t lose weight the first year, but I gained muscle and looked a lot more “thick” and sculpted than “chubby”. 
I finally hunkered down in February and did another diet plan and finally got down to 150 lbs in 6 weeks. I was on the track to going even lower, and since I was working out so much I was looking more sculpted and lean despite weighing a lot. </p>
<p>Working out a lot also helped me immensely with my insomnia. I used to sometimes sleep 2-3 hours a night for a week straight simply because I couldn’t sleep. Vigorous exercise cured me. </p>
<p>Then the lockdowns happened. I was devastated. The gym was my happy place. I began to work out at home, but it was very different. I don’t have a stair master at home. I don’t have a variety weight machines at home. I don’t have tons of space and no distractions to keep me focused at home. 
I took about a month off from working out. Since I am an essential worker, I kept getting junk food like donuts for being a “hero”. Stress kept me up at night and gave me crippling insomnia and made me want late night snacks to quell my upset stomach so that I could sleep 5 hours instead of 2-3. 
I was too afraid to weigh myself for a long portion of time. But now I did, and I gained 10 pounds. I am back to 160, the heaviest weight I have been since high school. </p>
<p>I started to go to the gym again as soon as it opened. Folks on Reddit accused me of being the cause of the second wave and being selfish. Gym friends kept sending me articles about staff members at gyms who tested positive and warned me that it’s not safe to go back. My coworker warned me that the gym is extremely dangerous because everyone is short of breath. They made masks mandatory at the gym and I just tolerated it as best as I could. </p>
<p>The gym was taking so many precautions that I find it unbelievable that it was a hotbed of death. The staff was constantly disinfecting and everything was spread far apart. </p>
<p>I know online people say “JUST WORKOUT AT HOME” and “JUST EAT LESS”. But it’s hard when your support system and plan gets instantly destroyed. Twice. When you keep getting pats on the back for being a “hero” in the form of donuts. When you are home and have family, television, magazines, and being tired after work to make you lose focus and motivation to exercise. When you’re limited in space. When it’s 100 degrees outside and inside you don’t really have room to do anything. When you’re depressed and don’t know what will happen to your job in 6 months.</p></p>

        <p>I posted something similar and several commentators showed me their similar posts... just meaning you’re not along at all. Even people who never struggled with weight before are sliding that direction.</p>
<p>Of course we can’t work out in any way in gyms, but we can get unsupervised fast food from anywhere without even having to open the car door or sometimes without even leaving home. When obesity is a health risk above what it normally is.. it was before this, but now mUH CoVId is all the more reason we should have FOCUSED on helping people maintain or gain healthy habits. </p>
<p>Instead we got Pizza Hut making a box the size of a wading pool to fit the “cinnimon crap rolls you need in these trying times”. </p>
<p>Gym= instant death of hundreds 
Pizza Hut guy who hasn’t washed his uniform in a month lead alone refilled the restaurants soap= good choice because you staid home on your ass!</p>

        <p>Thirty here. Worked my ass off. The gym was a vice. I at first I understood the logic but then I saw what was being promoted. Staying home on your ass. Ordering bigger cheaper takeout than ever before. Getting shitfaced. Those are the legal things that ruin lives so just imagine how many fell back into hard drugs or whatever else. </p>
<p>You can always tell whose never committed to a gym by who says “can’t you just do it at home”.</p>

        <p>I never used the gym. I just ate healthier (counted calories) and did walking. Plus I was just in better spirits too, which my doctor says stress makes you gain weight. It was enough to slim me down a ton, which shocked me. But I still think gyms should be open, and it's beneficial for many people.</p>

<p>Do you find yourself resenting that "essential worker hero" thing?  I work in transportation, and so I've been going to work like I always do, and I <em>really</em> resent being called an essential worker and being told what an alleged hero I am.  The hell with all of it.  I just want to go to work and do my job with the minimal amount of bullshit.  My employer has a big banner up that says "thank you for being brave", and I really want to just pull it down.</p>

        <p>I've bought a pull up bar and a couple dumbbells.    <br>
I lost like 15 pounds of muscle these months.  <br>
My gym opened but with stupid requirements and will likely close again in the winter so I thought it's better investing that monthly money in this.      <br>
I might buy a stationary bike if things get worse, maybe more weights. Space is tight but it is what it is.      </p>

        <p>I had the same problem. After a couple months in lockdown I was at my worst ever. I knew I had to do something or it was going to keep getting worse and worse since there’s no end in sight. </p>
<p>I reconnected with an old friend who had finally lost her pregnancy weight and was feeling really good and she hooked me up with this private Facebook group to get the support and for accountability. I check in at least daily and I use a streaming service that has over 1k videos in many different programs to choose from depending what kind of workout you “like”.</p>
<p>Things have been really turning around! Been consistently losing just over 2 pounds each week since I started!</p>

        <p>My gym opened and requires masks. No one says anything of you lower it during intense cardio but it’s made it so much different. Now when I go I can’t wait to just get out because it’s not an escape anymore it’s the same weird feeling everywhere has now.</p>
<p>I go to a machine well away from people and fully take the mask off. For awhile lots were doing that but ok the only One lately. Just try not to worry if ppl complaining to management or if it’s scaring people. I just have to have a semblance of that free heathy feeing, or I’ll die, very slowly from having all my life saving good habits become stigmatized.</p>
