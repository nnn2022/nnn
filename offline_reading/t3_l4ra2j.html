    <strong>The Symbolism of Masks</strong>
    <p><p>As far as I'm concerned, masks (whether you wear one or not) are a matter of symbolism. And symbolism matters. </p>
<p>To wear one is to perpetuate the grim state that we are in - in the grip of authoritarianism under the pretext of a virus (which is no where near as dangerous as often believed). To not wear one is a powerful symbol that you are not convinced that these authoritarian measures are justified.</p>
<p>Here's an analogy for who doubt the power of symbolism. Let's say you have a romantic partner. You have been together for years, and each day, without failure, they have given you a kiss before going to work. Then, suddenly, one day comes along where they fail to give you a kiss. What does that symbolise? </p>
<p>Let's stop kissing the backside of the authoritarian governments.</p></p>
