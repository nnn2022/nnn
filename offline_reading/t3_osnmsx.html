    <strong>Recalling School Boards</strong>
    <p><p>Why aren't people recalling school boards that require masks?  </p>
<p>For example, I looked up the recall rules in Kansas for the Shawnee Mission School Board.</p>
<p>Recall petitions in Kansas must be signed by 40% of the number of voters that vote in the last election for that office. </p>
<p>That might seem like a lot, until you realize that probably only about 5% of eligible voters vote in school board elections. (I've never voted for a school board before, nor would I have cared to do so before COVID.)</p>
<p>Therefore, you'd probably only need signatures from about 2% of eligible voters in the Shawnee Mission District in order to recall the school board.</p></p>

        <p>&rt; Why aren't people recalling school boards that require masks?</p>
<p>Hopefully because less than 50% of the population is as dumb as you, which means the measure wouldn't pass even if it did go to ballot</p>
