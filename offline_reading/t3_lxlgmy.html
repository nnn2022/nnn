    <strong>What Would it Take?</strong>
    <p><p>What would it take to convince you that masks, social distancing, and lockdowns are necessary?</p>
<p>I'm asking this question in good faith. I am not here to ridicule anyone's opinions. In the spirit of transparency, my opinions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe there is abundant evidence and mechanistic logic to support the use of masks and social distancing.</li>
<li>I am conflicted about lockdowns and mandatory business closures.</li>
</ul>
<p>I strive to be open-minded, and I have close friends who are staunch anti-maskers. I find it difficult to have an open and honest dialogue about this subject, and I'm hoping that this is the right place to do that. Looking forward to your replies.</p>
<p>EDIT (40 minutes in): I'm very pleased by how many comments already came in, and I'm looking forward to replying to each of them. I'm sorry to see that my post was downvoted, and I would love to know why. I realize that this sub is intended for people who are already in agreement on this issue, but there are specific flairs for "Question" and "Opposing Viewpoint," and I interpreted that as an invitation.</p>
<p>EDIT (3 hours in): Your comments continue to impress me in both their civility and their rigor, with some exceptions. I wish I had time to respond to everyone right away, but realistically it will probably take me a couple days. I hope that you stick around and continue to respond to my replies. Thanks to everyone who took the time to engage with me on this difficult subject.</p></p>

        <p>Try saying that to them though. There is a distinct disconnect here between what you’ve been exposed to vs what they have been exposed to. And saying anything to the contrary automatically makes you a “terrorist” or some other crazy insult. I really don’t understand at the moment</p>

        <p>How do you define "one foot in the grave"? AFAIK, many people who died were just old, they had no life-threatening comorbidities.</p>
<p>For example, my friend's grandma contracted the virus, she was over 80 years old, healthy and active, and then within 10 days of symptoms she was dead. I'm not asking you to believe this anecdote, but I would ask you to entertain the possibility, and tell me how would you respond if it was your friend's grandma. By my definition, she certainly did not have one foot in the grave before contracting the virus.</p>

        <p>But it's not possible to know that. A person who died of Covid could have potentially lived another 5 or 10 or 20 years (although rare, we've certainly seen instances of Humans who live to be 80 to 100). </p>

        <p>Yes it is possible to know this. The average covid fatality had a minimum of 3 other serious health complications that would lead to death inside of a year. These were in nearly all cases terminal patients waiting for death already.</p>

<p>I have seen data that indicates that about 9/10 deaths occur in people with at least one comorbidity, but you have to admit that asthma and hypertension are different from terminal illness. </p>

        <p>In my community we have already seen a huge surge in domestic violence and OD's. I haven't studied national or global statistics about that, but it will probably become clear later on as you said. </p>
<p>People like me, who prefer to accept the official wisdom, have to admit that we consider this a necessary sacrifice, just as people like you have to admit that you consider some amount of COVID-19 death to be acceptable relative to the consequences of lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Except one group of deaths is hypothetical based on modeling the other is demonstrable and directly at the hands of the government. This should be any easy choice especially since several control populations exist that had equal covid mortality and avoided the collateral damage.  See Sweden, South Dakota, Florida etc.</p>

        <p>This is by far the most compelling argument I've encountered from those opposed to strict lockdowns. Indeed, most of the research I have seen tends to cast aspersions on the efficacy of lockdowns. I have been skeptical about lockdowns from the beginning, because I doubt that they substantially reduce case incidence, and they are by far the most extreme infringement upon individual rights. </p>

<p>However, rapid border closures make a lot of sense to me during a global pandemic. I am fairly convinced that many thousands of lives could have been saved if the U.S. had imposed stricter travel restrictions in early 2020.</p>

        <p>The science is certainly fallible, but the recommendation that the general public shouldn't wear masks wasn't based on science, it was simply a policy decision that they justified at the time based on concerns over mask shortages for healthcare workers.

        <p>OK, let me make this easier for you because you are clearly missing the point. The CDC was created in 1946. Why hasn't the CDC EVER encouraged mask usage between 1946 and 2020? Are you telling me that the efficacy of masks against respiratory infections was unknown for all those decades until 2020?</p>

        <p>I did miss the point, thanks for clarifying. </p>
<p>The counterargument is that COVID-19 is the only respiratory infection which is sufficiently infectious and fatal to warrant mask mandates. If you disagree that COVID-19 is more dangerous than the flu, that's a different story which I am open to discussing. The mainstream data all suggests that it is significantly more fatal than the flu, particularly for high-risk groups. </p>
<p>We can't blindly trust statistics, but my reason for adopting extreme caution is that there's at least a 50% chance that the virus is as bad as they say it is.</p>

        <p>Masks are useless, especially when people aren’t sick. Assuming they do anything against viruses which pass through the majority of “face coverings”, even if they did do anything people are wearing them and aren’t sick. Why are we treating healthy people like lepers? Asymptomatic spread is rare and does not drive outbreaks. The PCR test gives false positives at the high cycle rates they are being used at (but that cycle rate was lowered in January by the WHO and more thorough diagnosis was required for each positive PCR test, which is why “cases” are decreasing). </p>
<p>https://www.who.int/news/item/20-01-2021-who-information-notice-for-ivd-users-2020-05</p>
<p>The death statistics from the virus are inflated due to the PCR test having high false positive rates. The inventor of the PCR test, Kary Mullis, has stated that the PCR test has been misused by the medical community.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/oaOZIcsicvM</p>
<p>Kary Mullis also heavily criticized Tony Fauci.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/qPJnBSh_gXQ</p>
<p>So we have been living under the deception of a casedemic, and the reason why the majority of people who “die from Covid” are very old, and usually in nursing homes is because people who are very old and in nursing homes die a lot regardless of the year. That’s also why 94% of those who “died from Covid” had multiple comorbidities, according to the CDC. The average age of death from Covid is higher than the average age of death, that should be all you need to know.</p>

        <p>Do you understand how infectious diseases work ?... People NOT wearing masks are the ones spreading it to others. </p>
<p>The point of wearing a mask is not to protect yourself. It's to prevent YOU from unknowingly spreading to others. </p>
<p>You can be asymptomatic (showing no signs of being infected) for 4 to 14 days before realizing you even have Covid19. That means you can be unknowingly spreading the disease. </p>
<p>Breaking that chain is what Masks help accomplish.</p>

<p>Considering that influenza cases have collapsed between 98.5% (southern hemisphere) and 99.5% (northern hemisphere) it would make sense why Cooties 19 is killing 48x more than the influenza, wouldn't it?</p>

        <p>&rt;You do realize there are historical pictures of people wearing masks in 1918,.. right?.. Or do you think those pictures are "fake news" ?... </p>
<p>I'm not talking about 1918 I'm talking about all these days that you have lived before covid why didn't you use a mask?</p>
<p>&rt;SARS-Cov2 is killing people at a rate 48x higher than the Flu. </p>
<p>But the numbers is not accurate and flu infections has been counted as covid </p>
<p>&rt;Because Masks and social-distancing work. Flu can't spread if people don't congregate in large groups. That's exactly why Masks and social-distancing are effective.</p>
<p>If that worked for flu why don't it work for covid?</p>
<p>My question still not been answered, what's the difference between covid and flu that has been disappeared?  Flu was also a infectious virus but we could all just live a normal live, do we need restrictions for every flu like disease?</p>

        <p>This is an interesting question, I prefer to wear an n95 with a cloth mask covering it, but I ran out of n95's a long time ago. </p>
<p>The obvious answer is that filtration masks are much more expensive, and the U.S. population is too vast to provide a constant supply of n95's for everyone.</p>

        <p>I'm not afraid of the truth, I'm afraid of the virus. I was initially skeptical about the danger of the virus, but I trust the data and study it closely. I also have a number of high-risk family members, so I can't afford to gamble. </p>
<p>"Masks slow the spread" makes physical sense to me, because the fabric membrane slows down the exhaled air velocity, thereby reducing the volume of contaminated air surrounding each infected person's face. So, combined with the statistical evidence, I find the case for masks to be pretty convincing.</p>

        <p>Evidence that the positive impact of the measure is less than the negative impact.</p>
<p>To break that down:</p>
<ul>
<li>evidence of efficacy of the measure</li>
<li>evidence of the DEGREE of efficacy of the measure</li>
<li>assessment of cost of the measure</li>
<li>discussion about the relative weights of the above</li>
</ul>
<p>So, Lockdowns:</p>
<ul>
<li>do lockdowns impact the spread?  if early enough and severe enough, sure.  NZ did by shutting down access to the island and everything within.  the rest of the world was exposed and had the virus circulating for months prior to dicussion, much less action.</li>
<li>to what degree do lockdowns of a given stringency work?  we can't close <em>everything</em> for long enough, because coronaviruses can remain dormant for weeks (antarctica study regarding colds hiding for 17 weeks), and people need to supply food, utilities, raw goods, emergency services, home/car repair, etc., etc.  not one country managed to control the spread of covid despite widely varying levels of control imposed</li>
<li>the downsides are manifold.  there's a post here which begins to enumerate the different types of impact, but hundreds of millions impacted without jobs, without access to basic needs (sanitary products?), without access to enough food, without school, without emotional support, people locked away, people not getting treatments for cancer, not getting screenings for diseases, childhood vaccinations down 40%(!), terribly impacts on our immune systems by NOT being exposed to mild diseases, and myriad others.  The impact on the freedoms of the western world may even have larger repercussions over the longer term, not to diminish the tens of millions who will starve to death in the next few years because of this.</li>
<li>so we compare these.  does that list of negative impacts outweigh the gains we have seen from lockdowns.  in my estimation, quite clearly.  end the lockdowns.  all of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do the same with masks.  There is similarly no evidence for significant impact on spread based on mask mandates/usage.  The negative impacts aren't as bad as lockdowns (for adults, for kids they're practically abuse), but the gains still aren't there.</p>
<p>This is the same all around.  The biggest statistical contributers to a country's/state's/region's impact from covid are health and climate.  Everything else is completely negligible.  We're literally generating a new great depression for no benefit.</p>
<p>Until there is some evidence that any of this has worked or might work, and do so greatly in excess of the horrific costs, I will remain staunchly against any and all such measures.</p>

        <p>&rt;So, Lockdowns:</p>
<p>I have always been skeptical about lockdowns, and maybe I should make a new thread to discuss that topic separately from the mandatory masks/social distancing question. I think it's unfortunate that some people feel so marginalized by the lockdowns that they are compelled to regard all of the mitigation measures as a monolithic threat to their individual rights.</p>
<p>&rt;There is similarly no evidence for significant impact on spread based  on mask mandates/usage.</p>
<p>I would check out this Wired article that was posted by /u/Meatmops: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-face-mask-debate-reveals-a-scientific-double-standard/">https://www.wired.com/story/the-face-mask-debate-reveals-a-scientific-double-standard/</a></p>
<p>&rt; ...for kids, [masks are] practically abuse...</p>
<p>How so? I don't have kids, and I have no idea what you mean by this.</p>
<p>&rt;The biggest statistical contributers to a country's/state's/region's impact from covid are health and climate.  </p>
<p>AFAIK, this assertion is pretty well supported by the larger studies. But that doesn't mean that masks and social-distancing are ineffective, it just means that government intervention has been largely ineffective. </p>

        <p>Interesting, I haven't heard from the "asymptomatic people shouldn't have to wear masks or social distance" crowd much lately, but I have seen more recent data that suggests that asymptomatic spread is less significant than earlier estimates indicated. Still, how do you account for the incubation period? What if you're sitting in a bus and you suddenly experience symptom onset, even though you felt fine when you left the house?</p>

        <p>The burden of proof is on the government, not me. That's the point. </p>
<p>Broad-sweeping lockdown mandates imply that I am a danger at all times to everyone around me. The government should not be treating all of their citizens as potential threats to be neutralized. If you want to take away a citizen's basic human rights (peaceful assembly and free association), they need to either have committed a crime and gone through due process, or they need to actively be a clear-and-present danger. At the moment, I am neither</p>

        <p>Got it thanks for the response. My experience has been different. </p>
<p>My dad is an infectious disease doctor, sister an ICU nurse, best friend of 20+ years is a doctor also, and I have a friend who is an immunologist and one who is an epidemiologist, and I try to make sure to run any questions I have by them. </p>
<p>I haven’t had your experience where they are not in favor of precautions. However, they are great at explaining their reasoning. So it’s not just “masks save lives” , rather “masks help some people remember not to touch their mouth and nose constantly [something I am guilty of], and offer some protection to those around you if you are sick”. And more in depth explanations of precautions &amp; what they do, the virus, the vaccine, what’s going on in the hospitals, etc. </p>
<p>If I didn’t have people I trusted giving me the info, or if they gave me different info, I would likely been in a different mindset. So I get that if your sources are telling you that the precautions aren’t necessary that you would trust them, that is what I do. If mine told me there’s no reason to wear masks or social distance and explained why, I would trust them too.</p>

It's hard for me to imagine it's all a lie when I hear the pleas of real live healthcare workers in my community, begging us to adhere to the restrictions.

<p>There isn't. Overwhelming majority wore masks since March &amp; it did jackshit. What's the difference in Florida and South Dakota and every other state? No rise in fallen troopers after: BLM protest, Biden rallies or any of your year long national sports. So social distance doesn't do shit either.

<p>I really don't think that, that's why I made this thread. I know that there must be some good reasons why so many people are skeptical about these measures, and I want to understand them better. </p>
<p>My interpretation of the data about masks is the opposite of yours, but I will take another look at the comparisons between states with and without mandates with your points in mind. </p>
<p>Aside from that though, masks and social distancing make physical sense to me, as methods of slowing the spread of an airborne virus. In other words, regardless of the data, how could masks and social distancing NOT slow the spread of a virus that comes out of people's mouths, and can only travel so far through the air?</p>

        <p>What would it take to convince you they DON'T work?</p>
<p>I believe there is abundant evidence that lockdowns have caused signficant damage to society and the economy, and only serve the economic interests of certain large corporations.</p>
<p>I have also seen abundant evidence that the kinds of masks being used by the general public are completely useless at stopping water vapor.  </p>
<p>Comparisons between locked down and open countries show similar epidemiological curves.  Sometimes, the locked down counties have worse curves.</p>
<p>In all of human history, healthy people have never been quarantined.</p>
<p>Based on the data I've seen, the 'epidemic' was over last summer.  The virus has been endemic for some time.   Politicians do not use data on the actually-sick people, but instead based on positive test rates.   Positive tests are not an indicator of actual disease or infection, but usually imply exposure.</p>
<p>We are simply hurting our society for no real gain.  It's health theater.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns:</p>
<p>A few week lockdown to delay the spread while the govt increases hospital capacity? Sure. </p>
<p>A year long lockdown to save lives, when the average age of covid deaths is 82 and half of people at risk of covid would rather live their life instead of hiding from death? Absolutely nothing will ever convince me that is necessary. </p>
<p>When you weigh the pros and cons of a year long lockdown it's pretty clear the cure is worse than the disease.</p>
<p>Social distancing:</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by that, do you mean people keeping their distance from others in public? Absolutely, that should always be necessary. I don't want strangers breathing on me on public transport etc.</p>
<p>If you mean people not seeing their friends and family in person? Nothing will convince that is necessary for a year. Actually, it's not about it being necessary, it's about the fact that it should be a personal choice, no one should have the right to ban you from seeing your friends and family. </p>
<p>Masks:</p>
<p>Nothing because from my understanding masks only work if they're not made of cloth, if you dispose of them after a short period of time and if you do not touch them or your face until it's time to take it off and dispose of it.  The majority of people slap on a dirty cloth mask that they made from an old t-shirt, haven't washed in weeks, touch it constantly, pull it up and down and then put it in their dirty pocket until it's time to put it on again. </p>
<p>Sorry, but you couldn't pay me to believe masks protect anyone from anything the way people wear them. If anything, wearing a dirty piece of cloth over your mouth for hours probably makes you less healthy.</p>

        <p>I commented on a r/politicalhumor post about how terrible Abbott is for getting rid of lockdowns and I got swarmed. Some guy messaged me saying he wishes I was dead lol. I’m not entirely sure what’s going on with these people tbh. Not sure if they’re just terrified due to media / social media or what is happening.</p>

        <p>lots of people come pretending to ask questions, then just insult and troll. if you are curios you can read other posts, not just ask and leave too.

        <p>What would it take to get me to wear a mask?</p>
<p>Well if they didnt put out BS about the mask and virus.
1."virus" having 10 years in medical field as a military nurse I would say know a few things. That being said when covid came about and had the whole world freaking out I was truly baffled because medical journals correlate covid as virus that cause the common cold. I can only speak for the providers I work along with at my hospital and we all say covid is BS. </p>
<p>2."mask" let's just say this was an actual harmful as in fatal virus and airborne I would NOT promote cloth masks at all! That does nothing if not increase the chance of you getting ill. Big take I know majority people dont wash those so your it's on your face your breath keeping it warm and moist creating a fields for growth of that of what the mask was ment to protect you from. 
A proper mask we get is N-95 and we have to get "training" really its identifying your mask size and figuring out proper seal and we do an odor test so if you cant smell your got a good mask</p>

<p>I would love to see those journal articles, and to hear from your colleagues. I have not seen any such statements from mainstream sources.</p>

<p>Great points about masks, indeed misuse of masks is rampant, which is one of the reasons why it's so difficult to study their efficacy on a large scale. However, you seem to be ignoring the fact that the official recommendations about cloth masks are to clean and replace them frequently, and to use them in order to protect others, not yourself.</p>
