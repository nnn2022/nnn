        <p>&rt; So if it doesn't stop all particles and can't block out the main particles (the covid 19 particles) then what does it stop??? </p>
<p>You're conflating the size of the covid virus and the size of the particles they are attached to. The vapour from your breath is what carries the virus, that is what is mostly blocked by the mask.</p>
<p>&rt;And masks have their dangers such as being hard to read facial expressions, hard to hear people, removes colour from people and a unwashed cloth mask could even result in higher chance of infection, masks like the N95 reduce oxygen by 5-20% and more prone to headaches</p>
<p>Lets go through this. Most expressions heavily rely on the parts of the face uncovered by a mask. If you smile you will see your eyes move too. Angry faces will acheieve the opposite effect with the skin around your eyes and eyebrows being pulled down. Yes, it may make some expressions slightly harder to understand but that's easily fixable if you just listen to the person and what they say. </p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4873105/</p>
<p>If masks make it hard for you to hear people then you may need to visit an audiologist or just a hearing aid specialist.</p>
<p>I have no idea what "removing colour from people" means. Like having a tan line or something? If that's an issue you can just go outside and tan your face when you're alone or with family.</p>
<p>And people wearing unwashed face masks is just the same as people wearing unwashed clothes. That's an issue of the people that don't wash the mask. If they get washable masks or recycleable ones then there are no issues.</p>
<p>You are correct about N95 masks impeding gaseous exchange (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647822/) but since a stupidly small percentage of people use that high grade of a mask it will affect nobody except the few that choose themselves to take that extra mile for their protection. It will barely affect those people too unless they spend all their time wearing those masks. Usually people will pop a mask on to do their shopping and they'll take it off once done essentially undoing the effects incurred while wearing the mask. And hey, what's a small headache (if you even get one) compared to a virus that will affect your lungs for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>As an extra note, if you really are worried about the oxygen intake if you ever end up wearing an N95 mask (as unlikely as that'll be) you can do some physical excercise and when you're fit you'll pretty much negate the ~10-20% difference in your gaseous exchange. That small gaseous exchange hit will only affect the extremely unhealthy.</p>

        <p>&rt; Hard to hear cause everyone sounds muffled </p>
<p>The muffling caused by a piece of cloth is so incredibly small I can't see how that will affect anyone without a bad speech impediment. </p>
<p>&rt;I mean colour by everyone looks robotic, you can't see their smile, as someone who relys and studies facial expressions it's just not the same with a mask and harder to tell if someone is lying, being deceiving, genuinely happy or not </p>
<p>Right so if you study facial expressions you can test those who want to be a part of the study for covid and if they don't have it they don't need to wear a mask in the tests. Problem solved.</p>
<p>How often do you need to know whether or not someone is lying? It sounds like a strange issue unless you're a detective or interrogator or something. But then again in those cases you can just get a quick covid test on the person you're speaking to and problem solved.</p>
<p>&rt;And if masks were so affective as you state why have states and places that mandated it (France, UK, Argentina, Vermont, California, some parts of Germany) had a increase in cases after 2-3 weeks of the mandate shouldn't it of gone down?</p>
<p>Once again, nobody said masks were 100% effective. Masks serve to limit slightly how many possible infections can be spread. For example, (these are going to be wildly exaggerated numbers just for show) say 1000 people got a virus of some kind that is spread by air and there were no masks or lockdowns in place the virus would run rampant over a few weeks maybe even reaching 100s of thousands of people. If you did have lockdowns and masks you'd limit how many people are going to bars, and many other activities (yes, that sucks, but not enough to let people die). So already that's thousands less people being infected by this virus. The added bonus is that when people <strong>need</strong> to go outside they wear a mask that helps reduce their capabilities of spreading said virus. Even if that capability is reduced by 75% that still means 25% of people won't be infected. That means instead of 100s of thousands being infected it may only be half of that or maybe even less.</p>
<p>It's all about adding things into a large puzzle of some kind to reduce the spread and danger of the disease. </p>
<p>In future when the cases go down that's when restrictions can ease up (much like where I live I went out to the city and went to many bars and clubs for my sisters birthday).</p>

        <p>So where have masks been effective? If no places with mask mandates been deemed successful what's the evidence, and dunno about you but you can't compare human facial expressions and character to someone wearing a dehumanising mask, it makes everyone look the same goes back removing character of someone</p>

        <p>Australia seems to be alright with their use of masks. I don't know any stats on the specifics of mask usage to the point where I can name places it was effective though. It's one of those things where just because you can't actively see it working that doesn't mean it isn't working at all.</p>

        <p>It’s better then wearing nothing though, it still stops some particles. Here’s an analogy, a seatbelt significantly reduces the risk of death in a car accident, but there is still a chance of injury and or death. So, since you could still die, why would you wear a seatbelt. Right?</p>

        <p>HAHAHHAHA OMG</p>
<p>Ok you are sooo wrong about this, heres why:</p>
<p>Masks, as long as they are the surgical kind (the blue/white ones) are literally made to not let anything through except air. Surgeons need masks that don’t let anything through since they operate on patients and a mask which lets droplets through isn’t acceptable. If you take a surgical mask, you can Literally use it as a cup of water if its straight out of the packaging. It doesn’t let ANYTHING through except air, which is much much smaller than the covid-19 particles jesus christ you guys are unbelievably stupid</p>

        <p>So your basically saying surgical masks are fucking bullet proof if that's the case why do we need the lockdown if we have surgical masks and if the N95 mask which considered "the gold standard" that only blocks 0.3 microns whilst the covid 19 particle is 0.06-0.12 microns</p>
<p>And surgical masks only block LARGE droplets</p>

        <p>We need masks cuz u people are not listening and spread the virus. Take a look at New Zealand. They immediately told everyone: „2 weeks quarantine, everyone wears masks if they have to go outside, only essential workers go outside to work, everyone gets money every month since you won’t work. No one gets into the country and no one gets out.“ everyone listens, everyone helps.
Boom. New Zealand has 0 cases atm.</p>

        <p>New Zealand is on their 3rd lockdown (or is it their 3rd reopening. It's hard to keep track) because each time they open back up, people get sick. We have never eliminated a virus by hiding from it, only by gaining immunity. As long as New Zealand prevents people from interacting, cases will stagnate... until they open again. If everybody is listening and the protections work, then how are they getting new cases?</p>

        <p>Does it? I haven’t seen any actual proof that happens. Why has every city / state / country with a mask ordinance have had cases climb (and continue to climb - right now we’re at 6 months of ordinances) if that’s true?</p>
<p>You can show me studies of people spitting at each other in labs all day, but where are the studies that prove actual human regular usage has any impact on COVID?</p>

        <p>Ah i see what happened here with you.
This is a formal fallacy, a common mistake of reasoning. If you say that every state with mire people wearing masks is also experiencing a rising amount of COVID-19 Cases, that does NOT imply that masks cause COVID-19, even though the amount of people who wear masks and people infected by COVID-19 behave similar.
Now, if you take a little bit of common sense into this as well, you will notice that masks do actually make sense, since states with higher covid cases need more people to wear masks than, lets say, New Zealand (0 cases atm) so that means: more cases in a country/state, more people will need to wear masks. Now, of course if everyone would wear a mask and no one would be stupid enough (like some people in this sub) to rebel against this, then you would see the numbers go down and the curve will flatten. But since you tell yourself and everyone you know that masks are bad, less people will wear them, thus resulting in more people getting infected if individuals infected with Covid refuses to wear their masks. You can go to literally anyone qualified enough in the medical industry or also anyone outside of the USA and they will tell you that masks are useful and why. Personally, i believe that not the ones that wear masks and care for their own and others health are the sheep, but rather the ones that refuse to do that and put everyone in their city at risk.</p>
