    <strong>An Overview of Ontario’s legal powers under EMCPA: Is there any likelihood of legal challenge to Ontario lockdowns?</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.mccarthy.ca/en/insights/articles/covid-19-can-they-do-part-i-ontarios-emergency-management-and-civil-protection-act</p>
<p>Very well written article from Eric S Block and Adam Goldenberg, respectively partner and associate at McCarthy Tetrault, a Toronto based law firm.</p>
<p>Reading their analysis of the EMCPA, it seems there could potentially be several grounds for legal challenge of the provincial emergency declaration and associated lockdown orders, both constitutional or under judicial review:</p>
<p>&rt; The Divisional Court – or, in urgent circumstances, the Superior Court of Justice – could, in theory, quash an emergency declaration or order pursuant to ss. 2 and 6 of the Judicial Review Procedure Act because:</p>
<p>&rt; Cabinet or the Premier erroneously concluded that the criteria for declaring an “emergency” were satisfied;
Cabinet exceeded the limits on its power to make orders under s. 7.0.2(4) of the EMCPA, by:
making an order that does not fit into, or is not consistent with, the powers specified in s. 7.0.2(4) of the EMCPA;
not believing (or not reasonably believing) that an order was “necessary and essential in the circumstances”, that it would be effective, or that it was a reasonable alternative to other measures; or
making or implementing an order in a manner that did not limit its intrusiveness, geographic scope, or duration.</p>
<p>Given that now we have more data about the virus and its (lack of) significant lethal potency, it would seem to me that it could be demonstrated that the province has overreacted in their response.</p>
<p>Then there is the subject of constitutional challenge:</p>
<p>&rt; If an order made under the EMCPA (or a provision of the legislation itself) were challenged on constitutional grounds, and if the court concluded that the order (or provision) limited a Charter right, then the government would have to satisfy the court that the limit on the Charter right was (or is) “reasonable”, “prescribed by law”, and “demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society” under s. 1 of the Charter. Whether the government would succeed in this would depend on the facts, but Cabinet’s assessment of the costs and benefits of its emergency response would likely receive considerable deference.</p>
<p>Examples of such a violation of the charter rights are given in the article:</p>
<p>&rt; * an order that restricts or prohibits individuals’ movements “to, from or within any specified area” under s. 7.0.2(4)2 of the EMCPA could limit the “freedom of peaceful assembly” under s. 2(c) of the Charter, or “the right … to move to and take up residence in any province” under s. 6(2)(a) of the Charter, or even “the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned” under s. 9 of the Charter;</p>
<p>&rt; * an order that “[c]los[es] a[] place, whether public or private”, such as “a[] business, office, school, hospital or other establishment or institution” under s. 7.0.2(4)5 of the EMCPA could, depending on the circumstances, limit “the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice” under s. 7 of the Charter, or “the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination” under s. 15(1) of the Charter; and</p>
<p>&rt; * an order that requires the “collect[ion], use or disclos[ure] [of] information” under 7.0.2(4)13 of the EMCPA could limit “the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure” under s. 8 of the Charter.</p>
<p>It seems the Hudsons Bay Company’s challenge of the lockdown orders was unsuccessful: </p>

<p>It would be interesting to know more about the court’s decision and whether HBC are considering appealing the decision.</p>
<p>Is there any realistic chance at a legal challenge to get us out of this mess?</p></p>

        <p>It’s unfortunate that based on the FP article the HBC cases wasn’t really about the lockdowns as a whole but only the ‘fairness’ of closing some stores while keeping others open. It seems to me that if a case was made regarding the empirical efficacy of lockdowns in general, rather than just the logic of dividing stores according to essentiality there would be more of a chance</p>
