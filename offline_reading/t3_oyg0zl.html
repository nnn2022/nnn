    <strong>Path of the Great Reset: what they don't tell you about the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus and the infamous global vaccine campaign.</strong>
    <p><p>https://preview.redd.it/06k7guxw3jf71.png?width=928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c6f3b4c960cf6daf04f8623ec372eaa52eea441</p>
<p>The fundamental issue with the global mRNA and DNA-based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus) and Covid-19 (the disease) is that these vaccines <strong>permanently alter a person’s DNA</strong>, referred to as the ‘host DNA’.</p>
<p>One of the critical mechanisms leading to changes in the host DNA is the presence within both the virus and its vaccines of genetic materials incorporated from HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus).1</p>
<p>A second mechanism which results in changes to the host DNA is a process called reverse transcription,4 and this is a process that occurs in stem cells. Stem cells develop into many different types of cells in the body. In the case of reverse transcription, the stem cells are genetically modified, replicate, and amplify to a large portion of cells that make up the tissues of the body. Stem cells serve as a reservoir to produce new cells in a perpetual fashion. In this way, over time, a large percentage of our somatic (non-reproductive) cells can be replaced by these genetically modified stem-cell precursor cells.2</p>
<p>This process carries over into the reproductive system of the individual and results in the transfer of genetic modification to the germline cells (egg and sperm). This insertional genetic mutation would find itself in all future generations stemming from this individual(s). Because this is a germline modification and not a somatic modification, this new genetic element will be present in every single cell of these individuals, wholly changing their body's genome.2</p>
<p><strong>The Coronavirus pandemic is the excuse to vaccinate all with the mark of the Great Reset.</strong> The coronavirus is behaving as all Lentiviruses do, and that is to alter the host's DNA, enabling the virus to go on and infect other healthy cells. The level of changes in the DNA as a result of having been vaccinated is quite different than that of the virus due to the additional technological components included within them. Additionally, the actual re-arrangement of genes in a new sequence is more extensive than the pattern altered by the viral genes themselves.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/tydawae04jf71.png?width=1365&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b071a35ee62e7d115ee716e5aa3501284b6c971</p>
<p>According to Nobel prize laurate Dr. Luc Montagnier (the discoverer of HIV) and other researchers, there are 16 genetic fragments of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV contained within the overall genomic sequence of the Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.1 This sequence, a series of genes, is known as mRNA, or ‘messenger’ RNA. These same genetic fragments are also present within vaccines employing mRNA such as Pfizer and Moderna. While Johnson &amp; Johnson utilizes DNA, as do other companies, mRNA is still present, along with these 16 genetic fragments.</p>
<p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a Lentivirus, a subgroup of retroviruses that cause chronic and deadly diseases characterized by long incubation periods. Lentiviruses integrate viral DNA into the DNA of a host cell, permanently altering it and the descendants of the host. A retrovirus is a type of virus that inserts a copy of its RNA genome into the DNA of a host cell that it invades, thus permanently changing the genome of that cell.</p>
<p>There is yet another mechanism at work in the alteration of the host DNA by HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV. There is a third strand of DNA referred to as a "central DNA flap" that ensures the integration of the viral DNA.3 Due to the presence of the genetic fragments of HIV, this DNA flap is found in not only the virus SARS-CoV-2, but also within the mRNA and DNA-based vaccines.</p>
<p>Typically vaccines have been derived by utilizing the virus to stimulate the production of antibodies by the individual's immune system in order to provide immunity without inducing the disease. The genetic materials of the virus are used to produce a vaccine against it. Thus, the concern here is in regard to the 16 genetic fragments of the Lentivirus HIV, a retrovirus, which are present in all gene-based vaccines for the virus, SARS-CoV-2. Both the virus and the vaccines permanently alter the DNA of a person.</p>

A capsid containing the virus’s genome and proteins then enters the cell. The shell of the capsid disintegrates and the HIV protein called reverse transcriptase transcribes the viral RNA into DNA. The viral DNA is transported across the nucleus, where the HIV Integrase protein integrates the HIV DNA into the host’s DNA. The host’s normal transcription machinery transcribes HIV DNA into multiple copies of new HIV RNA. Some of this RNA becomes the genome of a new virus, while the cell uses other copies of the RNA to make new HIV proteins. The new viral RNA and HIV proteins move to the surface of the cell, where a new, immature HIV forms. Finally, the virus is released from the cell, and the HIV protein called protease cleaves newly synthesized polyproteins to create a mature infectious virus. https:\/\/www.niaid.nih.gov\/diseases-conditions\/hiv-replication-cycle</a></p>
<p>The world is currently undergoing a Great Reset and the rabid global vaccination campaign constitutes the distribution of the biblical "Mark of the Beast" (Revelation 13:6,17,18 and 14:9-11).</p>
<p>In combination with the genetic alterations induced by this virus and its vaccines, <strong>the vaccines themselves contain components marking, or indicating the DNA has undergone these changes</strong>. There are several aspects to the mark, including both biological and spiritual.</p>
<p>Briefly, the merging of the biological with the technological. In addition to the genetic materials previously cited, the vaccines were developed with the aid of a firefly enzyme known as Luciferase, which is not present in the current vaccines but will be present in the next vaccines which are arriving very imminently (more on that later). Luciferase is a fluorescent material not visible to the naked eye, but is visible using computer applications and scanning devices. Already contained within the current vaccines is a type of highly absorbent gel known as hydrogel, made up of large molecules known as polymers. Hydrogel is used to carry genetic materials, Luciferase enzymes, and other components making up the vaccines. Some of these hydrogel components are referred to as nanobots, which are molecular composites that can be programmed to carry out a specific task. The nucleic acids of DNA naturally self-assemble and this ability is used to design, and through genetic modification, program them. Nanobots are used to carry drugs and molecular payloads to specific targets within the body. Other nanobots function as biological sensors, collecting information from within the body and are capable of transmitting this digital information outside of the body. Lastly on the nanoscale, which is measured in billionths of a meter, are quantum dots, also referred to as artificial atoms. These are actual semiconductors with both optical and electronic properties. Similar to Luciferase, quantum dots also emit visible light. These have also been referred to as quantum dot tattoos.</p>
<p><a href="https://preview.redd.it/7syubah24jf71.png?width=3367&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8515500480dc8ef5bfcdffcea55b4f741774b2d">The Starlink satellite array is covering the entire Earth.</a></p>
<p>All of the aforementioned materials are contained within the present day, or soon to be swiftly implemented in the next vaccines. Some, like the quantum dots, have yet to be activated will be by their receiving an electromagnetic signal transmitted through the current 5th Generation wireless systems in tandem with the imminent worldwide Starlink satellite array. <strong>Soon, the hypodermic needle and syringe used to inject vaccines will be replaced by a microneedle array patch, much like an adhesive bandage</strong>. In this way, the vaccines will not require refrigeration, and can be applied by most anyone to themselves. In fact, they can be shipped, mailed and delivered to nearly everyone. As the name implies, the patch contains a group of small needles that when pushed against the skin feel similar to Velcro, with little to no pain. These needles then dissolve leaving only their tips embedded beneath the surface, delivering their cargo to be absorbed into and distributed through the bloodstream to every cell in the body.</p>
<p>When taken together at the final phase of this global campaign, the quantum dots and Luciferase manifest as a tattoo just beneath the surface of the skin after being applied with the imminent microneedle array patch. <strong>As such, a device will be required to see these and detect the presence of this biometric mark anywhere on the body, namely the right arm or hand</strong>. Smartphones equipped with technology to detect these materials already exist. When described in Revelation 13:6, the mark is received in the right hand or forehead, and this can be interpreted as locations of convenience for scanning and detecting the presence of the mark. This will be similar in fashion to the present use of a digital thermometer applied to the forehead in checking for an elevated body temperature.</p>
