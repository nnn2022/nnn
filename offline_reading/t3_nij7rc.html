    <strong>Discrimination based on religion is illegal</strong>
    <p><p>I had an interesting thought pop into my head this morning.  </p>
<p>In Canada and in many other parts of the world, those of us who choose not to partake in this insane mass vaccination experiment are looking at restrictions, discrimination and segregation for our future.</p>
<p>Disappointingly, it is mainly those who call themselves "liberals" who are leading the charge towards this discrimination and segregation.</p>
<p>These were the same people who last year kicked up a storm about proposed Bill 21, which forbids religious symbols from being shown in public office.  </p>
<p>These people are against discrimination based on religion, but would have absolutely no qualms discriminating against you for not getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>So here's a thought: <strong>Why don't we start and incorporate a new religion?</strong></p>
<p>If we make it into law, it will become illegal to discriminate against people of this religion.  I believe it only takes a few thousand signatures to incorporate a religion in Canada.  </p>
<p>It would be the equivalent of creating a medical exemption for wearing those stupid masks.  But they wouldn't be able to discriminate against it, because it would be protected under our Charter Rights.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sold on this idea.  But it might work.  It certainly is a good debate point with people, who quickly recognize discrimination based on religion is both illegal and immoral.  </p>
<p>It stops them in their tracks when they talk about discriminating based on vaccination status.</p></p>

        <p>well I'm not sure, but that's what I'm getting at.. if an existing one doesn't help, why would a new one change anything? I guess I'd look into it before I dumped a ton of effort and/or cash into something new..</p>

        <p>Here’s a list of more examples of religious exemptions, and their reasons:</p>
<p>“Hinduism: Hinduism says that divinity permeates all things, including plants and animals, and places special emphasis on the sanctity of the bovine (cow) species. There may be concerns with the use of cows in the creation of the vaccine. Additionally, Hindus, in general, are opposed to abortion. Measles vaccines are typically combined with the rubella vaccine, which was initially derived from cell lines obtained from aborted fetal tissue.</p>
<p>Roman Catholicism: Involvement with vaccines initially derived from aborted fetal tissue carries differing moral weight for consumers, marketers, and vaccine producers. For some Roman Catholics, the use of vaccines developed using cell lines from aborted fetal tissue constitutes a ‘‘passive cooperation’’ with moral wrongdoing. As such, Catholics have an ethical obligation to promote development of an alternative live rubella vaccine and the support of the Church to make conscientious objections to vaccines with which there are moral problems. Catholics are encouraged to support development of vaccines derived from non-aborted tissue sources. As a way to reduce tension between religious conviction and public health, the Church advises Catholics to obtain the MMR vaccine for their children because of the protective effects of the vaccine but they are obligated to lobby for development of a morally acceptable alternative.</p>
<p>Protestantism: Like Roman Catholics, Protestant Christians do not tend to have objections to the use of the rubella vaccine except for possible concerns with components of the vaccine originating from aborted fetal tissue. Specific Protestant denominations may have additional unique concerns. For instance, Christian Scientists believe disease is not caused by a biological pathogen, but rather spiritual distancing from God, and so diseases should be treated with prayer. As such, they may have a fundamental issue with vaccines in general, including but not specific to the measles vaccine. In addition, Dutch reformed congregations believe vaccines prevent an individual from fully relying on God for their health. Again, this may lead to a general, but not specific refusal of vaccines due to religious reasons.</p>
<p>Islam: Both theological and social issues may be present for Muslims regarding certain vaccines, primarily those derived using porcine (pig family) elements. Theological issues may include use of porcine components, while social issues may include concerns for safety. The Qur’an and Islamic tradition indicate certain animal products are absolutely forbid- den. In 1995, the Islamic Organization for the Medical Sciences issued a statement saying that it was permissible to ingest products derived using porcine elements because the transformation purified them. Despite this, there remains controversy, and beliefs about vaccines vary among Islamic individuals.</p>
<p>Jehovah’s Witnesses: The Jehovah’s Witness faith has a strong prohibition against transfusions of whole blood and the use of certain blood components to develop medicines or treat disease. By abstaining from blood, Witnesses express their faith that, “only the shed blood of Jesus can redeem them and save their life” (Wombwell et al. 2015, p. 601). Up until 1952, Jehovah’s Witnesses were instructed not to receive vaccinations, as one of the leaders of the religion believed vaccination caused animal blood cells to be injected into humans. However, as technology advanced it become clear that was not the case. Since 1952, the official position of the Witnesses is neutrality, essentially leaving it up to individuals to decide wether or not to.</p>
<p>Amish: In recent years, Amish communities throughout the US have experienced outbreaks of disease due to a lack of vaccination and community immunity. Immunizations are not prohibited by Amish communities, however there are large segments of the Amish population that do not receive immunizations due to poor access to health care and concerns about vaccine safety.</p>
<p>Judaism: Judaic beliefs stand firmly on the idea that all must be done to preserve health, and the human body. For that reason, when a mea- sles outbreak occurred in Antwerp, Belgium among an Orthodox community, those in- terviewed by authorities said the refusal of vaccination was not due to religious beliefs, instead due to fears of side effects or allergies to the vaccination itself.”</p>
