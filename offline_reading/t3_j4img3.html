    <strong>Willingness to take part in research</strong>
    <p><p>I have a question on your thoughts of some research I’m planning. I’m considering doing research into social media and opinions on coronavirus, specifically focusing on opinions that go against the mainstream consensus on matters related to Covid-19. What I want to look at is whether or not opinions and responses to coronavirus are affected if social media isn’t used, and information is consumed strictly from ”traditional” news media for two weeks. </p>
<p>What this would consist of for the participants is giving up social media (including Reddit) for two weeks, and two questionnaires and an interview, which could be via Zoom or Skype (or phone or email, however you like). I know giving up social media for two weeks is quite a lot to ask, really I’m just hoping there’s a few of you out there who find the question interesting, or who just want to self explore or solidify their views. If the experiment has no effect on your opinions or responses to coronavirus, how often you think about it, your mood etc, then that’s absolutely fine, I’ll still have tested a hypothesis.</p>
<p>I would not be judging or moralizing or trying to convince you of anything, just want to ask how it’s affected you. I’d probably want to discuss some things like distrust in government and traditional media on a wider level as well. It would be fully anonymous as well. I’m not asking anyone to sign up for anything, I’m just wondering if there’s anyone out there who would actually be willing to participate, or if this would be really far fetched? Do you guys know any websites, forums etc where I could find people who’d be willing to participate? Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated. Thanks!</p></p>

        <p>I’m absolutely not trying to stop the spread of legitimate information and communication. If I was, I’d definitely use a more effective method than asking people to voluntarily give up Reddit and Facebook for fourteen days and telling me how it affected their thought process. I said ”traditional” news, not real news. Think we can both agree that a newspaper, radio and televised news is more of a traditional news source than social media.</p>

        <p>As of now, I’m keeping the university private. No vetting of the plan or questionnaire as of yet, as I’m merely trying to sus out whether there would be any possibility of having participants to this. It’s not set in stone that I’ll even do this, since the reception seems quite negative. It’s merely a postgraduate research paper, no external funding etc.</p>

        <p>As someone who has a PhD in the social sciences and spent a lot of time trying to get strangers to talk to me, I'd suggest running your idea past your advisor first instead of trying to get participants now. As a researcher of people, you have to come across as unbiased and transparent, otherwise people won't talk to you (and hence all the push back). Your advisor can hopefully help you with that.</p>

        <p>I have run the idea past my advisor. I am not trying to get participants now as stated in the post, I just posted to get some input, and to see if there is any interest to actually participate in this before I pursue this further. I do appreciate your advice, but I’d also like to know what about my question seemed biased and not transparent to you? Thanks very much!</p>

        <p>You'd probably get more traction if you said something like, "Hi, my name is x, I'm a postgraduate student at the University of x and I'd like to conduct research on xyz". If you're not transparent about who you are as a researcher, it just send red flags. As for being biased, I'm not sure how much time you've spent in this sub, but we were recently brigaded and are constantly trolled. A lot of us have also heard of Facebook paying people to log off for a few weeks, which has been interpreted as censorship. So, your audience is already suspicious of research like yours and we assume you're a troll. Building trust is an essential part of researching people and I'm just saying that your post, given the circumstances, didn't achieve that.</p>

        <p>That’s fair enough. As I am still only at a stage where I am seeking input and comments from people in this community, I did not yet see it as necessary to identify myself, as I was not asserting myself as someone who is conducting research into this. Rather, I was asking whether there would be any interest in taking part if I would undertake a (somewhat brief) research into this, and what the community would think about this, and whether they’d have any input into what the research would look like. I was unaware of the trolling and brigading you’ve experienced. I wasn’t trying to build trust per se, merely just inquiring if the community would be willing to provide any information on whether this research would be something you’d be willing to collaborate with. Thanks still for your input, if this is something that I will undertake I will take this into consideration!</p>
