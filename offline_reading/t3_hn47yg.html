<p>By the way, James posts on Bitchute, an alternative platform that isn't a cesspit of censorship. He gets heavily censored/shadowbanned on YouTube.</p>
<p>You can find him on Bitchute <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/channel/corbettreport/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/channel/corbettreportextras/">here</a>.</p>

        <p>moronic babble wrapped up in fancy talk</p>
<p>it's called novel corona virus.  novel means new to humans, which means humans have NO defense against the virus.  NONE.  all we can do is try to prevent the spread</p>
<p>the corona virus spreads primarily through respiratory droplets exhaled during speech, sneezing, coughing, or even breathing.  </p>
<p>now, other tricky thing about the corona virus is it takes about ten days for most people to have symptoms.  this means people are sick and spreading the disease and not know it - corbett could be infected as he recorded this video, spreading the virus around, and not show symptoms for another week</p>
<p>wearing a mask greatly reduces the respiratory droplets spread by the wearer.  </p>
<p>it's science.  actually, it's COMMON SENSE.  it's not an illuminati plot, or globalists trying to take away your freedom.</p>

        <p>The scientific method is a fantastic tool for discovering the truth about our world.  It helps us to live better, longer lives through technology and medicine.  It is responsible for the unimaginable levels of comfort,  safety and human well being that we enjoy today. </p>
<p>It is not,  however,  a religious ideology that dictates our actions and makes our decisions for us.  It is simply a method for determining truth and measuring reality.   As rational,  reasoning animals that require purposeful, value driven action in order to survive,  our decisions as individuals on how best to live our lives have always been,  and will always be ours to make.</p>

        <p>Nice straw man Mr """"logic""""</p>
<p>Your world view suggests that scientific discoveries are in flux and change each day according to new info. So in that you have to conclude that information  you now believe to be true will not be true in the future. Its self refuting ofcourse.</p>

        <p>&rt;Your world view suggests that scientific discoveries are in flux and change each day according to w info.</p>
<p>first, we're not talking about scientific discoveries but scientific understanding and knowledge</p>
<p>second, what we know <em>does</em> change with new information - that's at the very heart of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">scientific method</a>.  </p>
<p>third, you talk about science being true which implies it is provable, but there's no such thing as scientific proof.  what we have are theories and explanations that have been tested and work.  instead of proof there is consensus.  a lot of the science we "know" now was bitterly disputed when first proposed but gradually gained acceptance as it was tested and refined and more and better data came in - AGW climate is a good example of a theory that was disputed and now is universally accepted</p>
<p>as for the flat earth... the thing is, for a long time the theory of a flat earth worked just fine for most people.  the earth <em>was</em> flat, as far as their experience was concerned.  but then we got more information and technological advances and geometry and telescopes and the flat earth idea just didn't work</p>
<p>same thing with gravity - people thought a pound of feathers fell slower than a pound of lead, which goes to the heart of what gravity is all about.  then someone tested it (leaning tower of pisa) and oops, nope.  so then you gotta figure out why a pound of feathers might appear to fall more slowly, and get a theory about air pressure slowing down a feather etc etc</p>

        <p>we won't know the <em>scientific</em> proof of anything because 
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/11/22/scientific-proof-is-a-myth/#12b73bae2fb1">there's no such thing as scientific proof</a>.</p>
<p>science isn't like math, were 2 + 2 = 4 and that's that. </p>
<p>the natural world is complicated and we're limited in what we can observe and measure.   for example, we thought we understood sickness until the development of a microscope opened up the door to understanding bacteria and virus.  or think about gravity.  yeah, it's safe to trust that if we throw something into the air it will come down (because we've observed this and tested it and it seems to work) but we used to think heavier weights would fall faster than lighter others of the same size, until galileo actually tested that in leaning tower of pisa.  </p>
<p>climate change is a great example.  start with asking why is the earth nice and warm, and not a frozen ball of mud and ice?  well, it was about 150? 200? years ago a scientist <em>theorized</em> it was due to atmospheric gases that trapped solar heat in the atmosphere, the same way the windows of a greenhouse can trap solar heat and keep things tropical in the middle of the winter.  based on that <em>theory</em> it was logical to <em>theorize</em> that the more of these gases in the atmosphere, the more heat would be trapped.  </p>
<p>well, that made sense to a lot of scientists and in fact the theory generally worked but not always, so there were some scientists who weren't convinced of or flat out disagreed with AGW, and they had their own theories about why the earth was warming (solar flares, etc).</p>
<p>but time went on and more and better measurements were made and loose ends were explained and the other theories didn't work or weren't significant enough, and now AGW is universally accepted.  </p>
<p>and there it is.... the measure of scientific "proof" is consensus.</p>

        <p>&rt;So you don't think consensus could become corrupted along the way for a multitude of different reasons? </p>
<p>sure.  as much as anyone, including YOU</p>
<p>scientists are people too, and people potentially as corruptible.  that said, i would argue scientists are less corruptible because their work is evidence based and the scientific method invites scrutiny and demands their positions be defensible and based on evidence</p>
<p>&rt;Like how pharmaceutical companies can influence research in order to promote their products</p>
<p>sure.   like tobacco companies argued for years that smoking was harmless.  in fact, you can make a good argument that smoking IS harmless for some people, and there's always some 95 year old woman who's been smoking two packs a day for 80 years and is healthy as a horse.  </p>
<p>she's the exception, of course, but she also shows there's some holes in the well established scientific understanding that smoking is bad for people, because it doesn't seem to be bad for <em>her</em> so you can't say it is a proven fact smoking is bad for all people.  </p>
<p>nature is complicated and rarely gets down to binary, black or white, either this or that choices, and corporations can exploit that, and they've got the money to do it.  </p>
<p>the scientific consensus can be that smoking is bad for you, but corporations don't need to corrupt the entire scientific community to advance their product or point of view, they just need to find a few corruptible scientists or argumentative cranks who thrive trying to tear down others.</p>

        <p>Great! So would you agree that your current stance that
"it's not an illuminati plot, or globalists trying to take away your freedom." Could incomplete because of a lack of information?
And would you be genuinely open to consider new information that might suggest otherwise?</p>
