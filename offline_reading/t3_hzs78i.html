    <strong>When you don't wear a mask it inspires me to not wear a mask.</strong>
    <p><p>I was at a local shopping center. There was a farmers market going on next door. I wasn't wearing a mask. I started walking over.</p>
<p>As I approached I saw that everybody, EVERYBODY, was wearing a mask. This is outdoors, hot day.</p>
<p>Mask central.</p>
<p>As I approached things started getting tense. People started staring.</p>
<p>I turned around and noped off like a coward.</p>
<p>If there had been just one person there without a mask I might have gone on in.</p>
<p>So there you go.</p></p>

        <p>I wish I could have been there too.  Remember we are all thinking the same thing even though we are not in the same place.  Sometimes being the one person without a mask can inspire someone to take it off.  Don't give up.</p>

        <p>This has happened to me like 4 times now. Someone walks into the store and sees me without my mask and they take theirs off. Twice they actually said "Well if you guys aren't wearing a mask, I'm not wearing this bullshit either".</p>

        <p>Exactly.  I'm fairly certain the majority of the masked are in fact more than ready to take that shit off.  If they don't have 1 reason to do that they won't because they are really wigged out by the whole situation (understandably).  If we can be that 1 reason despite the risk of being uncomfortable it's worth it.  The truth is contagious</p>

        <p>Yeah agreed. I was never going to wear one anyways, but experiences like that remind me that besides the glaringly obvious medical facts about re-breathing your own co2, the "maskne", tonsil infections, tooth infections etc. There are other reasons not to wear a mask, to empower the individual on the fence who doesn't want to be singled out/harassed.</p>

        <p>Yeah believe it or not, many americans don't have good dental or medical care. Rebreathing your own bacteria for 8 hours in a mask is going to help bacteria in your mouth thrive and multiply faster.</p>

        <p>I've been studying dentistry as a strange hobby since kindergarten, but that doesn't address the issue of trying to work inside my own mouth while possibly under the influence of sedatives. I'll hopefully find someone eventually, but if I don't trust or respect someone on a more-or-less sexual level, I don't trust them enough to insert anything in my mouth. It is an orifice, after all.</p>

        <p>Yeah haha, I was trying to find a better way of wording that. But basically, if I don't trust someone enough to have literal sex with them, I probably won't trust them to perform a medical procedure on my numbed or sedated body. Always felt that way, ever since I was a small child. Just couldn't find the words for it until I got older. I understand how it seems strange, but I find it just as strange that most people are so comfortable exposing their bodies to anyone but a lover. To each their own though. That's part of what drives my lifelong passion for biology and medicine, a repulsion toward being touched except for by a select few.</p>
<p>Huh, interesting link....I wonder what it means for people who lack wisdom teeth? Thankfully, mine were never really an issue, which was a pleasant surprise after being raised to believe that wisdom teeth exist only to be removed. They're like the appendix of the face lol</p>
<p>Good day to you as well! :)</p>

        <p>I'm sure they must serve a purpose, humans just may not understand them yet. </p>
<p>Case in point on appendix: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/01/170109162333.htm and https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/why-do-we-have-appendix-purpose-discovered-reason-scientists-does-gut-bacteria-midwestern-university-a7524086.html</p>
<p>https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/why-do-humans-have-wisdom-teeth-that-need-to-be-removed</p>
<p>I quit eating animals when I was young, so my backteeth are the real workers in my mouth. I'll have to ask my friends/family how often they use their backteeth but I'm sure most people are not conscious of that.</p>
<p>edit: Here is quote from end of that article: "Consequently, many dental scientists recommend increasing the number of crunchy, hard foods on your kids’ plates. Some additional raw fruits, veggies and nuts could potentially prevent later wisdom teeth extractions. As anthropologist Julia Boughner put it writing for The Conversation, “While science can’t yet say for sure that it will work, it probably can’t hurt.”"</p>
<p>Forgot to mention that I still have mine as well, and looks like they are fine when I reference my recent xray to one from 20yrs ago. They used to kinda swell up for a day every 6-12months but since I had a tooth pulled they either have some leeway or they aren't moving because I haven't had that happen again since then.</p>

        <p>What we eat is definitely a major factor. The details probably vary between individuals, but it only makes sense that the organs we use for eating would be greatly affected by what we eat. Just like muscles, use them or use them. But not overuse or misuse. I probably just got lucky though, my diet growing up was fairly soft. Though I did gnaw on things I probably shouldn't until I was 17 or so.</p>

        <p>Dude, here's a bit of a revelation that might help you in the next few months...<em>we're in the middle of a fucking pandemic</em>, that's reason enough to bear the discomfort and wear a mask.</p>
<p>You talk about the risk of being socially uncomfortable, others who were masks are literally doing it to literally save their life and the life of others.</p>
<p>Ad-hominems don't really help my case, but at this point I don't really care; you are an extremely selfish person if you value your comfortability over someone's wellbeing, especially when the inconvenience is as minor as wearing a fucking mask.</p>

        <p>It's ironic, because you are doing exactly what you are claiming OP is doing: valuing your own comfort over someone else's well-being. Masks have not been proved effective at preventing viral spread (most studies show the opposite) and requiring people to wear them is security theater paradoxically designed both to invoke fear in people and to make them feel safe. So you are saying that other people need to at best inconvenience themselves and at worst inflict harm (psychological and physical) on themselves so that you can feel safe about something you have no control over.</p>

<p>If you really literally don't understand yet how vastly overestimated the virus really literally is, or how the vast majority of deaths were literally people who were literally already dying anyway, then you are literally beyond reason and I'm literally wasting my time and effort by typing this.</p>
<p>But it's okay that you're a statist authoritarian snob, your life probably does depend on Daddy Government and Mommy Megacorporation. At least I admit I'm selfish, we all are. We're human. Unless you're a bot.</p>
<p>StayTheFuckHome if you're really so scared, and stop pretending that you actually care about those millions you think will die from the rona.</p>

<p>I know it can be intimidating at first, but you should try again. I've been grocery shopping mask free. Last time I went, I was the only one without one on. NGL, I was nervous the first few times, but my confidence built up eventually. If it helps, wear headphones to set your mind at ease.</p>

        <p>I went to Big Lots and Hobby Lobby (these 2 big cheap stores if you aren't familiar) without a mask today. Everybody else was 100% mask. Stores were light-moderate populated.</p>
<p>A little tense but not a single negative word. </p>
<p>Also the people working there seemed a tad extra helpful.</p>
<p>(Also, there was this cashier. 75 years old. Mask down off her nose. I felt bad for her. Even without the mask, wtf is a 75 year old person doing working that job anyway? We have troubles far  beyond this covid bs, that's for sure)</p>

        <p>I was at Safeway recently doing a large shopping trip in the Bay Area, California. I was there for over an hour and a little tense the whole time about possibly encountering rudeness. Only one shopper said under his breath, "Wear a mask." I pretended to not hear him. The checker and bagger were a breath of fresh air. Very friendly and chatty. They made my day. This was after Safeway announced masks were required in all their stores. They've been required in my store for many months because my county and state require them, with exceptions for medical conditions.</p>

        <p>I make sure to smile and make eye contact at those around me. It has two key effects in that it feels delightfully subversive, while also hopefully inspires some other people who are wearing a mask only because they feel forced to, to take baby steps toward de-masking.</p>

        <p>Yes exactly.  I wonder how many of us do just that?  I do have to remind myself to smile and make eye contact and it feels weird.  The avoidance of eye contact by those in masks is very obvious.</p>

        <p>Haha I always avoid eye contact anyway, it's feels invasive and creepy.</p>
<p>But I'm making a greater effort to make eye contact lately, and more importantly, smile.</p>
<p>Not grinning though, I've always found that kinda creepy too lol</p>

        <p>It's weird. I don't usually do as much eye contact with stranger danger however I do more so now probably for situational awareness.  The smiling feels a little fake but I try to do it anyway.  I look almost exactly like this:</p>

        <p>Yeah, I kind of do this too. There's a weird dichotomy when I go to the store now. On the inside I'm uncomfortable and nervous, and hating the dystopian sea of masks around me...but on the outside, I'm smiling. I try to joke with the cashiers, etc. I want people to see someone still living and enjoying life without bowing to this insanity, so maybe they'll see they could try to do the same.</p>

<p>Stay strong people and make a stand wherever you can. I believe this is the most important fight there is at the moment. People don't realise they are using this to see how much pushback they get, to see how obedient everyone is. If we accept this there will be more I assure you. </p>

        <p>In southeast PA basically everywhere is enforcing masks. But once you get into central PA places seem to care a lot less. I took a trip up to potter county recently and didnt have to weak masks anywhere, including in grocery stores. It was great.</p>

        <p>I went hiking last weekend on a somewhat narrow trail. I wasn’t wearing a mask, and I noticed that there were a lot of people who put on their mask for a few seconds while passing a masked person, but didn’t put it on while passing an unmasked person. Probably because they were afraid of any random mask police. Other unmasked people also said hello to me or smiled and it really made my day. This is in a really mask compliant area of California too. </p>
<p>Guys, don’t put on a mask until you’re asked!</p>

        <p>I live in a small town in Yavapai County, AZ. I believe an order od Governer Doug Ducey's requires employees to wear masks in restaurants but in general there is no governmental mask mandate on the state or county or municipal level here.
That said, most businesses are now posting signs saying they are required. Safeway and Fry's actually used employees as "bouncers". (I feel especially bad for the scared teenage girl who had that job.) I went to Walmart (which I hate) instead and just ignore the guy with masks at the door. I saw maybe two other customers without masks but the employees inside were if anything more friendly than usual.
I've gone to Goodwill twice recently. They have a sign requiring masks. The first time I went I was almost (but not quite) the only person without a mask. The second time a lot of customers - maybe 1/3 or more - did not wear masks.
I went to Circle K in the next town over. They had a sign stating masks were mandatory but most customers didn't wear them.</p>
<p>Some places really are enforcing this (Safeway and especially Fry's seem to not care about placing teenage employees in dangerous situations) but a lot of these places are bluffing.</p>

        <p>Most stores have mask signs here but aren’t refusing anyone. Just hanging the sign to a please the Fuhrer maybe?  The employees are probably happy to see people not wearing masks because I guarantee you they don’t want to be wearing them and want this to end.  They have to wear them all day.  That sucks.  My employer says we have to wear masks if we can’t be 6 feet apart which is pretty much never, and we don’t work with the public.  But these people that have to wear them all day, that’s terrible.</p>

        <p>I’ve been wearing a mask as a necklace when I’m in the store (mandated state). I’m not brave enough to walk in completely barefaced either.</p>
<p>My last trip gave me hope because I finally started seeing a few other people wearing theirs below their nose or chin. I know it’s not the same as being fully maskless, but it was nice to see other people’s facial features!</p>

        <p>You shouldn't worry that much about stupid slaves staring if thats the only thing that happens. Anyways, this is why I don't wear my mask. Inspiring others and letting them know there are people out there that don't accept this. I know I sound edgy, but when enough people do this, new normal doesn't stand a chance. And in my country, majority (like 95%) don't wear a mask outside. Only buses (I don't wear it there either).</p>

        <p>A while back I went to a store with no mask.  This woman in a mask stops, looks at me, crinkles her eyebrows and tears the mask off.  Like “this guy isn’t wearing it so I’m not either.”   I was glad to see that.  I was just at a chain hardware store and mask compliance was about 50%.  The store didn’t care.</p>

        <p>Working in real estate we call a lot of contractors out to houses and every time they show up there's a moment where there's a pause and they see if we care about masks. When we take our masks down they get an "ah, thank god" look and take their masks off too. I notice that a lot, that little unspoken moment.</p>
<p>I've had clients laugh in my face for making a mask, usually when they're from the older generation.</p>

        <p>You list illegality as the reason why you don't do what you want to do. But you can still do it or not. Folk need to be regularly reminded that just cuz something is illegal doesn't mean it's impossible, immoral, etc..</p>

        <p>Good for you! I live in CA. We are mandated to wear masks in public spaces when we can't stay 6 feet apart. I've noticed people that I work with that walk together on their breaks started wearing masks outside. Walking in 95+ degree weather with masks on. I have asked repeatedly if masks are required outside and I've been told no, if you keep 6ft apart. I don't walk with them, but I certainly don't wear my mask outside in the heat. Everyone seems to be a sheeple because they don't want to get disciplined, which work will be quick to do.</p>

        <p>I just walked around the supermarket wearing a snood very loosely over my mouth, not covering my nose and as I walk around the supermarket it gradually fell down mostly to my chin.</p>
<p>No one gave a **** though, or if they did they weren't brave enough to say anything to my face. A few dirty looks from an old grandma blocking the whole aisle with her trolley. Gotta love that repressed British anger, never quite enough to simmer over into action.</p>
<p>Did see one other guy without a mask although looked like he was just buying one item so might have not had one on him.</p>
<p>Felt great subverting the system. The general mood that I get is that most people are only doing it because they have been told to do so by Big Brother, not because they actually want to, but are scared about being called out for not complying. Saw a few other semi-useless mask wearers as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand my neck quite appreciated the extra warmth in the supermarket. Supermarkets are cold brrrr, can see why the shelf stackers are always wearing fleeces even in summer.</p>

        <p>Aldi seem to have been enforcing it with staff stacking shelves from a week before masks were mandated in the UK. I think something must have circulated from fairly high up (i.e. wear a mask or get fired) because none of the staff seemed particularly happy about it, lots of chin masks at the start of the week, but by the end of the week they were all wearing them properly.</p>
<p>Although they don't seem to have to wear them when on the tills (behind those riduclous bank cashier/bus driver  perspex screens).</p>

        <p>Interesting....I haven't been to Aldi in a couple months now, not after they required every adult to take a cart even if you only came for a gallon of milk, so I don't know if they have such an entrance light here. Nor do I know if they're strict about masks now, but they didn't care about the statewide mandate last time I went.</p>

        <p>I am in the UK so I am guessing things are probably different here (different overally management etc). The store staff are not too strict it seems, I know most of them by name, but I think they are under a lot of pressure from head office level to keep up appearances with all the 'safety' measures.</p>

        <p>Husband and I went to Walmart a few days ago. We weren't wearing masks, aside for maybe a few seconds just to get through the door, but mask compliance is getting higher and higher in my area. I would be lying if I said I wasn't scared, and we do politely comply (at least temporarily) when someone in authority tells us to mask up. Gotta play this game carefully.</p>
<p>This time, none of the self-checkout lanes were taking cash. Not sure if it has anything to do with trying to push digital currency on people, or if they were just having trouble with the machines, but I had to go find an actual human cashier to give my dirty germy money while my husband used his mom's card to buy her popsicles from the bot. Cashier was wearing a mask. Old man behind me was wearing a mask. Supermom in front of me with $200 worth of groceries and her 2 little boys were all wearing masks. The entire time, I was hoping they wouldn't say anything.</p>
<p>They didn't. Although the youngest of Supermom's little boys seemed to be gesturing for me to pull my bandana up. I simply smiled, and the kid started toying with his own mask until his older brother discouraged him. When they were finally done with their mountain of groceries and it was my turn to pay for my 3 things, I asked the cashier if she takes cash, or was she card-only like the self-checkout machines. Yes she took cash, surprisingly. Then I asked if she knew why self-checkout wasn't. She didn't know, but the old man behind me said something about change. Not clear if he meant Definition 1 or Definition 2.</p>
<p>From there, he and I chatted about the move toward digital currency and electronic payment. How this is all about control. How every action against it counts for something. Couldn't really see through her mask, but the cashier seemed to have this look on her face, as if she wanted to say something but wouldn't or couldn't. And at some point during the brief conversation, the man pulled his mask down. I wouldn't be surprised if I had something to do with it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Gah, it kinda peeves me when someone votes or replies before I can fix typos lol</p>

        <p>Seeing as I wear them for other people and not myself, I won't wear one if noone else is. If even one person is, I will for their sake as they extended that much to me, but if <em>noone</em> else feels it necessary I owe them nothing in return.</p>

        <p>It reminds me of when I used to participate in black blocs at protests back in the 2000s.  I wouldn't typically fully suit up (all-black, mask, etc.) until I saw someone else already doing it.  I never wanted to be the only antifa in the crowd, but I would definitely be with a group of other antifa.</p>

        <p>You're not a coward for recognizing that not wearing a mask felt wrong today. Listen to that voice inside. It's not cowardice. It's evolution trying to keep you alive. </p>
<p>But if you don't want to feel like a coward, you should stop running away from conversations about your opinions when they start to feel difficult. It's hard to feel brave when you can't look at yourself straight on. </p>

        <p>Perhaps not. Although people have reasons for everything they do, whether they're aware of those reasons or not. And if someone goes out of their way to debate an issue or to attempt to persuade others, they should be prepared to explain their reasoning and to honestly consider opposing views.</p>

        <p>I mean, ok. I don't think I directed any messages at you. But since you've decided to bring your own reasons up, I'll ask this:</p>
<p>When I read that, I see you saying "because I'm selfish and only care about what I want, I am unable to tolerate minor discomfort, and I refuse to plan for the possibility that I could be wrong about something that could be very important."</p>
<p>Do you feel like you're staying something different than that? Because you say it like you're proud, but I'm not sure I would be proud of any of that.</p>

        <p>Yes, that’s exactly what I am saying. The mass hysteria and the demand that I care about every single person at the expense of my own mental health, productivity, joy, and fulfillment has led me to simply not caring about anyone else besides my direct social circle.</p>

        <p>That is too bad, but understandable. Hella appreciation for the honest and self aware response. I respect everything about that. And I hope you can start to feel better. </p>
<p>If you're struggling with your own mental health that significantly, I hope you're at least working with a therapist, though. It sounds like you're in a rough state, and it can be real helpful to have someone help guide you out of that. Seriously, no judgment, the world is shitty right now. Everyone is angry at everyone all the time and it's been one shitty crisis after another and half the country is on the brink of a civil war. We've never had to cope with this level of insane bullshit in our lifetime. Having a professional to talk to can make a big difference in remembering how to find that joy and fulfillment. It's still there to be found. Good luck. </p>
<p>(And don't forget to let your shoulders relax and to breath comfortable... That makes a big difference too 😉)</p>

        <p>Original comment: childish insults are not good enough when there's a chance you could be killing people. That's when it's time to have a conversation like an adult. </p>
<p>Edit: It's one thing to be confident enough to think you might be smarter than most of the rest of the world. I can respect that. But it's another thing to be arrogant enough to bet other people's lives on it. A smart person wouldn't do that.</p>
<p>Edit 2: yes, you "might" be killing people. That's how probability works. Nothing in the world is certain. We think in terms of risk analysis. We buy insurance to hedge against possibilities. In this case, wearing a mask is cheap insurance against the possibility that this virus is worse than you think and that masks are more helpful than you think. Sometimes people are wrong about things. And when half the country disagrees with you, it would be foolish not to take serious that possibility that you're the one making a mistake, especially when you can mitigate against that possibility so easily. </p>
<p>It feels like you're refusing to put a bottle of bear spray in your bag because you think everyone is wrong about whether bears live in that part of the woods. And your family is counting on you to keep them safe. Have you considered how you would feel about your decision not to take the spray if you end up running into a bear?</p>

        <p>If you're suffering that much from wearing a mask, you may genuinely want to consider seeing a doctor. Masks shouldn't cause that much discomfort in someone whose lungs are healthy. I'm not generally in great shape, and I don't exercise much, but wearing a mask and doesn't really change my baseline fatigue. </p>
<p>I'm sure you'll hate this, but what you're describing actually sound like long-term post covid symptoms, the kind that asymptomatic carriers have been describing.</p>
<p>IF that's what it is, there are treatments to help improve things. Genuinely, going to see a doctor about this may dramatically improve your quality of life.</p>
<p>The irony of it all is that the reason I suggest (never demand) that people wear masks is to prevent others from having to deal with the same issues you're having.</p>

        <p>I guess it wasn't clear to me what you were saying. I thought you were saying that wearing a mask makes it harder for you to breathe well and that you get winded wearing one when you're not even running. I guess I misunderstood. Sorry. </p>
<p>So I think you're saying that you generally wear a mask when you're around people but take it off sometimes when you're doing something physical. Ok. It sounds like you're tuned into the cost benefit analysis I'm talking about. I've also been taking my mask off when I walk my dog in the afternoon lately because it's a fucking hundred degrees out, and I just keep a bit more distance from people as a courtesy.  </p>
<p>Some people don't like that, and they're entitled to be worried. I am, to at least some degree, prioritizing my comfort over their safety. That doesn't mean I need to go full-assed anti mask every time someone gives me a dirty look. Frankly, I have no right to be angry at them for reacting very understandably. I am making my choice and I recognize the consequences. I certainly don't blame then as being bad people or fascists because they're angry at me for not wearing a mask. </p>
<p>I just keep living my life, understanding that I can't control other people's emotions, but also knowing that I'm generally happier if I focus on doing what's best for myself and others, to the extent I feel comfortable.</p>
<p>In any case, I'm not arguing that anything should be mandatory or not allowed. I'm just saying that in a lot of cases, it feels like people are letting pride and emotion get in the way of doing something that's not a big deal and has the potential to help everyone.</p>
<p>We should all do better to be less reactive and angry. This is group survival, not war. It's easy to forget, but unless you're somehow profiting from this shit show (whatever you think it is) we're all trying to get out of the same escape room together.</p>

        <p>I never said they should be mandatory. But I think that if you were less angry, you might realize that wearing a mask costs you very little and has the potential to make the world safer for everyone. This isn't about control, it's about properly applying a cost-benefit analysis for yourself and doing the thing that's best for everyone.</p>

        <p>You're right, I edited to correct that.</p>
<p>It's a minor cost for statistically zero benefit. I think if you were more angry you might realize that it's not really about public health but it's about control. Wear a mask when you visit the nursing home or ICU, otherwise it's a waste.</p>

        <p>Ok, here's the thing. I understand and even RESPECT that you think the benefit is statistically zero. But a lot of people disagree with you. Experts, even. Sure, there's a chance that you've outsmarted the rest of us and gave seen through the illusion. I can genuinely respect having the ability to consider that things are not what they seem and the confidence to trust your gut over agreeing with society. Those are qualities everyone should develop. </p>
<p>But I would never bet other people's lives on being right about that. Because sometimes I get it wrong. Heck, you misread my opinion in my original post just a few minutes ago. It happens sometimes. And ignoring that possibility now crosses the line into being reckless and arrogant. Especially when you even agree that the cost to you is minor.</p>
<p>You keep saying this is about control, and probably for some people it is. But fuck them. That's their problem. For the rest of us, this is about doing the best we can to take reasonable, low-cost steps to protect people around us during a pretty weird and uncertain time.</p>

        <p>I will keep saying this... I am not demanding that anyone do anything. I'm suggesting that people are not honestly thinking about the risks of their actions.</p>
<p>The car example is a good one to think about and sort of shows what I'm taking about.</p>
<p>First off, in your example, you're telling me to stop doing something that you want to keep doing. I'm not suggesting that other people should wear a mask so that I don't have to. That would be unreasonable. We're all in this together. </p>
<p>Second, not driving a car is a much bigger burden than wearing a mask, (and there are no driving experts suggesting that cars are way more dangerous than we think). However, we do all sorts of other things that are slightly inconvenient to avoid traffic accidents. We use turn signals, enforce speed limits, tail gating is frowned upon, and most people slow down in the rain. You could get where you going much faster if you just hammered the gas and rode the emergency lane to get past traffic. But fuck those people, right? Because that's selfish and dangerous behavior that harms society as a whole. Sure there PROBABLY won't be an ambulance trying to get through, but what if there is, right? </p>
<p>I probably will start wearing a mask during flu season.  It seems pragmatic. I'm sorry you had a rough flu this year. I did too. It was... Pretty bad. If masks reduce the chance of me spending a week puking on the couch this winter, I'm all for it.</p>
<p>(Also, if I'm being honest, I don't drive anymore and typically  ride my bike or take the subway instead of a cab because, you know... The environment and exercise and saving money. But whatever. This isn't a competition 😉)</p>
<p>Edit: also, it sounds like your University is implementing some pretty unreasonable policies. You might have beef with them, but don't take it out on me. Don't be fooled into thinking that any differing view is oppositional and extremist. Don't let a few assholes destroy your ability to have a nuanced conversation... THAT'S control.</p>

        <p>The main issue is your assumption that we are in agreement with you about the relative risk of the virus. The virus is not as risky as you would like us to believe. Everyone here calculates their risks every day when they choose to leave the house. People here have decided that this one is not a great risk. So don’t just begin your argument with the assumption that we are on the same page in that regard.</p>
<p>Because something is “not a burden” is by no means a reason to go ahead and do it. The suggestion that you stop driving is a wild one and is an example of how “doomers” develop solutions for their virus - “People die in accidents so let us stop driving altogether”. </p>
<p>Now, your comparison of a mask to a traffic regulation: There are any number of regulations one could come up with to deal with traffic. If one ridiculous suggestion were proposed - to hold a magnifying glass in front of your face while driving- should we quietly comply? ...This would be ridiculous. Sure, perhaps we could see road signs sooner on and could thus avoid responding in the last instant...but then there are other ramifications with sitting and holding a magnifying glass in front of your face as you drive. As they do with masks, I’m sure most people would put the magnifying glass down while nobody is looking.</p>
<p>Another main issue here is with the loss of small freedoms. However, I see that you agree masks should not be mandatory so I won’t get into that. </p>
<p>In regards to the influenza, I’m referencing past flu seasons wherein you just didn’t care enough about the rest of us to “wear your mask” or fight to shut down the country. You didn’t bat an eye when others were suffering from the influenza. Only now do you suddenly “care” and it’s because of a fear-mongering media.</p>

        <p>Na bro, I have not assumed we agree about the risk of the virus.  I actually assume we don't agree about that.  I know you think the virus is not very risky.  I'm saying you are not planning for the fact that you're wrong sometimes, and in order to make good decisions, it's important to consider that.  That's why people buy fire insurance.  Most people's houses do not burn down, and most people are right that their house PROBABLY won't burn down, but because nobody knows FOR SURE, they buy insurance.  </p>
<p>You're refusing to buy cheap insurance (wearing a mask) to account for a potential huge risk (the risk that you're WRONG about how bad the virus is), and in this case, a lot of other people will suffer if you're wrong.</p>
<p>I hope you're right, though.  As I've said, I can appreciate the confidence to believe that you'be outsmarted most of the world and several experts in their fields, but I would never bet someone else's life on it.</p>
<p>Here is my mental calculus for whether someone should wear a mask: (1) what are the downsides to wearing a mask?  slightly uncomfortable and may not help as much as claimed; (2) what are the upsides to wearing a mask?  MIGHT save lives and prevent long list of medical complications; (3) do the upsides out weigh the downsides?  In this case, it's MAYBE saving lives vs definitely being a little uncomfortable sometimes.  That seems like a good trade off to me FOR THE MOMENT, until we know more about this virus. </p>
<p>In your car example, the magnifying glass has terrible downsides:  obscures vision more than clarifies, requires a hand off the wheel, takes focus off the act of driving itself; and the upsides (in reality) are.. non-existent; it won't help you see clearly.  So no, don't do it.  With banning driving all together, there are definite upsides:  help the environment, reduce traffic accidents, save money, a bunch of other stuff; but he downsides are huge: most areas built around people needing to use a car to survive; so... it's a personal decision. I don't drive because I don't mind biking, but a lot of people don't have that option or aren't in good enough shape. </p>
<p>Regarding past influenza seasons, I'd never even considered a mask.  It wasn't a solution that even entered my mind. If you think that makes me a bad person then... ok?  But when you treat people like that, you don't give them an opportunity to learn and grow.  You force people to either agree to being bad people or to double down on prior bad decisions. That's bad strategy. People should be allowed to realize there are better ways to act than they have been acting before.  That's how we get better at everything we do.</p>
<p>I've spent enough time on all of this now.  You can have whatever last words you want, but I hope you'll just say... nothing, and think about the way you view the world.  You seem to view it as an oppositional game of placing blame and scoring points by outflanking the other side.  How about scoring some points by making the world better?</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask is not the equivalent of taking out health insurance. What a ridiculous comparison. Masks have downsides just the same as would you holding a magnifying glass while driving. You’re the fool we both know would bring along the magnifying glass if told to do so. No questions asked.</p>
<p>I’ve had the virus so no, I’m not afraid of it. And yes, I wore masks, lived alone, and still got it. Time to move the fuck on; you’re getting this shit no matter how much you cry about it. Quit harassing people that don’t choose to live by your wishes. </p>
<p>Five years down the line, you will look back on this and realize you overreacted. Your hysteria has hindered your ability to think. </p>
<p>Frankly, I’m not sure you know what you’re arguing here. You’ve stated that you agree that masks should not be mandated, but then are bitching here at individuals that choose not to wear them. If you are terrified of an unmasked face, then it is YOUR responsibility to stay away.</p>

        <p>The reason you don't know what I'm arguing is because I'm not arguing anything. You, and everyone else in this thread, have been messaging me to tell me your opinions. I'm not harassing anyone. I didn't seek you out. I don't know anything about you. </p>
<p>All I've done is tell you why I think your reasoning is unpersuasive to me, trying to kindly point out where I think you're overlooking something important. </p>
<p>That's not harassment. That's a discussion about the best way to handle a difficult situation. It's something we should all be doing constantly without taking personal offense. Testing our own opinions honestly and letting them become more nuanced over time.</p>
<p>The problem here isn't masks vs no masks. The problem is you're taking it personal when I don't agree with the opinion you're currently holding. Sorry, not sorry. Learn from the dissonance or don't. That's not my problem.  Frankly, I've benefited quite a bit from these conversations. I've clarified a lot about my own reasoning about these issues for myself. I hope you gain some benefit too, otherwise, why bother?</p>

        <p>I myself am mandating it? How could I have the ability to mandate that you, or anyone, do anything? You're a free person. You are the owner of 100% of your actions and all the consequences that follow. You are the only person that you have to live with forever. </p>
<p>I didn't even seek you out to suggest that you do anything. You messaged me. Remember that. You decided that you wanted to tell me about your opinions. I questioned your opinions, and it seems like you're making some fundamental logical mistakes. You haven't changed my mind about that, because you haven't even shown me that you're TRYING to understand what I'm saying. You seem way more interested in winning an argument than in learning anything new... which is probably why you don't feel like you've gotten anything out of this. </p>
<p>Anyway, I can live in peace knowing we disagree, because even if I'm wrong, I've treated you with respect (and if there are times where I haven't, then I apologize) and I won't have unnecessarily hurt anyone. Knowing that makes it easy to be wrong without feeling too bad about it. Can you say the same?</p>

        <p>You don’t seem to understand that “mandate” is well synonymous with “require” or “command”. Your running around policing everyone is indeed you taking the responsibility yourself to uphold this personal mandate of yours. Because <em>you</em> are mandating that we all wear masks does not mean that I, or anyone else, must follow. So indeed, I maintain full control of myself. And I do wear a mask while indoors with others despite knowing that the virus, at around 100 nm, easily passes through the material of the best masks we have to offer (N95 that filters down to 300nm). You put me off with your wild, panicked claim about masks keeping us alive. </p>
<p>I didn’t tell you an opinion. I didn’t start an argument with you. I “mandated” that you stop driving. And that was all. You could have left it at that.</p>
<p>You’ve been rather disrespectful in here claiming that individuals need medical attention if they are uncomfortable with the mask while you know they do not, suggesting that I not use a magnifying glass when driving while you know full well it was an example, advising that others here need to see therapists simply for disagreeing with you about the severity of this... and you have attempted to force your own hysteria unto others in claiming the mask is <em>keeping them alive</em> .</p>
<p>When you begin an argument, avoid making such wild claims. Avoid tossing insults and playing dumb. Your conversations here could have been more fruitful had you had a little more decency and respect.</p>

        <p>I'm not running around telling anyone anything. And I didn't begin this conversation. The only reason I'm in your living room, or wherever you are right now, is because you messaged me. You're complaining about the things I'm saying in RESPONSE to your messages. This conversation is happening as a result of your actions.</p>
<p>Notice how I can disagree with you without personally blaming you for being wrong. I've respected your right to have the opinions you have and I've tried to explain when I think you're making a mistake without attacking you personally. I've been exceptionally decent and respectful to you. If you feel insulted whenever someone thinks you're making an objective mistake, that is not my problem.  I have not been rude.  I've been direct and impersonal.</p>
<p>But you continuously make personal attacks and tell me how to behave. I mean, you're currently blaming me for the way that I'm responding to you. If you don't like the way I'm responding, your choices are to try different ways of talking to me or to stop messaging me at all.  Frankly, I don't care which.  You don't get to dictate my opinions, and you don't get to be angry when your opinions don't change my mind. If you decide to keep trying to change my mind, you're going to need to figure out better ways of doing so, which means trying to understand why your current strategy isn't working.  I'd be happy to discuss that with you, if you want, but you're going to have to stop assuming bad intentions into my words and accusing me of lying.    </p>
<p>Additionally, I'm glad you mentioned my conversations with other people.  Because they are none of your business.  If someone else feels like I said something shitty to them, then they should say so and I might apologize. I say shitty thing sometimes.  I try not to, but it happens. But you were not a part of those conversations.  You have no idea how other people received my messages. And you are CERTAINLY not entitled to any sort of apology or explanation about them.  If I've said something shitty you, then I will absolutely apologize for that.  But you have no right to police how I engage with other people.</p>
<p>I don't think I'm trying to control you at all, and you certainly haven't pointed out any specific examples of me telling you that you have to do anything. But you certainly seem to be telling me a lot about what I should or shouldn't be doing.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem isn't that people are trying to control you.  Maybe the problem is that you don't get the world to behave the way you want all the time. Sometimes things happen that you are going to find unpleasant and which you have no control over.  That doesn't mean you're being controlled, it means you've gotta work with what you get. That's life.</p>

        <p>I don't think these conversations have gone south. I'm continuing to learn from this conversation. Anytime I've been frustrated with you for not meeting my expectations, that was my fault. But I can learn from that too. </p>
<p>I recognize that you're angry, but I haven't said anything to you that I feel was out of line, and you haven't pointed out anything I've said to you that was offensive. If I did say something shitty, then I'm sorry... But right now, rereading everything, I don't see it.</p>
<p>If you're having a bad time, sorry. You should do something to change that. That's always good advice in life.</p>

        <p>Bare personal insult. Are you sure I'm the reason this conversation "went south?"</p>
<p>You refused to express your actual feelings that I rubbed you the wrong way, and then responded with personal insults and by projecting mistaken views on me when I pointed out the logical flaws I saw your arguments... Like the way you insist that I get in people's faces about wearing a mask when you're the one who keeps messaging me. If you assume the worst of everyone, it's going to seem like you live in a world with a lot of shitty people. </p>
<p>Maybe you only did all that because I rubbed you the wrong way in the first place when I was talking to someone else. But you've inherited the consequences of your actions, like it or not.</p>
<p>Notice that I'm still not telling you what to do anywhere in there. And I'm still not saying you did anything wrong. But if you're unhappy with how this conversation has gone... Consider that perspective.</p>

        <p>“Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”</p>

        <p>I never said masks should be mandatory. Franky, I don't think they should be (by the government, anyway. Business can do what they want). You're projecting some fascist idea onto me that is inaccurate.</p>
<p>What I do think is that if you were less angry and charged up about this issue, you might realize that wearing a mask costs you very little and has the potential to make the world safer for everyone. This isn't about control, it's about properly applying a cost-benefit analysis for yourself and doing the thing that's best for everyone.</p>
<p>If you want to discuss whether it's constitutional or freedom for the government to mandate masks, I'm all for it. That's an important conversation to have. But while we're having it, just to be safe, it would be nice if you, as an individual, chose to wear a mask because you recognize that in the best-case you're saving lives and in the worst case you're just a little uncomfortable for a while.</p>

        <p>The instinctive desire not to wear a mask is evolution trying to keep us alive. It's the body and mind recognizing that obscuring our features and hampering our breathing is anti-human and psychologically and physically damaging. That's why there's such a powerful push from media and authorities to mandate and normalize mask use; those in control know that by inducing extreme irrational fear they can bypass our natural human inclinations.</p>

        <p>People wear masks all the time when it's for their own pleasure or comfort, which makes me think this is not an evolutionary issue. For example people gladly wear masks skiing, on Halloween, to keep dirt out of their mouths mowing the lawn, scuba diving etc.. People also cover up their eyes with sunglasses and don't have an instinctive or evolutionary driven freak out about being unrecognizable.</p>
<p>This all just feels like an excuse to avoid dealing with whatever your real issue is with wearing a mask. I don't know what that is. But so far, all I've heard is a vague fear about being controlled. But there are very specific threats you're missing because you're distracted by your control insecurity. </p>
<p>I think you should be free to do what you want, but I think you'd be happier in life if you stopped looking for ways that other people MIGHT be trying to hurt you and started looking for ways you could help other people. Or maybe do both. But definitely the latter. </p>

        <p>People choose to wear masks in the circumstances you listed because IT MAKES SENSE. They are all wearing masks for a legitimate reason. People wearing masks for fun or because of inclement weather or to protect themselves from dust and debris is completely different from a healthy person being told to mask up to prevent viral spread. </p>
<p>Many people on this thread have told you that science does not back up the assertions you and other mask-wearing people are making. You dismiss these logical and scientific reasons and claim that those who are against wearing masks have some sort of underlying emotional reason that we are unaware of. You don't know what that reason is, but you are sure we have one. </p>
<p>You are free to wear a mask of course. That has never been an argument. It is your choice to dismiss evidence that masks cause harm, and I would never advocate taking that choice away from you. From what I gather, it makes you feel like you're a good person and protecting others. Perhaps strongly desiring this feeling is why you won't consider the logical and scientific reasons people are presenting and seek their emotional reason instead. </p>
<p>I'll go ahead and tell you what my emotional problem with masks is: I am being told to wear one when I don't want to and know I don't need to, and my refusal to do so is being met with shaming and coercion, despite the fact that I have science and human rights on my side.</p>

        <p>No one in this thread has mentioned a scientific study to me once. I think you might be the first person to have even used the word science, although you don't actually cite to any scientific evidence, you just sort of say it exists.</p>
<p>People in this thread seem unwilling to acknowledge the possibility that they might be wrong about something and don't seem to have considered the magnitude of the consequences that will happen if they are wrong. I find that to be problematic. The downside to a mask is minimal and, like you said, your main problem is "I don't want to because they told me to." Do you realize the irony of how easy that instant response of yours makes you to control? If you don't have the freedom to do the right thing because someone told you to, you're not free.</p>
<p>I'm sorry people are shaming you for not wearing a mask. I hope you don't feel like I'm doing that. I think you're making a mistake, but I don't equate that with demanding that you feel shame. I would hope that you'd reconsider your views though, given how important it could be to get this right, if you happen to be wrong, which happens sometimes.</p>
<p>I do like helping people, but what actually motivates me in these conversations is wanting to understand what can cause such a difference in behavior between people who all, at their core, just want to feel safe and happy. And I feel like the better people can calmy communicate with each other about polarized issues, keeping in mind that same common goal, better outcomes result. So I use these conversations as an opportunity to practice those skills.... Noticing my own emotional triggers and not letting them drag me away. Even that comes from some bullshit childhood trauma, but whatever, I feel like it's a fairly pure motivation that everyone should be able to agree is good.</p>

        <p>You are right, I did not link to the scientific evidence that supports a skeptical approach (at the very least) to wearing a mask. Here are some studies for you to consider:
https://universaloctopus.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/masks-not-effective-or-safe.....pdf
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2</p>
<p>Here's a link to an excellent explanation of the mask science:
https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/mask-science-clear-doubting-science-behind-wearing-mask-watch-this-video/</p>
<p>I think you may want to do some research into why people are justified in their refusals on a scientific level, since the emotional and the human rights aspects don't seem to register as significant enough for you.</p>
<p>I also disagree wholeheartedly with your characterization of my problem as being "I don't want to because they told me to." That's a gross oversimplification. My problem is "I don't want to because what you're telling me to do is unpleasant, harmful, and a way for you to get me and everyone else conditioned to do stuff that's even more unpleasant and harmful in the future." </p>
<p>The downside to wearing a mask is not minimal. Have you thought about the magnitude of the consequences if YOU are wrong? If wearing a mask is not as harmless and mildly inconvenient as you think, if these mandates are indeed a way to usher in greater restrictions on our freedoms? If a generation of children being conditioned to wear masks and fear other people and keep six feet away from others irreparably harms their psychological and social development? Seems a lot more damaging than a virus with a 99% survival rate in my opinion.</p>

        <p>Ok.  You've posted some science that agrees with you.  I've also seen a lot of science that disagrees with you.  That's my main problem--there's a TON if information out there is is conflicting and not terribly clear, and since I am not trained in any relevant field, I do not feel confident in my ability to draw one conclusion over another about which set of evidence is more accurate or reliable.  Since it COULD be true that the virus is NBD and masks are a waste but it ALSO could be true that the virus is a problem (99% mortality rate with a lot of other uncertain and long lasting symptoms) and that masks do help.  </p>
<p>So now there are two competing realities, both have credible evidence supporting them.  What is a boy to do?  </p>
<p>Well, I could simply choose to believe the thing that is more convenience:  virus is nbd and masks suck.  That has its upsides.  Then I could get on a plane and go on vacation, avoid taking any precautions, and live life like I'm an invisible protagonist in a Disney movie.  </p>
<p>OR I can take into account the POSSIBILITY that the really shitty thing is true.  It is POSSIBLE that the evidence about the virus being nbd and masks sucking could be wrong. There are, after all, a lot of very smart experts in the field saying that we don't know what kind of long term impact  this virus will have (brain damage, lung damage, blood clotting) in addition to the people it's killing.  Since it is possible that is true, I consider how I could mitigate the damage to the world in the event it is true.  Hiding away in the basement? Too extreme and not enough evidence.  Hazmat suit: still too extreme.  Refusing to go into a store:  Eh, I'm not convinced the potential risk is worth avoiding going into a store entirely.  Putting some cloth over my face for a few hours a day?  Yeah.  That seems fine.  I have a have scarf over my face most of the day during winter anyway and there are countless professions where people wear masks throughout the day and are fine.  And it's really just not that uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope your conclusions about the science are correct.  I can appreciate being so confident as to think you have half the world outsmarted, but I would never bet someone else's life on it.</p>

        <p>You need to give yourself more credit. You are definitely capable of understanding whether or not someone has an ulterior motive or contradicts themselves or is lying about reality. You don’t need a science background to decide that a doctor or an establishment or a politician is full of shit. I really recommend you listen to the podcast or view the video of the mask science take down. It’s lengthy but informative and addresses the conflicting information you’ve been seeing. Once you have a bit of background in what he’s talking about, if you choose, you can examine the sources he lists yourself. It’s difficult researching something you have only a basic understanding of, but in this case it is definitely worth it. Here’s another document that’s helpful and informative:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.covid19refusers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Science-showing-the-fallacy-and-inaccuracies-of-public-health-mandates-to-wear-face-masks.pdf">https://www.covid19refusers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Science-showing-the-fallacy-and-inaccuracies-of-public-health-mandates-to-wear-face-masks.pdf</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Both theories do not have an equal weight of supporting evidence. The science that masks are ineffective has decades behind it, while the opposing view has only very recent studies. You might think that these recent studies simply reflect updated knowledge, but that doesn’t explain the other recent studies that support the older studies. Most of these recent studies’ conclusions supporting masks are based on projections and estimates, not real life situations, so they are guesses at best. The language is another tell: recent studies that support masks use words like “likely” and “suggest” and “possible.” Studies that don’t support mask use don’t use such terms.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here’s the other thing: they haven’t isolated a sample of the virus. They have nothing to point to and say “that right there is coronavirus.” The test they use to confirm infection is a PCR test, which was never meant to be used as a diagnostic tool; it is for research purposes only. The guy who invented it, Kary Mullis, specifically said it was not for diagnosis. <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/">https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Look, possible is not the same thing as probable. Lots of things are possible; you might die of an aneurism or get hit by a meteorite or sprain your ankle or fall in love. You’ll go crazy trying to live your life according to every possibility. These experts that are saying they don’t know what long-term damage might result DON’T KNOW. They are speculating and, frankly, fear-mongering. I can’t convince you not to live your life in fear of a dim possibility. All I can do is point you to the sources that tell you that this is overblown and that people are overreacting, the sources that base their conclusions on probability, not possibility.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You’ve got a lot of assumptions going right now that you may want to question: that masks do not cause harm, that experts never lie, that the people creating policies regarding the virus have your best interests and health in mind when they make their mandates.</p>

        <p>Yes, and you explained to my why you believe what you believe. I understand.  </p>
<p>What I still don't understand is your unflinching level of certainty in your conclusions. I am very aware that the virus could end up being nbd. But I see very little downside to putting on a mask when I go to the store in case it's not.</p>
<p>In poker, the people who are willing to bet all of their money everytime they think someone else is bluffing go broke fast. Because they only have to be wrong once. The people who win in the long-term are the ones who are prudent and know how to protect their chips when there is more uncertainty involved. I've watched a lot of people go broke with your attitude.</p>
<p>I absolutely hope we don't go broke here. At the core of my motivation, as I've said, is a desire that people find happiness. I don't have any desire to feel vindicated that trumps that. The risk analysis right now is the same regardless of the outcome. Calling a risky bluff is a bad move even if it works out sometimes.</p>

        <p>How can you say you understand why I believe what I believe when you won't look at the information that led me to my conclusions? You obviously haven't had enough time to do this. I promise you, that video is not above your head. The studies may be confusing, but I also linked to resources that explain the methods behind the studies. You keep saying you see no downsides to wearing a mask, well, that is because you won't look at my sources. 
People who are successful at playing poker don't have blind faith in their hand; they study their opponents, they know their tells, they know the odds of the deck. They use all the information available to them to make a decision. Why are you hampering yourself like this by refusing to examine and consider the information I've linked to for you?</p>

Sure you know all about the doctored numbers and how they are misusing a research tool for clinical diagnosis and the misleading conclusions and the lack of a purified virus and the studies that show cloth masks increase risk instead of decreasing it. I think that you weren't expecting someone to actually have science to back up their view, and now your own emotional argument isn't holding the same weight since you can't tell me to examine my feelings for the true root of my resistance.</p>

        <p>Eh, I've said from the beginning that your view could be valid. I've never told you that you should believe otherwise. That was never what I was focused on. I've been trying to discuss something more fundamental to the way you make decisions and consider risk, but you haven't really been able to engage with me on that point.</p>
<p>You don't seem to understand the fundamental idea that there are things that we don't know that we don't know. Or at least, you don't embody that idea in how you consider risk.</p>
<p>It's a hard thing to talk about over text though. So, whatever. As I've said before, good luck out there. I hope this all blows over smoothly as you predict. The last word is yours.</p>

        <p>Wow. You refuse to respond to the reasons I presented as to why I have made my decisions and how I've calculated risk, but I'm the one who's unable to engage? You misinterpret and misrepresent my position repeatedly, you dismiss my sources without even examining them, you downplay my concerns, and you refuse to examine your own biases while informing me left and right about what you consider to be mine. 
I never predicted this would blow over smoothly; that's what you seem to think will happen if everyone just assesses risk correctly, acknowledges their stupidity, and thus wears a mask.</p>

        <p>I've told you many times that I understand your conclusions about the science. And I'm willing to assume that you're correct. That last sentence is important. I've said it a lot, but I'll say it again. Even if you're correct about the science, I think you're making a mistake in your actions. I've tried to explain that a few times, but for some reason, you keep going back to arguing about whether you're right on the science. </p>
<p>And frankly, your inability to understand my point after all this time, and your lack of awareness that you don't understand my point, makes some question your ability to understand the science. Similar to you how were wrong when you said that many people in this thread had explained their scientific reasons to me when that simply was untrue. </p>
<p>Here is my point: You are human and capable of making mistakes about things. I don't think you've considered the consequences of your actions if you're wrong about science.</p>
<p>That's not the same as challenging your conclusions about the science. That's a subtle but important difference. You can be very confident in your conclusions while also recognizing that you may be wrong, and accounting for that possibility.</p>
<p>I don't care what people do, but I think they should be thoughtful about it. I haven't seen a lot of thoughtfulness in this sub, from people whose opening remarks to me were "eat shit you fascist freedom hating asshole." </p>
<p>Also, by the way, I didn't seek you out. I didn't message you to try to change your mind. You found ME and decided you wanted to engage in this conversation. You're the one who seems insistent that I need to agree that you're doing the right thing. Sorry. I don't. Feel free to go about your day knowing that. </p>
<p>I can live in peace knowing you disagree with me, because if I'm wrong, I haven't hurt anyone. Can you say the same?</p>

        <p>Many people have more-or-less given up on arguing science wih people like you because you base your decisions more on your "all in this together" philosophy.</p>

        <p>Most people don't ski. Halloween masks, while often fun, are notoriously uncomfortable. Never in my life or any media whatsoever have I seen anyone wear a mask while mowing the lawn. Most people don't skuba dive</p>
<p>Out if curiosity, what is your average yearly income?</p>
