    <strong>Just a thought</strong>
    <p><p>I am not a Trump fan, although I was a fan of his desire to take an optimistic approach to this situation. 
I feel like that’s a much better way of going about it than constantly blaming the public for not doing enough and pitting everyone against each other. </p>
<p>But I just had this thought: if he had been the one to introduce to the public mask mandates and lockdowns first, do you think this story would have played out differently? </p>
<p>I tend to think peoples’ distain for him would have made everyone (media, highly visible governors, etc.) be AGAINST the mandates and lockdowns on the name of “civil liberties” rather than the mocking “muh freedum”. 
I don’t think there is any world in which those people would concede that he has the right idea at any point ever. It’s just constantly Opposite Day. </p>
<p>What do you think? Not that it makes any difference now, but it’s an interesting (and depressing) thought experiment.</p></p>

        <p>That’s an interesting take. I certainly do believe that, whatever trump says, the media will go the opposite way.</p>

        <p>As you get older you'll learn that this isn't about Trump at all. Romney would have had the same treatment, and did have it for the breif period of time he was the nominee. Same for McCain. George W Busgh got 8 years full of it. Even Bob Dole was called "Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, islamophobic - you name it!" Bush Sr. for sure. So did Reagan... and that is all I personally witnessed but history books seem to indicate it kept happening earlier than Reagan too.</p>
<p>This isn't about Trump.</p>

        <p>I did, but my first time voting would have been 2004. And I ran in an artsy kind of crowd that was super anti-"The Man".  Also, most of my friends growing up and now are very intellectual-types (or at least pose as those types), and for a long time I never felt that I was as smart or well-read as my friends (probably somewhat the result of being a poor kid testing into a fancy private school for a scholarship), so I was always pretty quiet.  </p>
<p>So while I've always had my own opinions, its only been in the last 4 or 5 years that I've started to really accept my own opinions as valid, rather than just not participating in conversations because I felt like I didn't know as much as my friends. Does that make sense? Didn't mean to turn this into a therapy session. Haha.</p>

        <p>Yah, you’re probably right. 
I just can’t imagine someone like Anderson Cooper saying, “Look, that fat flailing turtle is a dumbass, but this is the time we need to listen to him and take what he is saying seriously.” I imagine it more like, “Donald Trump is showing again that he is a racist dictator hellbent on destroying the very fiber of this country by separating us and keeping you silent.” 
But you’re right about the hysteria, it’s powerful.</p>

        <p>They’d criticize the way he wears a mask or something. It doesn’t seem to matter much. People have been trying to normalize masks in the US for decades. There are enough opportunists that I think it doesn’t really matter what the President says.</p>

        <p>Re: Normalizing masks, really? That’s not a sarcastic “really?”, I’m not being contradictory or questioning what you’re saying, I’ve just never heard about that before! 
But also I was never looking for that kind of information before. Who are these people and why have they been trying to do that? Like as a health thing or you know...a compliance thing?</p>
