    <strong>Virus gonna virus</strong>
    <p><p>At this point it is quite apparent that many of the countries with the most stringent measures are also the ones with the worst numbers. Ironically, Peru had the strictest lockdown and also by far the worst numbers.</p>
<p>You would think people finally realize that a virus does not care about your policy measures. We talk about rising flu and rhino virus cases in the winter although our magic measures should keep them at bay too. </p>
<p>Yet everywhere I go people still say "if only the covidiots followed the measures, we would be okay by now." And "the travel industry is dead because of the idiots". Most appallingly "the young people are responsible for this." This leads to a self fulfilling prophecy of ever stricter rules, not a realization that this rules do nothing.</p></p>

        <p>The morons you describe are indeed everywhere, and they are the dimwit victims of very effective propaganda.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, much of humanity is not very bright, and is therefore susceptible to the same forms of manipulation that have always worked on populations.</p>
<p>Credit where credit is due: The people behind the messaging are very good at their jobs. They have half the population driving around, jogging, walking their dogs alone <em>wearing masks strapped to their faces.</em></p>
<p>The brainless, servile submission is beyond belief, and would have been unimaginable just six months ago.</p>

        <p>I am not surprised at my country at all. Less than 100 years all of my countrymen rallied behind a crazy Austrian to exterminate Jews and conquer all of Europe in a bloodbath. Less than 50 years ago half of my country lived under communism and were shot when they tried to leave. In both cases your neighbour would often voluntarily turn you in just to virtue signal his obedience. Most humans are pathetic.</p>

        <p>So true! Lockdowns were meant as an emergency fix to buy more time, "flatten the curve" and keep health systems from collapsing. It worked. The curve got flat as a stamp until the excessive testing started.</p>
<p>They had six months to come up with sustainable strategies to handle this virus. Yet here we are, with the majority as clueless as ever. Sigh.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately I still think you got the narrative wrong. It is extremely likely at this point that measures do not do anything. Precisely because "virus gonna virus". It will spread no matter what, that's what it is supposed to do. If we look at the countries with the strictest measures, as mentioned above, their gompertz curves still look similar. Those European countries that did not have a spike earlier this year still have to go through it now until some immunity is reached (look at Czechia, Hungary). I guess deaths are a bit dependant on the healthcare system and maybe even some external factors (pre existing immunity, number of vulnerable population, weather, genetics, god knows what)</p>

        <p>It amazes me how many people still complain that the US is doing badly and we’re so “infected” (God I am starting to hate the words infected/infections too) that other countries don’t want us there. You bring up Europe spikes to the doomers and they still cling to the fact that they had a hard lockdown and that’s what the US needs to do. </p>
<p>It will never go away. Every time we reopen there will be at least some increase in cases. All this isolating, masking and constant “deep cleaning” and “hand hygiene” is just going to keep us from being exposed to anything and making the problem worse. You can’t hide from it forever. We need to stop acting like we can lockdown this away.</p>

        <p>I said that to someone on another subreddit. They said Peru doesn't count because they are a developing country, and New York doesn't count because they locked down too late. The only country that counts is New Zealand.</p>

<p>Looking for a country with a reasonable health system that locked down hard and had a big difference in deaths per inhabitant than Sweden, Brazil or other lax countries.....</p>

<p>Wanna cherrypick? Perhaps you can choose Uganda. Hard lockdown, 2 death per million inhabitants.  </p>
<p>Doomer narrative: Uganda is the example. 2 deaths. Sweden: 581.</p>
