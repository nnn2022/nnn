    <strong>My parents are threatening to force me to get the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m 15, and where I live in Australia you must be at least 16 to get the COVID vaccine, but apparently there is news of a vaccine being rolled out for children as young as 12. My parents asked me today if I wanted to get the vaccine, and I replied with a gentle “Hell no.” I’d feather be bitten by a snake then get this vaccine, at least I’d actually know what would happen to me. They persisted, saying that the government would keep locking us down (we are currently in the middle of a <em>6th</em> ‘snap’ lockdown) and that we had to get to at least 80% vaccination rate or else. My dad said that there was no other choice, and even dared to call me an antivaxxer. I’m not taking it for several reasons, the main one being that I have a very intense phobia of injections in general. I get that most other vaccines are important and Jesse Cary, but I fail to understand why I need an unproven vaccine for an illness with. A 99+% survival rate. I refused again, citing this and they replied with something to the effect of “we will make you, you have no choice.” Now I’m scared, do they have the legal right to force me? Every ounce of me is objecting, and they’d have to drag me to the clinic kicking and screaming in order for me to get it. Though I never said it to them, if they forced this vaccine on me, I’d stop talking to them, move out the moment I could and cut all contact with them. I refuse to let my family violate me with my worst fear, for my own “safety”. I’m desperate, please tell me there’s something I can do, I don’t want this.</p></p>

        <p>It's beyond me why a 16yo should be getting a vaccination for a virus that has a very very low % of critical cases under 45. Very low. </p>
<p>My answer to "they will keep locking us down" - bring it.
I'm with you on the 6th lockdown in Melbourne and I can keep on doing this until the government can't lock us down anymore. They're literally taking your freedoms and dangling them in front of us saying "take the vaccine or else". Nah mate. Doesn't work like that.the vaccine isn't even approved yet.</p>

        <p>The only issue is they will keep locking us down until ultimately they’ve destroyed everything.
These lockdowns arent sustainable and will literally kill our economy.
Surely they can see that, beginning to believe they don’t care and are doing this on purpose.</p>

        <p>I'm willing to call their bluff .. because deep down I don't think they'll destroy the economy. I have have an sliver of hope. Sure I hate the lockdowns, but I'm not bending my ethics and beliefs for them just so they can give me my "freedom" back. I'll quite happily take my freedom back. 
If this turns into lockdown 10 they'll run out of fines to give. The government knows that trust is on the brink, I'm willing to test that for the sake of my kids future.</p>

        <p>Funny you mentioned fines.
They have court cases backed up for these covid fined they’ve been handing out.
They have been canceling them because apparently on a technicality they can’t actually fine you for breaking these COVID restriction laws.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I’m genuinely starting to believe that they are trying to crash the economy so people and businesses default so the elite can sweep in and buy things for really cheap so they can own all the infrastructure</p>

        <p>I dont know the laws there, unfortunately the law hadn't been much on our side through this, I think you should definitely tell them that you're 100% against it after doing your research and if they do force you to take it, you'll hate them for it and they'll lose you as a result.</p>

        <p>Yeah I can understand that and I've been much the same a lot of my life but now it boils down to someone forcing you to put something in your body that will harm you and that you absolutely do not want or consent to, if my family was to have pushed something like that on me at your age, I know I definitely would've cut ties with them there and then.</p>

        <p>To add onto this. Maybe set up an appointment with the Dr. Tell your parents you would like to discuss your concerns with the doctor. Go to the Dr's, try and make a connection with him/her, and see if he/she will help you out.. maybe even give you a vaccination card..if not this, maybe the Dr will tell your parents it's not necessary for you because you're low risk..</p>

        <p>Not sure what the law is but you can tell any doctor or nurse about to put something in your body that you do NOT consent.  I highly doubt you would be strapped down and force fed an injection but hell what do I know.</p>
<p>One conversation you can have with your parents is something like this...  "You know mom and dad, you asked me if I wanted the vaccine, and then when I answered you, you didn't like my response and said you would force me... so what was the point in even asking me... but know this... if you force me to get this I may not be able to leave now, or tomorrow, but soon I will be 18 (or whatever the legal age is there) and that is the last time you will see me.  Our relationship will be over and it will break my heart... but you are the ones who have done this.  </p>
<p>You do have some power over your parents as you can threaten them with things like this.  It is done in many other circumstances where children are forced to do things that are immoral or whatever.  I'm not saying whether you should or shouldn't get the vaccine, but this might be your only option if you don't want it.</p>

        <p>Contact a lawyer in your city.  Most give free advise.  Figure out what your rights are, if any.  If it comes down to you don't have any you might have to make some tough choices.  You won't be the first 15 yo to flee their abusive home.</p>
<p>P.S.  Your parents pulling the jedi mindtricks are complete assholes.</p>

        <p>Worse case scenario as strange as this sounds.
Happy to provide you free accommodation and living if it gets to the stage where you can’t handle it.
Local in Melbourne.
Lots of support out their for anti vaccines people getting forced out of there homes.
If you need any advice or help pm me and I can get you in touch with an agency.</p>
<p>On the other hand you can accidentally break all their devices or try educating them but for now stay strong there is support out there if you need.</p>
<p>Also if I can add.
I can get you a vaccine card if you need.
Have many of them spare because my Mrs works at a vaccine clinic here in Melbourne.
Happy for you to pick it up from my place of work or mail it to you, let me know.</p>

        <p>Print fake vaccine card, fill it out and slap a band-aid as someone already said... Also you can just say a no. If they take no as answer &amp; try to force you, threaten them you'll run away from home. But I see you're already prepared for worst case scenario, which is good! We gonna need a lot of that spur in the future, if you're fucced from vaccine you won't be able to physically fight for your freedom.</p>

        <p>I’m seeing a lot of people my age saying similar things here. It both helps me to know people are going through similar things and terrifies me. Nobody should have to go through something like this and it wears on me mentally. All I can say is be strong and try to enjoy things while they are semi-normal.</p>
