    <strong>Inconsistencies in the Opposing Narrative</strong>
    <p><p>Ok sorry if I don’t make much sense in this post but this is literally the only place where I can discuss this.</p>
<p>So basically, I look at other subreddits (that I won’t list because this sub gets enough negative attention as it is) that basically have to do with capitalism or the Powers That Be using their own wealth and power controlling the media or congress to harm poorer people.... and those subs are always filled with left-leaning people.</p>
<p>So what I don’t understand is why isn’t that same thinking applied to covid?? Those people will talk smack about Big Pharma ripping off poor people for insulin or point out the media being controlled by money... but then turn around and start calling for everybody to wear masks, be vaccinated, be hyper conscious of coronavirus???</p>
<p>It’s pretty dang obvious how corporations would be making money from us being afraid and wanting to get vaccines. Heck, Amazon alone made HOW MUCH??</p>
<p>It doesn’t make any sense to me. It’s like their thinking stops when it comes to the virus when it’s the same thing. I really want to point out to them the question of who benefited the most from the virus but I don’t want to get banned LOL. </p>
<p>I know some of y’all have hinted at this same question too but it really, really boggles my mind.</p></p>

        <p>Sunken costs fallacy.
If you were onboard the scary train and you were to change your view now, it means you must admit you made a mistake, take a moral (or maybe financial too) loss and start over.
Or you can double down hoping somehow your side will win and you won’t have moral burden.</p>
<p>Honestly, playing poker not only made me some small money but, more importantly, told me about the mindset and letting things lose. It’s based on math of course but surprisingly can be applied to many aspects of life</p>

        <p>A friend of mine explained it to me like this:</p>
<p>In his mind these people are all Opportunists.</p>
<p>But only when it comes to enriching themselves.</p>
<p>He doesnt believe they would go out of their way actively harming people.</p>
<p>Oh, and also, because its so "global" meaning so many people / companies and such taking it serious.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Its basically the same people who think that the worst an Eppstein did was having consensual sex with a 16 year old.</p>

        <p>The simple answer is it became a political issue from the beginning and that can't change now. If Trump had been pro-mask, pro-lockdown and whatnot, the left would have gone the other way. Opposition politics has infiltrated all of life, including medicine and science. It started before COVID and has just kept going. That's what I've seen, anyway.</p>

        <p>You're being sarcastic, but 1) there aren't overflowing hospitals. There isn't extra death or severe sickness going around. 2) you didn't mean to be, but you're right. Freedom <em>is</em> more important than people's need to "feel" safe.</p>

        <p>I am not being sarcastic at all.  All over the world right now there are places like India reporting overflowing hospitals, overflowing morgues, and severe sickness everywhere.</p>
<p>But I guarantee you, go to a place like this and find anyone and ask them whether freedom or safety from disease is more important and you'll get the same answer.  Freedom is what's important.  A life where you're expected to wear a mask or take a vaccine or listen to the experts is a life not worth living.</p>

        <p>It must be quite a conspiracy.  The situation in India has been reported by outlets all over the world.  And I personally know people in India and people in the US with family in India who have confirmed that the situation this last month has been extremely grim.  This thing goes a lot deeper than we thought.  We should follow the money.</p>
<p>But first, please let the people in India know that it's not true.  Then maybe they'll be more open to our idea here that what really matters is freedom.</p>
