    <strong>Why you shouldn't listen to your doctor</strong>
    <p><p>Read the following, concerning Covid vaccine side effects on menstruation: "My doctor was quick to push off my concerns by telling me she had never heard of it as a side effect".</p>
<p>See that's my problem with your personal doctors, they don't actually know what they're talking about, they just repeat whatever they've been told, and when they dare to ask questions (as a good doctor should) they lose their license. In this case it's already a confirmed common side effect, so this doctor clearly didn't know what she was talking about.</p>
<p>It's well documented that doctors are paid by pharmaceutical companies or charmed at fancy conventions to push their drugs. But these doctors don't actually know what they're saying for sure, they didn't spent years doing their own research with unlimited funding and zero outside influence, they just take things at face value.</p>
<p>Experts aren't much better because they definitely are under pressure from the government or pharmaceutical companies that influences their research. If they ask the wrong questions or come up with the wrong answers, they better be ready to have their funding pulled and their sanity questioned. On top of that, experts all believe they know the answer, yet every expert will give you a different answer. And if you dare to question them, they'll be insulted at the mere thought that they might not actually have the right answer.</p>
<p>My favorite example of the "doctor expert" is when I went to Thailand on holiday, and we checked if we needed some medication. Dengue fever sounded scary, and on Google the first site I found was a very nice interactive page, that was even in my native tongue, that basically declared the whole of Thailand a dengue death trap. So we went to see the local doctor and get her advice, and I see her consult her computer... on the exact same website! This confused me, shouldn't she be looking at more expert data than what I found myself, isn't the internet full of fake news and stuff?</p>
<p>She prescribed us some very expensive vaccine with heavy side effects. We bought it, but before taking it I decided to double check. After digging past the first results Google very enthusiastically offered (all which said to get vaccinated now), I found a scientific page with every recorded case for the last few decades. In the area's we planned to visit, this was basically zero, and had been for decades. The pharmacy was kind of enough to take back the drugs, and in all my years living in the area since I never got dengue fever.</p>
<p>Probably the first site I found was set up by a pharmaceutical company pushing their medication. The doctor didn't tell me about the site, who created it, where they got their data, consulted a second opinion... She just did what she was told without question, and when I said I'm not too crazy about getting vaccines she got annoyed, even though she had no more expertise on dengue fever medication than I did, and didn't even think to question the information she was giving me (which should be her job).</p>
<p>So please, don't listen to your doctor, most of the time they don't actually know what they're talking about, their main function is to make sure you don't overdose on the drugs they're selling you. You're paying them to help you make the right decision, but they're actually working for the people selling you stuff. It's like walking into a store and expecting unbiased expert advise from a sales person, how likely are they going to tell you you can buy something better and cheaper somewhere else?</p></p>

        <p>Not exactly a doctor, but my therapist was saying today how I can go to meetups and see my family again “when you get the vaccine”.... “when you get the vaccine” ... “when you get the vaccine”.... she repeated that phrase like 4 times in a 45 min session, it felt a little strange to me.</p>

        <p>Im a therapist,  this is NOT the job of a therapist and NONE of the therapists business if you are vaxxed or not.  You can do whatever the frack you want.  Unless you and your T are safety planning or working on anxiety there is no reason for your T to be trying to limit your activities.    Time for a new therapist.</p>

        <p>According to big pharma, any side effects would only happen immediately. Like within an hour of taking the vaccine. So they just don't think any side effect can happen weeks, months, years, or even days later. It's like going to a mechanic if you don't know anything about cars. Bad mechanic will say something really expensive is wrong with your car and you go along with it because you don't know anything and then it turns out that wasn't even what was wrong with your car. </p>
<p>The general public is at a disadvantage because we haven't gone to medical school. We don't know for sure what the truth is and have no way of knowing or deciding for ourselves because all of the actual scientists and doctors who oppose these covid-19 vaccines are being censored and removed from the internet just for even raising questions about it.</p>

        <p>A surgeon once told me I needed an extremely invasive surgery with long recovery to deal with an issue that would get worse without the surgery.  He informed of this with great confidence.  Another doctor told me to do nothing, it would get better on it's own.  I did nothing.  It got better on it's own.  That surgeon really talked like he knew what was going on.  He didn't know what was going on.</p>

        <p>I have had more or less the exact same experience. Was told by a doctor that I needed surgery and that I would not heal properly otherwise. When I got home, I looked up all the medical papers related to my specific condition--not a single one recommended surgery. Dozens of papers all saying the same thing, that conservative management is recommended. I ultimately declined the surgery (and had to reiterate my decision over and over, since they kept pushing and prodding even after my first refusal).</p>
<p>Everything healed properly, and I've never had any subsequent issues.</p>
<p>I am continually floored by the number of people who will do literally anything a doctor recommends for them without question. It's not that all doctors are bad--but all doctors are <em>human</em>. They are prone to the same biases, incentives, and errors in judgment as anybody else. There is this naive tendency to view doctors (or really anyone deemed an 'expert') as somehow detached from all these basic human qualities, as if they are the Disinterested Prophets of Science, forever dispensing the objective truth to us at all times. </p>
<p>They are not infallible. They get things wrong. And they don't always have the purest of motives. Just like everybody else.</p>

        <p>I was seeing a neurologist for migraines, when the preventative injections came out (aimovig etc) no one knew about the side effects but all of facebook and other online groups were reporting side effects, one being major hair loss,  I asked my neuro- he looked me straight in the eye 'no idk anything about that- the injection is safe- sure enough I was loosing clumps of hair, </p>
<p>I asked my dermatologist about it- Well gosh darn, the derm knows all about this because the injection is a biologic and very similar to meds they use.  Hair loss is a HUGE side effect of those.  You need an over the counter vitamin to stop the hair loss.  WTF?? are you kidding me.  Sure enough I read the actual medical research and pamphlet in the next rx,  hair loss is listed.  I call the manufacturer and report the 'non life threatening' side effect.  The nurse is very nice and seems concerned, follows up with my neuro. at my next neuro appt the dr goes 'so you called the drug co huh? reported side effects??.   Like this was my fault or something??  For an $800 list price for one monthly injection,(insurance is much more affordable) I expect you to know your stuff doc, i dont want to find out from my dermatologist YOU are lying.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I stopped the injections much to the dismay of the neuro. and it took 6-8 mos for my hair to get back to normal.  Still looking for a new neuro.</p>
<p>This is exactly why people do not trust dr's at all.  You sit there and LIE to me month after month, act like Im the crazy one, that NOTHING is wrong with the medication when in fact this is a known side effect.</p>

        <p>We are entering a time where the best doctors are going to be back alley doctors that have lost their license. They are trustworthy, tell the truth, care about their patients more than the salary. </p>
<p>Too many doctors today either know the truth and lie to you or don't know the truth and won't research it. If they keep this up, a license is not going to be seen as a qualifier to those who need care. Instead it will be seen as a sign of betrayal.</p>

        <p>Yeah I was conned into taking a lot of vaccines as a a kid thinking I was doing the right think then when I got into health and medicine more And started studying more about the health effects of vaccinations I realised how little people actually think for themselves . With good diet and sleep, and completely cutting out alcohol and sugar I haven’t been ill in years and I plan to keep it that way. I plan on never visiting my doctor again here in the UK our medical community is corrupt as fuck nothing worse than nationalised healthcare imo</p>

        <p>Every doctor is always standing in front of the morally complex dilemma, should I take the money and tell the patient what big pharma want me to tell them, or should I be honest, not getting paid and risk loosing my job, which is very likely if anything where to happen to the patient.</p>
<p>Add at least $100 000 student loan debt to that, plus loans for even being able to afford a home and a car to be able to get to work. Many doctors are slaves to the system sadly.</p>

        <p>&rt; My favorite example of the "doctor expert" is when I went to Thailand on holiday, and we checked if we needed some medication. Dengue fever sounded scary, and on Google the first site I found was a very nice interactive page, that was even in my native tongue, that basically declared the whole of Thailand a dengue death trap. So we went to see the local doctor and get her advice, and I see her consult her computer... on the exact same website! This confused me, shouldn't she be looking at more expert data than what I found myself, isn't the internet full of fake news and stuff?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;She prescribed us some very expensive vaccine with heavy side effects.</p>
<p>Did you just say that a doctor in 2021 wanted to recommend that you take a dengue fever vaccine? What universe are they from where Sanofi's Dengvaxia dengue fever vax scandal didn't happen? TERRIBLE stuff. Suffice it to say, you need a new and competent doctor!  </p>

        <p>Ha this was many years ago.</p>
<p>Yeah it's hilarious, the other day I asked a troll to give a source when he said vaccinations are a good strategy, he quoted the WHO. I laughed for 10 minutes, I guess he never heard of Dengvaxia.</p>
<p>But I doubt your average house doctor heard of it either, so really, why are we paying these people when you get more informed advice from strangers on the internet?</p>

        <p>Many times I have SUCCESSFULLY used extensive internet searching and forums to fix my medical problems because chiropractors, general practitioners, and even specialists failed to actually help me. It's frustrating. None of the issues needed prescribed meds or surgery, but had I not did my own research I probably would've ended up there.</p>

        <p>When I worked in a clinic we had free meals from pharma reps at least once a week. I used to think $1000 for 1 ounce of steroid cream was expensive until I started working with cancer meds. Those are about $20,000 for one month and many of the meds are FOR LIFE.</p>

        <p>I took accutane and instantly started getting side effects. I went back to the doctor and he told me I am stupid and just making stuff up. So out of shame, I kept taking it.</p>
<p>5 years later at 27, I have lost all my hair and my joints permanently hurt like shit. My acne didn't even clear up so I decided to go the natural route and experiment with diet. Turns out I am allergic to some foods and break out as a result. To his day, my doctor does not acknowledge this. Her solution to my hair loss is finasteride which makes you depressed and kills your manhood. Even preventing hair loss is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Big pharma likes to tell us that all this is science but it is a really bad science. No one really knows how the majority of drugs even work. When you go to a doctor they spend 5 minutes assessing you and just default to their biased, rehearsed shitty opinion. That is not science. </p>
<p>I believe in science but I am definitely skeptical about this.</p>
