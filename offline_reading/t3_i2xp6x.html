    <strong>A quote to sum up life under lockdown.</strong>
    <p><p>"The most agonizing thing in this world, I suppose, is the agony of tedium. Nothing is so painful as a consciousness void of change. Nothing is so painful as an able body deprived of movement by unseen cords. Just as to live is to move, the suppression of movement renders the living lifeless. The pain of what one’s lost is a pain worse than death." </p>

        <p>Great quote.  Another one I really like:</p>
<p>"What sort of life do we think we are protecting? There is more to life than the avoidance of death. Life is a drink with friends. Life is a crowded football match or a live concert. Life is a family celebration with children and grandchildren. Life is companionship, an arm around one’s back, laughter or tears shared at less than two metres. These things are not just optional extras. They are life itself. They are fundamental to our humanity, to our existence as social beings. Of course death is permanent, whereas joy may be temporarily suspended. But the force of that point depends on how temporary it really is.”</p>

<p>I've semi-joked before about the concept of "lockdown-adjusted life years," but the idea behind it is very serious. A month of life under the dystopian masked nightmare of a lockdown is worth less (at least to me, and I think also to most people) than a month of life lived freely. If you assume only a 5% discount value (which I personally think is ridiculously low), then a single month of lockdown in the US costs us the equivalent of 1,375,000 life years.</p>

        <p>Great comment. The 1.3 million life years figure is akin to the amount lost in the deaths so far (100,000 people with 10 years of life left on average). If you apply e.g. a 25% discount over 6 months, a plausible figure, it balloons to 206 million life years. Given these frightening numbers, it's amazing anyone in government considered a lockdown policy at all. It's not like public opinion would have eviscerated them; it isn't really harder to sell "the cure can't be worse than the disease" to the public than it would be to sell "no more normal life because it's too unsafe". Places like Sweden, Japan, and South Dakota have successfully executed this strategy, and they haven't even done worse containing the disease than places that had lockdowns anyway! I have to assume that some other, presumably much more sinister, factor is at work here other than fear of public opinion.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&rt;with 10 years of life let on average</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/hnwzgw/years_of_life_lost_estimates_cannot_always_be/fxe5a8q/">That's almost certainly high.</a> Furthermore, any estimate of life years lost to COVID should be subject to significant downward quality-of-life adjustment for those life years given that they would overwhelmingly be sickly end-of-life years.</p>
<p>&rt;I have to assume that some other, presumably much more sinister, factor is at work here other than fear of public opinion.</p>
<p>Yep. "Never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence." Unfortunately, this is <em>too</em> stupid and incompetent for that to apply. I don't see how you can avoid the conclusion that serious fuckery is afoot.</p>

        <p>Indeed. I was just assuming an average age of 80 with an average life expectancy at that age of 90 to make sure I wasn't underestimating the number; even with generous assumptions it still looks awful.</p>
<p>I agree entirely about the incompetence part; I find it hard to believe anyone could be that stupid and incompetent, and if they actually are that incompetent we should seriously question whether it's worthwhile to put these people in schools for 15 or 20 years if this is the end result. Instead of thinking about this issue more deeply like that I find too many use "never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence" to excuse terrible behavior on the part of leaders, politicians, and bureaucrats when no other excuse can be found.</p>

        <p>Great quote. It’s interesting, I’ve been reflecting lately on the last time I felt truly alive and invigorated and it hasn’t been since the lockdown started. I love to travel to big cities, go to concerts, enjoy busy bars with live music. I’m very extroverted and love dynamic situations. I’ve been recalling so many of my trips, missing when I went to Rome, for example, when the public transit was packed and attractions were packed and nobody cared how close you got to another person. I go out as much as possible within the limits of restrictions but those moments of euphoric, genuine joy have not been felt since February. I feel stagnant and uninspired.</p>

        <p>My husband and I love to travel, and we're both worried about what travel will look like in the future: masks in airports and on planes, quarantined before being allowed to enter countries (a friend wasn't allowed to leave her hotel room for 4 days upon arriving in Japan. They didn't give her a key, and left meals in front of her door.), and other security theatre. I'm afraid of a life without spontaneity. Anything aside from supermarket trips, which I make daily as a small act of protest, must be planned with the precision of D-Day.</p>

        <p>I'm happy I can talk about missing travel here without being accused of selfishness. Around two weeks after my first international trip, the US shut down for COVID. Almost nothing interesting has happened since then to make new memories. All my favorite things are cancelled.</p>
<p>Almost nightly, I'll dream about the people I left behind and wake up sad because I don't know when I'll be able to see them again. And we're just friends (for now, at least). I can't imagine how much people must be hurting who are separated from their parents, children, or partners because of all these travel bans.</p>

Zoom and video chat in general is a fucking bullshit stand in and I would rather die than have anyone tell me to just get used to that. We are fucking prisoners being disallowed by society to even think about being happy or enjoy being alive. I hope it never gets to where people are just committing suicide left and right but if it does, I wonder if these people would ever feel remorse or think about what they actually gave up with all this.</p>
