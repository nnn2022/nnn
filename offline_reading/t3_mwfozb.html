    <strong>How long did it take you to realize things were being exaggerated</strong>
    <p><p>I was legit scared for like a week back in March last year. But then my friend sent me <a href="https://swprs.org/2018/10/01/covid-19-intro/">this website</a>, and I pretty much haven't given a fuck about this virus since April last year. It took a bit longer for my brother to be convinced, but he had no clue how corrupt the U.S. media is at the time. Just curious about how long it took others, and what was the thing that caused you to change your mind.</p></p>

<p>I'm still not sure if they <em>can't</em> see the hypocrisy, or if they are just pretending it doesn't exist.  </p>
<p>It was this obvious denial of reality to me which really laid bare what really was going on here.</p>

        <p>I tried to have a rational conversation with them. I asked them if Covid can tell the difference between a BLM protest and an anti lockdown protest down the street. </p>
<p>Then MSM started describing anti lockdown protests as “super spreader events” and said that BLM protests actually <em>slowed</em> the spread. I was so done by that point</p>

        <p>The barrage of frankly absurd articles like <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/06/08/872419850/even-in-a-pandemic-who-believes-that-public-protests-are-important">this</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/health/health-care-open-letter-protests-coronavirus-trnd/index.html">this</a> really drove it home.</p>
<p>&rt;"Instead, we wanted to present a narrative that prioritizes opposition to racism as vital to the public health, including the epidemic response. We believe that the way forward is not to suppress protests in the name of public health but to respond to protesters demands in the name of public health, thereby addressing multiple public health crises."</p>
<p>What the hell does that mean?</p>
<p>These were the very same people who just a week earlier were howling about freedom protests.  <em>A week earlier!</em></p>
<p>Insanity.  Utter insanity.  I will not participate.  I do not trust anyone who does not call this hypocrisy out for exactly as it is.</p>

        <p>It’s complete insanity. It’s gaslighting on a mass scale. They want to make you doubt reality so that you ultimately become dependant on them in every way and stop thinking for yourself. 
These people will not stop until they show you a picture of a dog and force you to say it’s a cat.</p>

        <p>The hypocrisy even intensified!  I had a girl on Facebook complaining about the anti-lockdown protests one month after the George Floyd Protests.  I asked her if she could see the irony in those obviously conflicting positions.  She said, "well, I think standing up against racism is important."</p>
<p>Like, what?  </p>
<p>I feel like we're in the Ache experiment where everyone says the wrong answer, and puts pressure on you to also give the wrong answer.  Like you said.</p>

        <p>Right away. They've done this bullshit fear mongering with FAR more deadly diseases and nothing ever came of it. The second they started closing the world over something as ridiculous as a coronavirus, I knew it was all bullshit.

        <p>Two months. The videos coming out of China in January and February 20 were fucking terrifying. The early numbers out of the nursing homes in Washington state in February made it sound like the virus had a 20% mortality rate. There was legitimate cause for concern for a good while. At the time, I held open two options: "Either it's real and we're fucked, or it's fake and we're super fucked."</p>
<p>By April, it was obvious that we were super fucked.</p>

        <p>I can't remember the exact turning point, but yeah for like 2 weeks or so I was treating it seriously, then all the contradictory information, suppressing of information really changed my mind. The hydroxychloroquine thing really showed me how much they were lying. I know someone who has taken it everyday for years for an autoimmune issue and then on the news they were saying how dangerous it would be for people to take it for a week or two, saying it would blind people or damage this or that. It CAN mess with your eyes, but you get checked like every 6 months or something, not a week.....</p>
<p>And then the riots over the summer, where covid wasn't even mentioned on the news, like it was never a thing, and then seeing headlines like "How the protests might have actually SLOWED the spread". Like shut the fuck up, clearly bullshit</p>

        <p>About minus 2 months? Whilst they were frantically cleaning everything and using hand gel every five minutes (literally) I was rolling my eyes. I'm sceptical by nature and the whole thing resembled something out of a movie rather than real life. I got burnt by someone who made up wild dramatic stories so I am suspicious of wild dramatic stories.</p>

        <p>I saw this coming 15 miles away. This is a cover for the financial collapse. I knew the social distancing and masks was ALL bullshit from the beginning. How the fuck else would every convenient store and super market all the sudden have "6 feet apart stickers" and plexi glass installed over a fucking weekend ALL over the fucking country? You're telling me the government can coordinate THAT but can't send a check to every American that needs it? GTFOH.</p>

        <p>I remember the viral Chinese videos of people just coughing then dying in the street just for catching it. I thought it looked fake. Once MSM picked it up at the start of Feb and a travel ban from China kicked in I thought it was bad. </p>
<p>By April I thought it was over but not by a long shot by the media. Once they seen this as a way to get rid of Trumps economy I knew the world was in for the long haul.</p>
<p>Once that power took a hold and every tin pot governor had all this media and power  around the world I knew it wouldn't end.</p>
<p>If it was as bad as advertised then no one would leave their house. I still haven't seen all these bodies piled up in the streets and people being shut out of hospitals for being overwhelmed. Have seen plenty of choreographed tic to videos though using "precious" PPE.</p>

        <p>Like you, I was a bit ‘uncertain’ back in March. Thankfully, things didn’t take too long. I believe it was back in April or so where I started seeing videos of doctors basically calling it out for what it is - a load of horseshit - and the rest was history. </p>
<p>It’s quite crazy how far we’ve came - back when I woke up, I was able to spread my sources and perhaps wake some people up. Now, they’ve all got fact check articles for them.</p>

        <p>On the fence in March. The things China was doing under the guise of containment had me concerned and the fact that they had their crematoriums going 24/7 while expelling all foreign journalists made it hard to doubt the virus was the real deal.  At that point expected about 6 weeks of some kind of mitigation strategy while the facts got sorted out.</p>
<p>By the 2nd week of April I was no longer worried. Enough was known about the actual fatality rate to knock down the initial assumptions from 10% to between 1% and 3%. It never stopped falling. The entire world should have been relieved.</p>
<p>By May, the northern latitude's peak was confirmed to be clearly established in early April - prior to mask mandates and all of the other insanity. May was also when fomite transmission was confirmed to not be a spreading vector.  Hope-Simpson seasonality was confirmed by July when the southern US saw its seasonal wave. That information should have been widely celebrated.  </p>
<p>By July I Was getting almost all of my COVID info from statisticians and intelligence analysts.  They deal in hard numbers, not hyperbole.  By no means do I recommend getting specific medical advice from them on any kind of regular basis but they are far more qualified to comment than the talking heads on the news outlets.</p>

        <p>I saw those videos from China of people just collapsing in the middle of the streets that were spreading last year January. Since I'm from a country where mask-wearing is pretty normal b/c of air pollution, I didn't really think of wearing a mask as that big of a deal, especially with the potential for a global pandemic that's causing people to drop like flies in China.</p>
<p>Then came the BLM riots post-Floyd... and the Fauci and WHO self-contradictions... and the CDC data... and the NIH Wuhan Lab "investigation"... and now I'm black pilled to the MAX</p>

        <p>The first day the media ran with it. It just didn't pass the sniff test. That and certain parts of the internet had already been talking about it and making fairly accurate predictions for a couple weeks. I mean, some people thought it was funny to get the "OMG GO BUY TOILET PAPER NOW!" narrative that created the rush and shortage. Funny, but not funny.</p>

        <p>Summer of riots did that for me. From there it was clear that riding the COVID wave was very important for MSM and their favorite political party.</p>
