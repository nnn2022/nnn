    <strong>You Don't Need SCIENCE! (TM) To Tell You Certain Things</strong>
    <p><p>My career literally requires me to understand and apply evidence-based scientific practices every day, and so I am in no way someone who goes around eschewing good science.</p>
<p>But I don't need science to tell me everything, and far too many people in our current day and age have become caught up in the "SCIENCE ONLY!" hysteria.</p>
<p>I don't need data to tell me that jumping out a plane without a parachute is a bad idea.  I don't need a case series to tell me that if you cheat on your spouse you'll create problems in your marriage.   I don't need a meta-analysis to tell me that children who are abused are more likely to wind up having problems than children who are not.  Many things in life are just obvious to anybody with any degree of intelligence.</p>
<p>Likewise, I don't need <em>SCIENCE!</em> (TM) to tell me that closing down schools and isolating children from in-person learning and from their friends isn't going to end well.  I don't need <em>SCIENCE!</em> (TM) to tell me that people driven into poverty and desperation from lockdown are going to be more likely to turn to alcohol and drugs and crime.  I don't need <em>SCIENCE!</em> (TM) to know that getting into the habit of treating our fellow human-beings as disease-carrying plague rats is going to lead to terrible societal harm.  And I don't need <em>SCIENCE!</em> (TM) to know that forcibly closing down people's businesses (while shifting it all to mega-corporations like Amazon) isn't going to be good for individuals or for community structures.</p>
<p>So the next time someone tells you to "Follow the Science!", please tell them to go jump off a cliff.  Which should be fine for them to do, because I couldn't find any scientific papers saying that jumping off of a cliff is harmful.</p></p>

        <p>The irony is, there's plenty of SCIENCE that has found isolation for children and adults is extremely harmful, both mentally and physically. There's also plenty of science relating to behavior change and how health behaviors take hold in society. </p>
<p>But of course, THAT science doesn't matter.</p>

        <p>It really isn’t that harmful. The survival rate is 99.999% for people under 70, and for those over, by the time you take into account the unnecessary deaths from dem governors placing old people with Covid in nursing homes, and other comorbidities, it’s really low. Plus, newsflash, old people die. Why is it all of a sudden a shock that old people die? People over 70 are just as likely to die from flu or any one of a number of different viruses and diseases, but we never locked down for those. </p>
<p>That’s 200,000 plus number given to you by the media is a complete lie. The real number is closer to 15-20k. Which by the way, the average number of deaths per year due to flu is 70k. So covid doesn’t even come close to the death rate of even the flu.</p>

        <p>Policy should not be based on epidemiology alone.  There are a lot more facets to human existence than one virus.</p>
<p>Put guys like Fauci in charge, no shit they're going to just say "shut it all down".  In a vacuum, in a strictly academic setting, separating everybody until active infections reach 0 would eliminate a virus.  But this is a very one-sided approach.  That sort of intense tunnel vision for infectious diseases is great for studying and understanding them, but horrible for creating a response strategy.</p>
<p>In <em>addition</em> to medical experts, an ideal response team would also include economists, sociologists, psychologists, educators, etc.  These people would have undoubtedly raised concerns with the idea of extended lockdowns, and could have put their heads together to come up with a more balanced response plan that still mitigates the risks of the disease but does not destroy society in the process.</p>
<p>Would you hire <em>only</em> electricians to build your house?  Would you hire <em>only</em> designers to build your car?  Why would you have <em>only</em> scientists design a virus response that affects every single aspect of human life and society?</p>

<p>People refused to wear masks during the Spanish flu too. And it wasn’t mandatory. Plus, Spanish flu was more deadly than Covid. I’m not going to limit my liberty to prevent me from getting something that I have a 99.9999% chance of surviving. And it’s not my responsibility to protect others from getting sick. If they’re worried about it, they can stay home. They have no right to restrict my freedom so they can have theirs. </p>
<p>Your second link refers to the Old Testament, when we were under the Old Covenant. We’re now under the New Covenant, and thus do not require priests for confessions of sins and such. Also, immune systems and medicine weren’t then what they are now. People didn’t live nearly as long and got sick more often. Plus, isolation was only done if the person had the disease. Not to everyone regardless.</p>
<p>Do some more research before just wildly posting links.</p>

        <p>Looking at sweden for example, you can tell that the measures (facemasks, lockdown, distancing) didn't have an impact.
Facemasks are useless as earlier epidemics have learned.
The point is that the measures are worse the the illness and may even be a devise of undemocratic political change (great reset, build back better).</p>

        <p>It doesn't need to be done. We need to protect those at risk and let everyone else get on with their lives to keep the world moving! Isolation is a terrible strategy that needs to <em>not</em> be done, and there are other ways we can do this without lockdowns/mask mandates etc.</p>

        <p>That's not what I said. We need to take precautions in hospitals and care homes and places like that to protect those in need, but we are collectively putting anyone who isn't well off in more danger by ways of the restrictions. And there's more people falling under that category than the at risk category. So we take a more focused approach on protecting them. Please don't put words in my mouth, it doesn't support your argument very well.</p>

<p>Sure, and everywhere else – since (a) 'at-risk groups' are not the only ones dying, and (b) having the rest of the population getting infected makes life impossible for those groups anyway; the best thing we could do for them is protect ourselves so they can actually interact with us without getting infected too.</p>

        <p>You're one of these people you just can't reason with eh? I know not all people dying are within at risk groups but a vast majority are, so protecting them would drop deaths hugely.</p>
<p>&rt;(b) having the rest of the population getting infected makes life impossible for those groups anyway;</p>
<p>Newsflash: lockdown makes life impossible for a huge amount of the population! Are you really saying that in order to protect a small group of the population we should destroy the rest? Nope. We should focus our protection on them, if they want that.</p>
<p>Also, having the rest of the population helps build up immunity which in turn protects everyone including the vulnerable groups we shelter from the virus.</p>

<p>Correction, not having a lockdown does this. A lockdown is a minor difficulty, a change of pace that people can come out the other end of unscathed. Unlike ignoring a viral epidemic.</p>
<p>&rt; Are you really saying that in order to protect a small group of the population we should destroy the rest?</p>
<p>Yikes, what a spin. Who is being destroyed, except in the path you'd prefer?</p>
<p>In order to protect everybody – including the most vulnerable – we enact policies to protect everybody.</p>

        <p>I don't mean to be rude here, but do you come from a well off background? Lockdown most certainly does <em>not</em> allow people to come out the other side unscathed. Their businesses are destroyed, they can't get jobs and so can't support themselves financially which means they might not even make it out the other side! People also missing crucial surgeries and doctors appointments means that they could have something medically fixable go too far and end up putting their life in danger, and if they make it out the other side it is often with a very limited time left. And of course, people are most certainly not unscathed mentally. But of course, since mental health is not a hot topic nobody cares, right?</p>
<p>As for who is destroyed, it's the poor people who are plunged into poverty and can't survive, the small business owners who spent years of work building and lost everything this year, the people struggling mentally to the point of suicide, those people. The people with no voice in society, but who happen to be a lot lot lot of people. We aren't protecting everybody. We're protecting one group while we destroy a significantly larger group of the population in ways that some don't even see, but are deadly nonetheless.</p>
<p>Also, herd immunity is how pandemics end. We might have a vaccine, sure, but naturally developing herd immunity is historically how we've done it and it works. I'm not saying let the virus run wild among the vulnerable. We protect them as they may die, while those who will (pretty much certainly) not die build up immunity which helps us as a whole become more protected from the virus. Remember the fatality rate of covid is less than 1% (generally, or at least among those we'd let it spread around), so this wouldn't be wiping out masses of people.</p>
<p>Please do note that lockdowns have never been done on this scale are were never recommended as an effective approach. It is becoming obvious why, and they haven't had enough of an effect to justify the damage. Now they're actually recommended against!</p>

<p>Painfully ignorant.</p>
<p>&rt;it's the poor people who are plunged into poverty and can't survive</p>
<p>So your position is indeed that taking action against a pandemic can be hard on the poor, therefore instead of doing anything to help the poor through this time we should just ignore the pandemic.</p>
<p>Yeah, this deserves no further entertainment.</p>

        <p>Seriously?! If you fail to open your eyes and see how many people are being destroyed by lockdown, you are being ignorant and can't begin to hold up an argument. It's not just the poor, the working class are also being put through this struggle. Bearing in mind this is a massive part of the population, the restrictions are harming far more people than the virus itself. But of course, it's 'just the poor', just the peasants there to serve you. Why do they matter?</p>
