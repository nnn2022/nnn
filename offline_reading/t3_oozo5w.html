        <p>The efficacy of the vaccines is not a binary system. They don't work or not work 100% of the time. </p>
<p>People hear about breakthrough infections and it's like, wtf is the point of the vaccine if I can still get Covid. You tell them well, it's 95% effective, but everyone has a different immune system and not everyone develops a proper immunity. But when you tell people that, they get mad because it runs contrary to what we suppose about vaccines. We wiped out smallpox with vaccines, and guess what, the smallpox vaccine isn't 100% effective either. Same with measles, polio, etc.</p>
<p>The best way to think of it, is it's kind of like jumping out of an airplane with or without a parachute. Parachutes work. So we give people parachutes. They don't work 100 percent of the time though. They malfunction. People open them too late. People pass out from fear and just plummet. Maybe it opens just fine, but the wind blows you into a tree that mangles you. The chords can wrap around your neck and strangle you, that does definitely happen. </p>
<p>Parachutes work the vast majority of the time, but not always. You don't take the "but not always" and conclude that it's better to jump out of an airplane with no parachute. It's much, much safer to jump from a plane <em>with</em> the parachute, even with the knowledge that you may die anyway. Your odds are still far better with the parachute.</p>
<p>Now people may read that and say this is a bullshit analogy, because jumping from a plane is nearly certain death, where contracting Covid if you're young and otherwise healthy is nearly certain survival. But this too is flawed logic. If you get Covid, you may survive it with little impact to yourself, but spread it to others. And those others may not be young and healthy. Your mom, your grandpa, your neighbor. For some of those people, Covid is as much a death sentence as jumping from a plane.</p>
<p>So a venue that demands you show proof of a vaccine isn't a failure of understanding on their part. The venue understands that efficacy is not 100%, and Covid is still out there. The only way we can guarantee that we're being as safe as possible is to ask everyone to be vaccinated. That doesn't guarantee we'll all make it, but it is the best we can do.</p>

        <p>I'll say this for the benefit of anyone reading along.</p>
<p>I'm not here to argue. If someone makes a good faith and compelling argument, I'll be happy to engage. But bad faith arguments, half hearted or dumb arguments like ‚òù this one here, I'll ignore.</p>
<p>There's a strain of braindead twits on this sub who are unreachable by any logic or reason. They have emotional reactions to anything related to Covid, it's probably fear driven and probably about paranoid delusions. There is no argument or set of facts or proof that could ever change their minds about Covid, or the vaccine, lockdowns etc. You could send them to medical school at Harvard, then sit them in a room with the top doctors and chemical experts and biologists on earth to explain to them that the vaccine is safe for the general population. They'd still say the same exact shit, because being anti Vaccine is literally part of their identity. They believe what they believe by faith, and it's unshakable.</p>
<p>I'm not here to argue with such people. I'm here because people stumble across this sub who are maybe on the fence, and sometimes maybe they read some half baked, tinfoil hat nonsense like this post, and maybe that pushes them over the fence. I say the things I say here to engage those people. Try to get some truth and common sense even here, in the depths of tinfoil hat paranoid land.</p>

<p>The fuck does that even mean? If you're gonna criticize someone's writing style, try opening with a line that makes a modicum of sense.</p>
<p>Also bud, guess what, sometimes nuanced points take some time to make, and not everyone has the attention span of a three year old. It makes sense though. This add point you tried to make fits perfectly with the short attention span, belligerently ignorant stance you've taken.</p>

        <p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't they say you lose your natural immunity from a prior infection after a relatively short period, like six months? For the longest time they were saying they have no idea, but I feel like I read that now they're saying you lose it in 3 to 6 months</p>

<p>Well if we're going by feelings, I feel like they probably said exactly what you just did, after years of having "no idea" because that's the best way to guide weak minded folk to think their own body is an evolutionary failure and only technology can save them. </p>
<p>And tbh if that were even remotely true we would be having 3-4 flu seasons a year from people re-spreading the old strain everyone already caught. If that sounds like nonsense it's because it doesn't match reality. Maybe stop reading whatever source came up with that 6 months drivel.</p>

        <p>I mean you started your comment with "correct me if I'm wrong", so...
Also I really wasn't paying attention and failed to notice you're the same user who posted the wall of paragraphs at the top of this thread. I was only shit talking the media and 'science' for changing their story every time it suits this ridiculous vaccine agenda, not anyone personally. </p>
<p>Since you took offense it's clear you're in their corner if not directly on their payroll. Who else would write a huge fucking essay in response to a mildly serious meme, taking a lot of words to describe an analogy and then in the same breath admitting it's a bullshit comparison but it isn't really because won't someone think of the grandmas. Still bullshit man. The grandma thing was last year's talking point and it was just as stupid then. I don't need a source, those are all over this sub already.</p>
