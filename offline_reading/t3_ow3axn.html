    <strong>Silenced</strong>
    <p><p>I'm being exiled repeatedly when I even just slightly mention something that goes against their beliefs </p>
<p>I got banned from a breastfeeding group today. Because a woman said months after she got vaccinated, she caught covid anyway. And that her milk dried up. I questioned the authenticity of the vaccine and I got jumped on. They even started downvoting me when I told her "I hope you feel better soon" </p>
<p>You can say next to nothing to these people and it lights a fire up under their ass </p>
<p>I'm really tired of being made to feel like I'm unintelligent or less than</p>
<p>Being told "I'm the problem" "if my newborn catches covid, its your fault" </p>
<p>I don't understand why these people are so intolerant of differing opinions. Why is my opinion triggering you? Are you this weak, that  if someone is feeling a different way than you, it triggers you this much?</p>
<p>One lady said "wow I'm totally not getting the vaccine now, can't risk not being able to breastfeed" or something like that.. and one person came on bashing her calling her selfish, saying she's the reason the virus is still here "get the godamn vaccine"</p>
<p>It really feels like this is the biggest group of bullies I've ever seen in my life </p>
<p>And god forbid you speak a single word. You can't speak a single word. Or they will throw you out the door like you're a fking criminal </p>
<p>I'm not a criminal, I'm not a madman. I can see through mass hysteria. I'm not going to blindly trust "facts" who even makes these facts? You're going to put your life in the hands of fake facts and then shame people who won't do the same thing?</p></p>

        <p>I think a big part of this is how the media has framed this entire issue within the past few weeks: if you're vaccinated &amp; wear a mask = virtuous. If you're not = a subversive simpleton. </p>
<p>I'm vaccinated, pro-vaccine but the aggressiveness of the pro-mask crowd, coupled an equal aggressiveness to ban any opinion that deviates in the slightest from the narrative fuels this mindset. I find this disturbing for democratic discourse in general. As a free citizen, I don't want information controlled ---I'll arrive at my own conclusions.</p>

        <p>Same to you! </p>
<p>Even as a pro-vaxxer, I was actually permanently banned from the main r/ Coronavirus thread --not for denying the virus, but for citing the 99.9995% survival rate for vaccinated people with Delta, arguing that death statistic is proof that fears are being totally overblown. </p>
<p>I was shocked that a statement so banal would warrant a permanent ban, without any forewarning. That's not normal in a democratic forum. It's very disconcerting.</p>

        <p>Because these people cannot possibly fathom someone who thinks for themselves. They get all of their information from mainstream media sources. They have been indoctrinated into believing everything the government tells them. They WANT to be told what to do, how to think, because to think otherwise is too “scary”. It’s so much easier &amp; more peaceful to believe the bs than it is to think for oneself. Don’t you ever wish for a split second that you could be blissfully ignorant? That is how these people live, every single day. In blissful ignorance. It makes it easier, more peaceful. You cannot let it bother you. Just continue to plant the seeds in a positive manner &amp; hope that people wake up. It’s literally all that we can do. Stand in your own power, knowing you are educated, using common sense, &amp; making the best decisions for YOU &amp; for your family. Shine bright &amp; continue to do YOU. You are not alone! I’ve been kicked out of so many “mom” groups &amp; breastfeeding groups because I dare to plant the seeds &amp; hope that people open their eyes. It’s a very hard time for us critical thinkers, but it’s a fight worth fighting. I’m right there with you, a lot of people are. Stay strong, stay positive. This is NOT the new normal, this is passing storm.</p>

        <p>They can’t handle anyone who thinks differently, so out of sight out of mind. It’s very annoying. Most normal people would have a discussion and maybe agree to disagree. They do the equivalent of putting their fingers in their ears and shouting LALALA.  It’s asinine.</p>
<p>I’m a straight woman who is best friends with a liberal lesbian for 11 years. We don’t agree on everything but we focus on what we have in common and respect each other’s differences. That’s something most people on the left say we’re supposed to do but don’t practice what they preach.</p>

        <p>It's easy to see why it's happening.</p>
<p>Many of them have already realized what a huge mistake they made getting vaccinated. So now everyone else has to get vaccinated so they feel better about their bad decision.</p>
<p>It's just like the kids who smoked in high school. Always had to drag others in and persuade them to smoke so they felt better about their stupid decisions.</p>
<p>Whatever. Ignore them.</p>

        <p>This is the creepiest social phenomenon I've ever seen live in my lifetime. These people are legit under a very strong spell. It reminds me of people in North Korea who are loyal to Dear Leader and freak out if anyone says anything negative about him or shows some free thinking. You can't be really secure in your beliefs if you are that deseprate to shut others up. I follow a N Korean defector on YT and she said she was so traumatized by that totalitarian regime she thought the government could actually hear her thoughts. There is some serious pathology going on here with people.</p>

        <p>It’s tribalism is all.  These people have no principals other than conforming to whatever the tribe says is good at any given time.  The MSM has created this tribe.  </p>
<p>It’s an inherent flaw in human psychology that has been played out since the dawn of time. </p>
<p>I think most of us probably belong to one tribe or another that requires ideological purity.  Generally, people give a shit less as they get older however some are addicted to it.</p>

        <p>The mommy/parent subs are THE WORST; a literal example of an echo chamber. I have made the grave mistake of thinking people wanted to have a discussion/actually hear a differing opinion (especially when asked if they’re in the wrong for X situation)…</p>
<p>I actually never even heard of Reddit before getting pregnant in 2018 and having a friend tell me to join a bumper group. I really appreciated and respected the women in that group but left it in mid-2020 because it got too toxic. I got pregnant again this year and casually read through a few parenting subs… I save those for days I really want to bring myself down.</p>
<p>All that said, I’m here to chat if you ever need anything! I honestly don’t care if we have differing opinions on politics/vaccines/masks/whatever.  I’m definitely jaded ;) but can still coexist happily with others as long as they’re not bullies!</p>

        <p>Never forget that a large amount of reddit posters and twitter posters as well are either paid to shill for a specific cause or are literally A.I bots.  It sucks to have to do, but I'm always trying to determine whether the post I'm reading is coming from an actual person who actually believes what they are saying.  I have no idea what percentage of these people we see who act like this are paid or bots, but I know its not zero.</p>

Idgaf, I learned in elementary you shouldn't give into it...<br>
Seems like most people have forgotten that lesson.</p>

        <p>It sucks, but most of the time, I find I have no interest in the groups which are censor heavy.</p>
<p>Alternatively, create a second login for those subs which you want to comment on but have to be careful with what you say and where you subscribe.</p>
<p>Your post here is sure to get you auto-bans on a dozen subs, if you haven't gotten it already.</p>

        <p>I'm definitely expecting the auto bans from this post but it hasn't happened yet. Its bullshit how we have to be all cloak and dagger like when we aren't even doing anything wrong? This is oppression. For just not agreeing with what they want us to do. We are made to feel like weirdos and bad people when really they are the weird ones?</p>
