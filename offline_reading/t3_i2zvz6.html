    <strong>What percentage of people you know or have talked to are pro or anti lockdown/new normal?</strong>
    <p><p>I was thinking about this the other day and realized that there definitely seems to be a lot more of us than the media shows.</p>
<p>In my experience it seems that about 70% of those I know are anti lockdown/new normal to some degree. About 10-15% are indifferent and 15-20% are pro lockdown/new normal.</p>
<p>What about for you guys? I am curious if there really is more of us than I think, or if this is just specific to my area and experience.</p></p>

        <p>I don’t know a single person pushing lockdowns anymore. Hell, most of them are totally cool with most places opening up again. </p>
<p>But I’d say almost all are very latched onto the mask usage as a middle ground.</p>

        <p>Yeah that's so true. I found though that most of the mask people don't have to work 8+ hours in them. My hope is people will change their tune when ui runs out and they have to get a job.</p>

        <p>I know less than a handful of people that actually support a “lockdown”. I know far more who think masks work and just wish everyone would wear one but they don’t demonize socializing or mingling. I think if something like a concert in a park was held, they would attend with a mask.</p>
<p>I know someone who didn’t want to send their kids back to school, not because of the virus but because of all the restrictions on kids in school buildings. These are people who would absolutely go to Disneyland in CA right now if it was open.</p>
<p>Most everyone I know is more about applying standard flu measures to this rather than turn the world upside down. And everyone I know without question expects a return to travel, crowds, concerts, conventions, sporting events, etc. Even if they support being flu-level cautious right now, no one expects this to last.</p>
<p>It’s with the knowledge of that last bit that makes me wonder how they would keep this up after a vaccine. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t expect big events and close to normalcy after one so I can imagine it would take a vaccine to hit then restrictions to stay in place for a legitimate uprising.</p>
<p>That’s just my take.</p>

        <p>If the vaccine isn’t fully effective (a likely scenario, based on precedent), I can see the overlords spinning a new narrative about “not being able to drop our guard until a better vaccine” or some such. I obviously hope I’m wrong.</p>

        <p>They’ll try it but I think that would be an actual breaking point where far more people start to wake up and demand answers. People are being patient but I haven’t seen anyone with an expectation that we wouldn’t get our lives back. Lots of people are being patient with those thoughts allowing them to hold out. We here have a lower threshold for goal post bullshit. Some people’s threshold just hasn’t been reached but the threshold is there.</p>

        <p>Pretty similar to what I'm seeing, and when it comes to the virus it's the same thing. Most people want to just use commonsense and treat it like a flu and I think that makes sense.</p>
<p>One of my best friends just pulled her kid from school because of the requirements and that was a hard choice because her kid is autistic and is in special programs.</p>
<p>However her child won't be able to function at school with the rules so she decided she will be far better off at home doing home school. That way she wont have to deal with the fear and sensory overload constantly.</p>
<p>In general it is looking like people are becoming more angry at the restrictions than the virus the more time passes. Which is a good thing. I go on my local news page and what used to be all doomers is now people just being fed up and wanting to open up already.</p>

        <p>It's weird. People I know seem tacitly pro-lockdown, generally cautious, but are willing enough to go do normal stuff and not give a damn.</p>
<p>Plenty of people still want to have fun, and I have to believe most people aren't as ignorant about the entire history of reality as the lead-injesting madfolk online.</p>

        <p>I know many, many hard-core doomers from all over the world.</p>
<p>The only people I know who agree with me are family, and every physician I know. Old boss who is a former public servant, she is horrified. (Another old boss is major doomer but she would love this power in her hands. She did not get re-elected though.)</p>
<p>Most think if we all just wore masks and did what our overlords told us it would be over, and it's all everyone else's Fault. Perfect way to prime the public to snitch, complain, and remain complacent blaming others instead of the government. This will never be over. People who think we will return to normality once 'the virus goes away' and once evil right-wing Nazi lunatics like us are gone have another thing coming.</p>

        <p>Just asked my mom if she and my brother are still anti-mask and anti-lockdown. They started out paranoid of the virus in April, but they were over it by May; I was afraid maybe they'd turned and once again bought into the "deadly virus" hysteria. Nope. My mom says they're still against it, they only wear a mask when they absolutely have to. Unfortunately, they also think this will all be over soon, that we'll go back to pre-COVID times with no major changes. Just like 9/11.</p>
<p>My in-laws are all genuinely afraid of the virus. To be fair, many of them are at greater risk because they're obese. Even so, my mother-in-law and her older siblings are slowly but surely starting to question the narrative, though they still try to justify the mass hysteria because it's not like they can fight against it. All of them say they refuse to get tested, but I don't have a doubt in my mind that they would readily cave and rat out all their contacts to the tracers. Mother-in-law was on the phone with her youngest healthiest sister a couple days ago; made the mistake of mentioning how many supposed COVID deaths involved underlying conditions, or were recorded as dying from COVID when they only died with it. The rest of the conversation was mother-in-law repeating "forget I said it, you're right, I'm so sorry, didn't mean to upset you" every few minutes. </p>
<p>For what it's worth, that particular sister is in the navy and works at a VA hospital. So of course she sees some of the most unhealthy people ever. If a virus can kill sick wounded military vets, many of whom are elderly and/or victims of medical experiments, that must make it the literal plague. Okay then.</p>

        <p>My mom is worried about the virus, but agrees that a lockdown doesn’t work, and chooses to go to the grocery store in person.  She wears the mask to the store but gripes, as do I.
My brother is even more anti mask than I am.  I don’t know if his state has a mask mandate, but last time he visited, before our mandate, he refused to go into a fast food place that required one.</p>

        <p>I don't talk to a ton of people, but I will say that thinking of three of my relatively close friends, they are all pro-lockdown when it comes to them working, or getting unemployment rather, but they also all want to be able to do fun things when they're not working. </p>
<p>One is a junior high teacher, and she doesn't want school to start. She's happy teaching online as she did at the end of this past school year, and she insists in-person schooling is unsafe. She still went camping with me and another friend, though, and she has been hanging out with other people, going for walks everyday and helping people remodel homes--she's a nice person who has a construction contractor father, and she just likes doing remodeling tasks. She also went to a concert and got dinner with me over a month ago. No masks were required while seated during the concert and at dinner, and we didn't wear them outside either.</p>
<p>Another friend is a barista. She admits that she's the mask enforcer at her coffee shop, and she tells me that she agrees with other shops not allowing dine-in. Her parents won't let her in their home except to use the bathroom if she goes to visit them or work in the vegetable garden in their backyard. She had told me in April or May that she wouldn't be going to a gym for a while because of her concern of catching the virus, but she's serious about weighlifting. I met her in a park for a picnic lunch this past Saturday, and she's been going to the gym and has said it's continually getting busier, despite the mask mandate. She hasn't told her parents that she's going to the gym because she fears their disdain. She is finally starting to work more hours, but that has more to do with the fact that unemployment/underemployment payments are stopping for her as she's an "attached" employee.</p>
<p>My other friend works as an administrator for a plastics company. Her office had reopened but shut down again because someone might be sick. She's the least politically vocal of the three. Her son was present at the protests though, and she seemed relatively encouraging of his activism. </p>
<p>My parents are kind of similar to my friends, too. My mom has retired and she won't go to the gym or church out of, her words, fear of catching the virus, but she'll go shopping for more than just groceries and visit her friends. I think she is actually just not as much a fan of doing things that she feels she should do, like exercise and pray :) </p>
<p>My dad is still working and trying to keep his small business afloat. He seems more anti-lockdown, but he has to live with my mom. I will be visiting them this weekend since I convinced them that garage sales are safe and told them I'd help with theirs :)</p>

        <p>I heard that the board of my church is considering opening strategies for when we have church in person again. They are thinking of taking temperatures and asking questions about if you have been exposed. The people I talk to are all on high alert. I only have 1-3 friends who think like me. My immediate family all think I’m wrong. Chicago suburbs.</p>

        <p>Well, I do want that question asked, because it seems like everyone who's fearmongering and doom-saying never seems to consider that when they talk about how people "don't behave" and are "making it last longer".</p>
<p>So...what if CV is just a thing we have to live with now?  </p>
<p>I hope it makes them realize that not everyone who has it has died from it, that all the freak outliers, weird as they are, are genuine rarities and sad as their deaths might be (people keep calling them "preventable", but I'm not convinced they know that for sure), the world can't sustain another lockdown.  </p>
<p>If you want a quarantine of vulnerable individuals...be my guest.  It seems like the ADA will force reasonable accommodations, and I'm totally behind that.</p>
<p>But everyone?  We can't lock everyone away forever.   We can't make everyone follow restrictions forever.  Safety is not guaranteed.  No one can guarantee it.  The sooner people learn to accept that, we can move on from this thing.</p>

        <p>I maybe know 20% of people who are outwardly against the lockdowns. Most people act as if they are pro lockdown but then they post photos of them on vacations, visiting friends, traveling, carrying on life as normal, etc. I don't really care how much people virtue signal online about masks. Actions speak louder. I think the tide is turning and people are going to start fighting back.</p>

        <p>It’s odd, I run into a ton of people who yell at me for not wearing a mask, I get shamed on social for going out and doing things, blah blah blah. But when I meet new people and actually talk to them, they disagree with all this too (more disagree with lockdowns now than masks, I will say that). The overly loud ones dominate the social media scene, and it’s so easy to be so nasty to people from behind a keyboard, but most “normal” people I meet in person are over all this, and if they aren’t they’re very respectful of my opinions when we discuss and we actually have a good conversation.</p>
<p>I was with my parents in Denver for 5 months and this was the case. In fact I’d have friends on social posting that “everyone needs to wear a mask every time you leave the house or you’re killing grandma” yet I’d see them out and about maskless. I’d say there it was 95% pro all this on social, but 80% of people I met in person were against all this. </p>
<p>I came back to NYC this week and it’s different. I overhear people talking just out and about and they are all doom and panic and talking about how stupid everyone who disagrees is. They loudly state how happy they are they live in a state that handled this well (lmao) and love to shame anyone who feels different. I have been “wear your fucking mask”’d many times while walking on an empty sidewalk and passing people at a distance. The guys I see on dating apps out here are all “If you won’t wear your mask, we’re not going out”. I’d say here it’s opposite, at least 80% pro all this, although I haven’t spoken to many new people to get their take, people here aren’t friendly</p>

        <p>I wonder what the deal with teachers is. My mom is one for a school for kids with major behavioral problems, but the only reason she is scared to go back is because of the new rules, not the virus.</p>
<p>These kids get violent and you know with masks and whatnot it's going to be impossible to calm down situations with body language and basic communication. Plus, getting those kids to comply? No way in hell.</p>

        <p>Mum and I are vocally anti lockdown, and have been since the beginning. One sister is still pro, the other has slowly shifted her opinion from pro to anti, though she won't admit it. Dad also shifted from pro to anti. </p>
<p>Best friend is anti, but also tends to be non confrontational. Other close friends are anti, but the big friend groups I hangout with are mostly pro either mask or lockdown orders. I'll point out the data and the inconsistencies, and they just kinda nod along, and then repeat the same emotional arguments. It's even more difficult with one member of the friend group who's seen his dad and uncle catch it.</p>
