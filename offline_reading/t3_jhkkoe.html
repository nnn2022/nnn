    <strong>Corona and relationships</strong>
    <p><p>Who of us have lost a relationship because of the lockdowns or restrictions ? 
What kind of relationship was it and why was it lost? </p>
<p>And How do we proceed and heal from this loss? 
It isnâ€™t like relationships can be replaced like a pair of shoes or a car or something.</p></p>

        <p>I have one friend who ended another friendship over Zika hysteria a few years back.  She was so sick of hearing her friend freak out about Zika that she flipped out on her and never spoke to her again.  Well now she doesn't want to talk to me anymore because she is hysterical about covid and I dropped some facts on her and I even told her "didn't you stop talking to your other friend over Zika hysteria and now you're hysterical about covid."  She didn't appreciate that.  I wouldn't say the friendship is over, but it is severely strained.</p>

        <p>My entire group of friends, they are so brainwashed they wear masks in cars. I don't go out of my way to talk to them or try to even see them anymore.</p>
<p>My friend group now just consists of my mom and random tinder dates... and you know? I'm ok with that, I'd rather have no friends than have people in my life who make me uncomfortable and shame me for my opinions.</p>

        <p>Are you talking about relationship loss due to difference of opinion, or due to change in the physical circumstances that supported the relationship?</p>
<p>If the former:  some tense moments with a sibling, but I haven't cut myself off from anyone nor has anyone cut themselves off from me.  However, I have privately lost respect for dozens of people I know, and have had to "snooze" some of them on FB.</p>
<p>If the latter:  yes, but I also moved 3000 miles just at the start of the pandemic, so it's hard to tell which was the true cause.</p>

        <p>Was in the beginning of a good relationship when this started. Broke up in June but was stating to get unhappy in mid April. </p>
<p>I ended up going across the country to my moms for the first two months so I wouldnâ€™t be alone in my studio.  I ended up being away from my bf longer than we were together pre pandemic and I just ...lost interest. Idk if Iâ€™d necessarily still be with him now if this all didnâ€™t happen, but the lockdown chaos didnâ€™t help.</p>

        <p>I've never lost any relationships, but my relationships with my whole family and all my friends are strained. I'm still not going to change my opinion. I don't think them blaming me if deaths happens help them either. I think it's the virus fault for the illness, not people.</p>

        <p>I keep debating one of my friends about COVID policies - masks specifically. A lot of my liberal friends are in medical school so they Iâ€™m sure they think their credibility is higher because of that. Iâ€™ve discussed masks in person with them and usually itâ€™s been fine, not heated or anything. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll lose them as friends, itâ€™s just frustrating to know that if we hang out Iâ€™ll be the one avoiding wearing a mask as much as I can.</p>
<p>I havenâ€™t been in a relationship since this started, but I can only imagine how it must feel if your significant other is a doomer. Must be difficult for many people</p>
