    <strong>Breach of social contract</strong>
    <p><p>Am I the only one regarding this heavy restrictions imposed on us (most around the world really) as a severe breach of the social contract?</p>
<p>The mandate to wear masks all the time, everywhere, recently imposed where I am has been the straw that finally broke the camels back. Ever since, I have lost all faith in society. </p>
<p>The worst part of it is that it made me lose all will to actively participate or care about the society I live in. It has turned me into a selfish asshole fully disregarding any form of public good. That's a point of practically breaking every and any law i think I can get away with. I never thought I'd reach that point yet here I am. :(</p></p>

        <p>&rt;selfish asshole</p>
<p>This is the brainwashing / conditioning speaking. Teaching you it's bad / wrong / inappropriate to place your own interests at the top of your priority list, as though self-actualization and being a productive human being <em>depends</em> on social submission and compromise. The lie of "You're selfish!" is perpetuated by politicians and other <em>truly</em> self-centered meddlers on the regular. Can take some time to break the mindset, but just remember how much you (we) are being gaslit, hoodwinked, manipulated, etc...  </p>
<p>It's <em>they</em> who are the assholes.</p>

I avoid eye contact with anyone who is and if I see someone breaking the "rules" I smile the biggest least akward smile i can and give em a wave. If that makes me selfish so be it. It's perfectly ok to be selfish. Besides, everyone is selfish in some regaurd, it's part of being human.</p>

<p>Where I'm at, they won't let you in without a mask under any circumstances. I've tried it many times, they just tell me to leave, and shop online, and that's even after I tell them I have a medical exemption. No store in my state (or in NJ or DE for that matter) will allow anyone in without a mask due to the statewide mandate.</p>

        <p>I have a bandana, but I haven’t worn it yet. I’ve “worn” a mask 3 times so far, all 3 times I wore it less then 2 minutes. Once at the batting cages with my son because they said you couldn’t go back and coach them without one, so I had a medical mask they gave me, wore it under my nose until we were at the cage, then took it off. Another was at a gas station in Minnesota, borrowed the wife’s because I had to go to the bathroom, wore it under my nose to go in, took it off in bathroom and left without it. Last was in hotel lobby when I needed coffee and the desk person gave me one because it was required, for my coffee and immediately took it off. Other then that I’ve gone without.</p>

        <p>Seems really pointless to me. </p>
<p>What I fucking want is to go into public spaces without a mask, not childishly "gloat" about taking a mask off right when I'm about to leave. </p>
<p>I've received such great advice here (and LDS) on the mask situation, including "throw mask on the ground and stomp on it", and "run past the guy at the door", and "spit in the worker/cop's face and tell them to fuck off"...</p>

        <p>We all want that, but unless you’re already doing that, you are not going to get it. So what to do in the meantime? I’d say to avoid getting arrested or spitting which could easily be used as grounds for assault. My suggestion is more of proving the point that they didn’t win, that the whole process is futile. </p>
<p>You of course can not do that, and wear your mask like a good little boy, or just stay at home a prisoner and whine on reddit, but if you do that the policy will never change. You have to stand up and show people you do not consent. Well, you don’t have to do that, but otherwise you’re just complying nicely and will be walked over.</p>
<p>I sympathize with you, but I know a lot of people personally that bitch about it and then put on the mask like a good puppy. I always mess with people, it’s me doing my part.</p>

        <p>You might try driving an hour or so in a rural direction and going to a grocery store there. It’s not something you can call ahead and ask because a lot of store workers are told to say they are enforcing even if they really arent. Look really nice, clean and put together and go in the evening after the dinner rush. </p>
<p>Also your state’s mandate says that if a place is providing food or medicine they <em>must</em> make an accommodation, even if that’s curbside or delivery.</p>

        <p>I've gone into some rural PA towns, and same thing. Actually, the rural store owners tend to be even more anal about masks, in my experience, and more paranoid about "the spread". One place I went to, had the lady basically thrust hand sanitizer on me forcibly (I asked if I could use my own but she insisted I use hers, which smelled awful), and gave me this long lecture about everything I needed to do while in her store. I didn't buy anything, and haven't been back there since...</p>

        <p>yeah, that's where i am. even though my state is "open" for indoor and outdoor dining, it's so unpleasant and uncomfortable and disappointing that my husband and i don't go out anymore. he runs all of the in-person errands because i refuse to wear a mask in public. i fucking refuse. the only time i will consent to wearing a mask is so that i can go to work; we don't wear the mask in the office, and i need to be at work to maintain any sense of sanity. i refuse to wear a mask at the gym so i don't go, and i'm just working out at home.</p>
<p>i am terrified that i would be shamed and photographed and doxxed without a mask on, and i can't put my job at risk, so now i just stay at home all the time unless i am going into work. it's terrible. i've changed so much as a person in such a short period of time.</p>
<p>i've lost faith in society and government, i've lost faith in mankind. i do not want to live in the new normal. i am a fun, outgoing, gregarious, chatty, Type A, extremely extroverted young woman; i need attention to live, i need to be around other people to function and flourish.</p>
<p>i'm afraid that there will be no place for extroverts in the new normal. where will i go? what will i do? where do extroverts fit in here? </p>
<p>we don't. in fact, if you talk to the doomers, this whole thing is because of extroverts, it's our fault, with all of our hugging and kissing and loud talking and hand shakes and our AEROSOLS and our DROPLETS and our SWEAT and all of this socializing and we're OUT and ABOUT and just SPREADING DEATH EVERYWHERE. death to the extroverts! i've heard people say that they are happy extroverts are the ones suffering here, it's fun to watch us squirm and weep and cry and tear our hair out in frustration. they enjoy punishing us. they like this. WHAT THE FUCK?</p>
<p>i feel like i am being punished every day for simply having the audacity to exist. i feel like i am being punished for being pretty and young-ish and happy and healthy and successful.</p>
<p>is this how ugly people feel all the time? smh.</p>

        <p>I'm an introvert as well. The whole two weeks to slow the spread thing happened and I was like "oh ya no problem I got this! I'll just give a little extra love to my extroverted partner because they were way worse off that me, and things will get better before they know it"</p>
<p>But now I'm fed up and I'm just as depressed as they are most days. I'm pining to be the akward friend at the party right now, or even go to a bar and sing karaoke. Sure i never did those things often, but I never went more than 6 weeks without.</p>

<p>my husband, an introvert himself, has been my rock through all of this. he keeps saying "oh my love, honey, it's only two weeks - it's okay, you can do it, we can do it, we've got this, we're a team." i couldn't do this without him, he's amazing, i love him so much more. i didn't even know i liked him this much, barf.</p>
<p>shout out to the introverts who have been there for their extrovert soulmates, we love you so much! we really couldn't do this without you guys.</p>
<p>you're an awesome partner, and whatever the future holds for you all, i know it will be beautiful. god bless.</p>

        <p>Same. I’m a pretty extreme extrovert here and find myself trying to bail on plans (something I’d never done before) with friends who are still being weird about the virus. For example, a friend wants to meet in a park to have a picnic because she doesn’t feel outdoor dining is “safe”. This is someone who was a foodie who used to love going to restaurants with me and kicking back with several drinks. I have a hard time cutting off friendships and saying no, which is something I need to work on. I get so excited when cashiers and random people still make small talk with me. The other day at a grocery store, a woman stood right next to me to ask about what coffee is good to buy, and I was so happy to chat with someone for several minutes who didn’t give a crap about social distancing.</p>
<p>I still go out as much as possible, but sometimes seeing masks give me panic attacks and I want to cry. My therapist said a lot of the extroverts she works with are really struggling, which is validating, but I’m cranky and tired of losing a lot of my social life, and having to find excuses to get out of the weird social distancing activities I am invited to.</p>

        <p>omg same! i have definitely bailed on so many people - to include my own brother - if the plan involves "social distancing" and/or masks. fuck that. no fucking way. from day one, i have refused to download Zoom, i don't video on MS Teams, and i now regularly decline Skype/Facetime calls. if you don't want to call me or meet in-person the old-fashioned way, you clearly don't want to be in my life. and maybe i don't want you in mine.</p>
<p>like you, i've never been great at cutting people out cold turkey or saying no, and yet, here i am. i have my husband, i have my parents, i have my co-workers. if my friends want to become hermits, germaphobes, and agoraphobes, may god bless and keep them.</p>
<p>i flirt with EVERYONE now - i can't help it! i love the attention, i love the opportunity, i love the socialization. my god, i flirt with the security officers at work every day as i go in, i can't help it. i love and cherish and honor my husband, but my lord, I NEED OTHER PEOPLE. i love making small talk, i love giving people smiles and a kind word. i have always stopped to help people with directions, i have always tried to do the Christian thing and be a good person. it's normal and healthy and good to be excited and stimulated by and respond to other humans! it's literally hard-wired in our DNA!</p>
<p>what your therapist said rings so true with me... i know that myself, my father, my boss - all of the extroverts in my life - are struggling and fighting and treading water, and asking ourselves, "jfc, where do we go from here?" </p>
<p>i am limiting my interaction with the world until they come to their senses. i mute the commercials during baseball now so i can't be brainwashed with their BS targeted messaging. i'm tired of making excuses so now i'm just letting the bitch out. i am who i am - love it or leave it. i'll be here when you come to your senses.</p>
<p>good luck, sweet social friend 🌻</p>

        <p>Same. I’m so extroverted. I love to go out to bars and go dancing and go see friends and hop a flight for a spontaneous weekend somewhere. This “life” is not living at all. It’s hell on earth. It’s a damned purgatory. I know a lot of social people struggling but just thinking “ok I can do this for up to a year or so” but idk what happens when it gets dragged out. People are already getting frustrated and most people really don’t like the tattle tale Karen shit. It’s going to come to a head. I’m ready for these introverted pains in the ass to shut the fuck up and go back to their caving.</p>

        <p>publicly, everyone i know - except my husband, my mother, my father, my in-laws, my boss, my work husband, and my next door neighbors (lol jfc that's a lot of people, huh) - is pro-lockdown. extroverts, introverts, Reps, Dems, libs, cons, everyone. we live in the suburbs outside a major city in the U.S.; we both have professional degrees; we are surrounded in a bubble by other well-educated, well-read, well-travelled, white collar, socially liberal, upper middle class, usually married or partnered, professionals. but in private, people reveal themselves. and people are getting upset.</p>
<p>the introverts i know have become little petty tyrants. they love punishing everyone, they love snitching on people, they love hiding their ugly little faces behind masks. they love making everyone stay home. how dare someone else want to have fun without me! HOW DARE YOU! how dare you be conventionally attractive and flaunt your pretty face? they want everyone to be sad and miserable, just like them. really leveling the playing field.</p>
<p>the extroverts i know don't want to be shamed in public and go along with the group because (a) it feels good to be accepted; (b) no one wants to be outed and shamed; (c) a lot of extroverts i know are empaths and don't want to hurt anyone ever, but they have now bought into the panic narrative. but many extroverts i know are now also scared about the second-hand effects of the lockdowns that are starting to ripple across society, they are genuinely worried about people.</p>
<p>as for me? fuck it. i'm young enough, i'm pretty enough, i am fun, i am social, i'm the life of the party, i'm hitting my stride at work, i have a handsome, successful husband, we have so much life ahead of us. i'm not going to let this stop us, and i don't want it to stop you either. i'm worried about everyone - not just the people who die from (or with) covid-19.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I think maybe there might be more to this than introvert vs extravert. My husband and I live in a small-ish industrial/agricultural rural-urban fringe town, kind of the opposite of a suburb. Our neighbor to the east is alright, just minds his own business like we do, our neighbors to the west are on meth, while the neighbors to the north and south seem to think they belong in your fancy suburb. Many people in my town are high school dropouts who never went to college, not that I necessarily consider college folks more educated, and many are below the poverty line. Politics are the last thing on anyone's mind, or so they think.</p>
<p>The pro-lockdown extraverts I speak of are mostly middle-aged single mothers, either scared silly by big scary numbers they don't really understand or just caught up in what they see as an exciting new fad. The anti-lockdown introverts are people like me and my husband: young and restless, afraid of corporate/government overreach, looking to scrape together enough money for a safe haven way out in the countryside. This house and this town will always be home in our hearts, but it isn't safe enough here. Especially not nowadays.</p>
<p>We wouldn't mind masks so much if they served a privacy purpose, but facial recognition technology can supposedly see right through them. In light of that, we make a point to go out and about with little more than bandanas around our necks, and we'll pull up the bandana for maybe 2 minutes tops if someone says anything. We would be more defiant, but we'd rather not be arrested. Better to play it safe and keep our heads (mostly) down until we can afford some land.  If we get into any legal trouble, that would put a major damper on our plans to go off grid.</p>
<p>Remember: just as not all extraverts are like the ones I know, not all introverts are like the ones you know. :)</p>

        <p>omg yes exactly it's purgatory but it's the worst kind because at least if you're dead you know you'll go to heaven or hell; right now, who knows what awaits us on the other side.</p>
<p>we aren't living right now - we're existing, we're getting by. people are super frustrated and angry, and it's all simmering beneath the surface. i feel like we are all the frog being slowly boiled in water.</p>
<p>the goalposts are constantly moving, so none of us know when we will be allowed to live again normally. the election? a vaccine? the eradication of death, lol? no new caseS? jfc!</p>
<p>i want the introverts to STFU and stay home, order whatever they want from Amazon and DoorDash, stream Netflix/Hulu/HBO/Prime, "work from home!," and just generally let everyone else go back to living a real life. if you don't want to leave your home and expose yourself and your immune system to other people, that's cool. i can assure you that i will never ever cross your path. i'll pay my taxes, i'll leave you alone - i pay you no bills, i pay you no mind. no hair off my balls.</p>

        <p>awwww no way! honestly, lately i've been listening a lot more - listening to anyone who wants to talk or vent or laugh or cry. a lot of people feel so isolated and alone and desolate, so when i meet a kindred soul/spirit, i want them to feel like they're appreciated. most extroverts aren't actually assholes. in college, i always invited everyone to my parties, even if i knew they wouldn't come. i have always had friends in every group, every place i go. i don't have to agree with someone all the time to be their friend. extrovert, introvert, liberal, conservative - everyone has a place at my table and in my heart.</p>
<p>as an extrovert, i have always looked for ways to make people more comfortable and sociable. that's just who i am.</p>
<p>honestly, if there is a place for extroverts in the future, i want to be a leader, i want to be a helper - i want people to see me and say "hey, look at that idiot woman, if she can do it, so can i." if people can see me go to work, take the bus, go to yoga, go shopping, travel, etc, surely everyone else can figure it out too.</p>
<p>get busy living or get busy dying.</p>

        <p>Yes, because Orange Man really represents something called populism. I won't get into whether or not Orange Man is really a populist or just doing it for votes. It's actually irrelevant at this point. Populism has and always will be the enemy of the Corporate-Communist-Feudalist alliance. </p>

<p>This. I said to my girlfriend, "If they make laws as idiotic as wearing a mask everywhere you go and not being able to see your friends or spend time outside... Then I can't take ANY of their laws seriously."</p>
<p>Obviously I'm not going to harm anyone else. I won't commit assault, or damage someone's business, etc. But the stupid laws. (jaywalking for instance) - go fuck yourself. </p>
<p>I seriously wonder if petty crime goes up over the next few years. Same with things like tax evasion. Maybe we should all do a Henry David Thoreau and refuse to pay tax.

        <p>The mask mandate is a violation of the 1st Amendment, which promises freedom of speech and freedom from speech, this is a violation of what the law calls compelled speech, the problem is no one has the balls to file a lawsuit and the media would pull a full blown blackout of any coverage related to a lawsuit against these wannabe dictators.</p>

        <p>there are two groups of Milllennials, really; everyone born 1985 or before is really the tail end of Gen X, or a little micro-generation, the Xennials (Generation Oregon Trail, Gen Catalano). we were in high school or college on 9/11, our childhoods were done by then and we were fully formed people. everyone after 1986 or 1987 is a Millennial. in fact, my husband and i are both 1984 babies, and we can no longer relate to anyone born after 1988. we blame technology, cable, and social media.</p>
<p>ask yourself - did you first have a Walkman, a Diskman, or an iPod?</p>
<p>i'll see myself out, lol.</p>
<p>but back to your original post - it seems to me that most people under the age of 40 are super-pro mask. it makes me sick.</p>

        <p>I had none of the above, Just a cheap off-brand cassette player, a cheap off-brand CD player, then a cheap off-brand mp3 player. :) For what it's worth, I'm a Millennial-Zoomer cusper in a slow Midwestern town where half the people still use flip phones.</p>
<p>Almost all the pro-maskers here are 40s to 60s, which kinda makes sense because they're more at risk. Though they never really cared about their health before. I know one pro-mask pro-lockdown person my age: my husband's cousin. But she doesn't count, she grew up in Tampa.</p>

        <p>my boomer parents are so freaking angry right now. i refuse to paint all baby boomers with one brush - they aren't all selfish assholes. some of them hate this more than we do.</p>
<p>my mom never went along with this lockdown crap - she has been ragging on it since she saw it in China. my dad is just... sad, and it breaks my heart. i want them to enjoy their retirement, to be happy, travel, spend money, drink good wine, eat good meals, make new friends. i want my dad to visit the country his grandfather was born in. i want my parents to be an integral part of my kids' lives. i want to go to more baseball games with my family, go to concerts, to go see the holiday lights, trick or treating... the things that make life worth living.</p>
<p>my baby boomer parents tell me they lived through 1957 and 1968, that my grandparents survived a world war that was ended by nuclear weapons, that my great-grandparents beat back a depression and world war and a pandemic, and that we will be okay, too. that we have already survived 9/11 and the great recession, and that when we were born, no one ever thought the USSR would collapse in our lifetimes. my mother says we are fighters, my father says we are leaders. </p>
<p>i do not want to punish the baby boomers - all i want to do is live freely, with the people i love, in a normal way. i don't have the time or energy to hate people and punish them. it's the way of the world -  i need to keep living and going. we can play the blame game all day, but it's not useful. time only goes one way - we can't go back and fix the past. let's just do better in the future.</p>
<p>my parents gave me life - i won't ask them to waste theirs.</p>
