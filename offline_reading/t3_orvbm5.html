    <p><p>I saw that Spanish expose /awareness campaign, it was specifically on the importance of detoxing the graphene oxide as a matter of urgency. Listed a bunch of supplements to be expected, trying to help. One of them is <strong>astaxanthin</strong> in shellfish and it was interesting what he said next, <em>"they tell you not to eat shellfish after the injection"</em> which is hideously diabolical but also pretty damn telling. </p>
<p>So my question  is what else do they tell you not to do after va$$x? Did I hear you're not supposed to exercise? So then exercise would be a way of reducing the damage because they want to maximise damage not lessen it.</p></p>
