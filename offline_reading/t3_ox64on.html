        <p>Yes, science deniers spreading misinformation.  Natural infection does absolutely confer long term immunity:</p>
<p>https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-19</p>
<p>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2780557</p>
<p>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/live-better-longer/202104/are-we-immune-covid-19-if-weve-been-exposed includes info on t cell immunity and it's usefulness against variants.</p>
<p>and is far superior to their shots at dealing with variants, no matter how many boosters they get:</p>
<p>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.29.454333v1</p>
<p>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/delta-infections-among-vaccinated-likely-contagious-lambda-variant-shows-vaccine-2021-08-02/
&rt; Among fully vaccinated people who never had COVID-19, getting a third dose of an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer (PFE.N)/BioNTech or Moderna (MRNA.O) would likely increase levels of antibodies, but not antibodies that are better able to neutralize new virus variants, Rockefeller University researchers reported on Thursday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. They note that in COVID-19 survivors, the immune system's antibodies evolve during the first year, becoming more potent and better able to resist new variants. In 32 volunteers who never had COVID-19, they found that antibodies induced by mRNA vaccines did evolve between the first and second shots. But five months later, vaccine-induced antibodies were "equivalent" to those seen after the second dose, with "little measurable improvement" in the antibodies' ability to neutralize a broad variety of new variants</p>

<p>The immunity is temporary from your first link, says modest decline after 6-8 months</p>
<ol>
<li>For second link. Same thing. </li>
</ol>
<p>&rt;    Natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 appears to confer a protective effect for at least a year, which is similar to the protection reported in recent vaccine studies. However, the observation ended before SARS-CoV-2 variants began to spread, and it is unknown how well natural immunity to the wild-type virus will protect against variants.</p>
<ol>
<li>For third link, same thing but with t-cells as well in refernce go longer immunity for specific cells</li>
</ol>
<p>&rt;    Recent research backs this up with Covid-19, as a study revealed about 95% of people retained immune memory up to at least eight months, and durable immune responses are suspected to last even longer.</p>
<ol>
<li>Then thereâ€™s this for the fourth link stamped at the top </li>
</ol>
<p>&rt;    bioRxiv posts many COVID19-related papers. A reminder: they have not been formally peer-reviewed and should not guide health-related behavior or be reported in the press as conclusive.</p>
