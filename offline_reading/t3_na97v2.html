    <strong>To my fellow Michiganders!!</strong>
    <p><p>All Michiganders should be aware that MIOSHA has submitted a proposal (Request for Rulemaking) to make current mandates permanent. It is currently in step 3 of 6 which includes a public hearing to be held virtually on May 26th for anyone interested   </p>

        <p>...they also stated in the paperwork that they expect it to take about 6 months to be approved, which would put it right about when the current mandates are supposed to end (surprise surprise)</p>

        <p>The majority of our family is here too, but we will most likely move if this passes. We spent about 3 months this year in FL and SC, and being back in MI has been a struggle compared to how nice and open things were down there.</p>

        <p>I currently live in Michigan and am pursuing a PhD. The past year-ish has demonstrated that I'm capable of doing this remotely, and since my supervisor is relatively busy and hands-off, we're expected to be incredibly self-sufficient. Once I find out at the end of this month whether or not I've made it to candidacy, I'm planning to arrange to move out of this state to one that is open.</p>
<p>Remote work is fine. Remote work in a locked down state is a recipe for insanity and misery. I've had enough. I will move back when this place is completely back to normal, but even then I'm not so sure.</p>

        <p>We are in the exact same mindset. I was laid off due to covid and my husband can work from anywhere with internet so we spent about 3 months so far this year between FL and SC. It was glorious and we are really struggling being back in MI. It also doesn't help that we live in an area that is very "big" on enforcing the mandates which makes us feel crazy after being in states that are open. It makes us question why we should bother paying to have an apt here</p>

        <p>I feel the same way. I went to a conference down in Florida about a month ago, and being back in Michigan, I feel like I'm in the twilight zone. I cannot unsee the contrast, and I hate being back here. Either Whitmer's reopening thresholds will never be reached, or they are eventually reached and a vaccine passport system is coming for enforcement purposes, or a super scary variant will be used to justify continued mask mandates and lockdowns. Whatever it is, I've had enough and don't want to live in a state that's run like this.</p>
<p>I think it's best I start looking for apartments down in Florida or Texas.</p>

        <p>Agreed, it's like once you know places are basically going about life as normal you can't unknow it and everything happening here seems even more ridiculous than it did before. Now there was just the announcement that on July 1st people who have had the shot don't have to wear masks indoors. I wonder what will happen with the MIOSHA rules. If the rules pass, people have to put masks on again? Although I am not sure how much it matters because a lot of people in the comments said they weren't taking their masks off even if they have had the shot soooo.... <br>
But yes, my husband and I are reaching our wits end. We are debating breaking our lease (because why pay to live somewhere we feel we can't enjoy) and are debating between getting a new place in FL or SC (the Gov of SC has also outlawed passports and mask mandates), going the route of some sort of tiny house/rv/moveable dwelling, or bouncing between month long stays at airbnbs/Landings hmmmmm</p>

        <p>I don't know what to think about the July 1 expiration date. On one hand, I'm skeptical that that will actually happen, depending on how many people in the state get vaccinated. I'm not getting the shot, so there's an incentive to leave.</p>
<p>On the other hand, even if the mask mandates ultimately expire before my current lease (Aug 1), I don't feel like a free person living in this state anymore, especially since I'm located in a very blue city. Whitmer just decided to do this, and it was purely a political decision. She could just as easily bring back her more authoritarian mandates because of a "scary" variant, or for some other political endeavor like climate change lockdowns. Also for the past year, I have felt incredibly alone with my beliefs, my values, and my anger at all of this. I have a couple of friends who are on my side, but I want more than living in a city where 70% of the people there would love to see me burn because I won't get the vaccine or because of my politics.</p>
