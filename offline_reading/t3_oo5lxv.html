    <strong>Thought discussion on positive Covid test</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys, </p>
<p>Fuck Covid and everything going on these days. I'm writing this from the beautifully free liberal country of Canada, where we have a wonderful substitute drama teacher for Prime Minister. Anyway, I digress. </p>
<p>I wanted to pose the question and thought experiment to those of you who are vaccinated, or people you know that are vaccinated. </p>
<p>So you have both shots, go out for dinner and come down with something.  Immediately, you kneejerk and run to the local pharmacy to get an unreliable Covid test.  You test positive, the test then gets reported and round and round we go. </p>
<p>Wouldn't this all stop, if people just stopped getting these fucking tests? Are all these tests happening because we're being socially programmed to "do the right thing"? </p>
<p>You get a cold, or the flu, you just have those things and stay home until your better. </p>
<p>Why the testing, unreliable at best, and only feeding this retarded situation?</p></p>

<p>Yes. And we couldn't really get tested at first, for most of 2020. Now, the radio tells us every 20 minutes to get a test and multiple people post in my local areas facebook group that you should get a free, rapid test before any activities today, right now!</p>

        <p>Well this is my point. So let's break it down:</p>
<p>Get an unreliable test before you do anything. 
Test gets reported to whatever for more fear mongering. 
Being Vaccinated or not, doesn't matter. 
More reported cases means more lockdowns.
More lockdowns means more propaganda to get vaccinated.
Vaccines not effective, carry risks, and pharma not responsible for reactions.
Vaccines have a private patent, funding more propaganda.
More propaganda and restrictions means increase in testing</p>
<p>We're full circle. </p>
<p>Going to bring up Trump for a second, but he literally said in 2020 that the reason the US has the most cases is because they're testing the most. Politics aside (even though it's all political), at this point even the fully vaccinated (not exclusively) people that are pin-happy going to cry wolf with a little sniffle are just feeding this propaganda further and further. </p>
<p>More testing means boosters in discussion. This is fucking madness.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, they'll demand tests and test those who can't say no, like in nursing homes and hospitals, to get on a plane or join some event.</p>
<p>Then there'll be those who will still get tested and then, at the end of the day, they just need to dip a few of the tests in fruit juice to make them pop positive.</p>

        <p>You are exactly right!!!  The only reason for testing should be if your admitted to the hospital for symptoms. My husband had to get tested to leave the state for work. Which I thought was crazy cuz he had no symptoms and you cannot spread it without symptoms. Another thing that changes through this crazy thing. Crazy world we live in. It’s all about power and money and so easy to freak everyone out with tests( which are unreliable to begin with)</p>

        <p>Yes. I’ve said this so many times.</p>
<p>I was asymptomatic, I was not ill. If I hadn’t known about Covid (just imagine this was a normal day for a minute) I’d never have gotten tested and never known. It wasn’t even like a cold, I had ZERO symptoms. I felt stupid as fuck every time the NHS rang me to ask if I was okay, I was like yeah completely fine I’m just bored stiff lmao</p>
<p>When I went into hospital recently for gynae issues, I had to do a Covid test. It was negative but had it been positive, I’d have been counted as a Covid in hospital case lmao.</p>
<p>At this point they’re looking for it. Look for something and you’ll find it, but that’s not the same as it being a problem. Look at MRSA for example, loads of people carry it on their skin relatively harmlessly, we don’t start mass testing for it unless there’s a specific reason that person may be vulnerable</p>

        <p>We dont test for the flu or require proof of flu vaccination. We don't do that for herpes or any other STI. </p>
<p>Fucking retarded joke. People are being lulled down this road of "safety" one step at a time. Jab over jab year over year.  </p>
<p>Trudeau just agreed to Pfizer boosters until 2025. Now if they're freedom of choice like the flu shot, then fine you do you. But if this stays around, people are getting fucking mad.</p>

        <p>Yes. The mass testing is the problem. If symptoms, it should be rapid test followed by a PCR test at max 28 cycles at your doctor’s office. That’s it. That’s the only way this stops</p>
