    <strong>It's okay to not have a scientific reason you don't want a new normal</strong>
    <p><p>Science has increased our comfort and economic success greatly, and most importantly lowered infant and childhood mortality rates. Most scientists are good people with noble intentions.</p>
<p>Science is not something we have to base our lives off of though. We don't have to rush to get the newest technology or vaccine or follow the advice of every new study. Not a single anti masker or lockdown protester has caused as much damage to the world as nuclear weapons, climate change, plastic, and pesticides. That was science. Maybe if we hadn't rushed into those things we would not be as reliant on those things today as we are. We are headed towards a global disaster due to these things. in the last century, we peasants have been forced into changing our lifestyles, jobs, diets, time spent with our children, and consumption habits because wealthy people decided new technology was going to make our lives better. Now our children are becoming suicidal and we are all high and everyone is plugged into a screen almost 24/7 and we are being told we used too many plastic straws and have to buy electric cars and switch to green energy (which may cause just as much damage as carbon when it comes to habitat destruction). And then they spring the new normal on us and say that whatever studies say we must follow. </p>
<p>I don't think there is a single method or way of study that can truly calculate every single variable to be able to tell us whether lockdowns and masks are really better for us. You may be an uneducated ignorant peasant like me, living in a trailer in rural America and watching your kid and chickens run around but it doesn't mean you aren't qualified to decide what is best for you and your family.</p></p>

        <p>True man, there's this sentiment in our culture that your beliefs have to be backed by some sort of academic literature/scientific study or they are invalid, as if our own life experiences are not the things we should use to form our views of the world. </p>
<p>Its kinda ironic since the majority of people using studies to back their views don't read or comprehend the literature they are citing, and often cite studies that disprove their point. Its just some empty token to claim a monopoly on truth.</p>
<p>I think in general people have their own ideals and fill in the blanks with a justification afterwards. It's perfectly reasonable to not like the way covid has pushed our society and to choose to live how you see valid.</p>

        <p>Yes, especially for us Americans. I don't think the word study or science is mentioned once in the Bill of Rights. </p>
<p>And a lot of the people helping to produce those studies are college students getting master degrees probably squeezing a lot in while hungover. I know many people that are very intelligent with Master's but I also know some that probably shouldn't be the reason we start mandating things. </p>
<p>I agree. I definitely think there's deeper divides going on than just what's on the surface. People for masks and lockdowns probably overall had have pleasant experiences with authorities in their life so have no need to start questioning now</p>

        <p>I would go a step further. Your education and experience level may mean others are more qualified to make a decision you’re facing in your life, and they still don’t have the right to make it for you.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. People have decided death is the worst thing that can possibly happen these days. Probably due to secularization. If we didn't have unqualified people making potentially unsafe choices in the past we wouldn't have had the American revolution, pioneers, cavemen setting up societies out of nothing, etc.</p>

        <p>Just found out today that Egas Moniz, the inventor of the full frontal lobotomy got the nobel prize for medicine in his time.</p>
<p>We're no more intelligent now than we were then. We just have more experience and collected knowledge. Makes me wonder what practices that are seen as revolutionary now will be seen as barbaric in the future.</p>

        <p>I agree. My Aunt basically wanted a presentation on why masks and lockdowns don't work, while she got why masks work from the media. It should be up to the doomers to defend their position because lockdowns om this scale is experimental and never tried before. They are abnormal. We are normal.</p>
