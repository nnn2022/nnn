    <strong>Compliance and discipline: Are we living through a real 'Third Wave'?</strong>
    <p><p>Are people familiar with the 'Third Wave' experiment in California in 1967? (details in the link)</p>
<p>I can't stop seeing the similarities with that, and what's happening right now in terms of creeping authoritarianism and populations that are happy to lose their freedoms in exchange for compliance and discipline. The command: 'wear a mask'. The slogans: 'I wear this for you, you wear yours for me', the increasing police state, the public informing on others for minor transgressions, their apparent feelings of superiority, the denigration and shaming of resistors, overt public displays of allegiance, and the symbol of the cause - the mask.</p>
<p>This is a textbook group process where leaders have managed to rapidly change the behaviour of the collective and quash critical thinking and reasonable debate about what it is that's happening. Yes, the virus is real and does need to be kept at bay. But at the expense of our most basic freedoms? Without any concern for the <strong>individual</strong> and their emotions and thoughts and feelings? It is all about 'the group!' And the group has turned nasty.</p>
<p>I think we're seeing a seismic sociological shift happening across the world - and not a very good one. It's a worry. Personally, I've no idea where it'll all end up - but what is important is that people like you and I continue to challenge, ask questions, debate, be a rebel, and have confidence in our gut feelings. Don't do something <em>just</em> because everyone else is. If it feels wrong, it's probably because it is.</p>

        <p>No. I did not know about the third wave. That was an extremely interesting read.</p>
<p>"When the pleasure of belonging outweighs your ability to question you must force yourself to recalibrate."</p>
<p>I have seen this happen in social groups in years past. I have been guilty of going along myself because I was in the group that belonged.</p>
<p>We're all human and fallible if someone finds the right button to push. This is a great reminder to watch carefully and choose carefully. If the US continues along this authoritarian path, I don't know where I'll go.</p>

        <p>There's a documentary about it called 'America's Nazi Experiment', was on Sky History here in the UK last month. Really interesting, the real life teacher and some of the now grown up students are in it.</p>

        <p>I would take the F and banishment to the library for the rest of the semester. I can imagine that's most people on this sub as well.</p>
<p>The problem I see is there's a lot more of "the quiet middle" than there are of people like us.</p>

        <p>You may be absolutely genuine in saying you would take the F, but it's always dangerous to assume such without having to experience it firsthand. Many a grave mistake has been made with a preface of "it can't/won't/couldn't happen to me." Most of that "quiet middle" fell into that trap without ever being aware it happened. The best you can do is never assume, always question. Including your skepticism.</p>

        <p>True, we can never say that won't be us.</p>
<p>We're awake now, but may not have been under different scenarios. </p>
<p>Everyone thinks they would never be taken in by something like that, the pro-mask people won't currently realise they're falling into a group mentality. </p>
<p>Even I, totally anti-mask, was considering buying some today because I feel I can't fight it for 6months to a year or however long the country will be forced to wear them (stopped myself though!)</p>

        <p>Yes, we are living through that.</p>
<p>There is a document from the UK that describes how politicians and social media can force compliance and it is very similar to that (can't find the link but it is somewhere in LDS).</p>

        <p>There's defiinitely something sinister in the way it's not 'wear A mask' it's 'wear THE mask.'</p>
<p>Just like the term 'vaccine hesitancy.' I'm not anti-vaccine, but it's a weird term, like if I was in 1930's Germany, would I be called 'Nazi hesitant'? Or 'Party hesitant' during the they heyday of Communist China?</p>

        <p>I have no problem with masks; it is "just a mask" and is not a slippery slope.  It's a small price to pay and can do good.  What pisses me off is governments closing businesses which does little net good and brings a thousandfold more pain.  </p>
<p>That said, leftists are authoritarian, yes.  Some dictatorships were formed out of the very same mindset you find screaming at the hideous "protests".  I think it's this whole Floyd reaction/assumption/projection that is more worrisome in terms of authoritarianism than the reaction to the virus.  Even though not government mandated yet, it's a situation where you are not allowed to criticize the "blm" (bowel) movement without losing your job or being forced to give some ridiculous apology and beg for forgiveness.  No dissent, no shading of opinion.  THAT'S scary.</p>
<p>This comes as the world is dealing with the worst crisis in a century, and yeah, I'm sure some are glad at how they can try to tear down society when it's weak.  The race war bullshit I think has taken people's focus off the virus.  Most people are against the "protest" idiocy, and I think they've been saying "Fuck this" and not focusing on being safe.  Just a theory.</p>

        <p>Sorry, it is not "just a mask". It gives me a huge amount of anxiety. It makes it hard to breathe. It dehumanizes me and you. It anonymizes me and you. Physical contact has been reduced by lockdowns and now we can't even see each other smile. It makes us fear each other. It robs us of individuality and steals our identity. It's not "just a mask"</p>

        <p>Walking down the street, arrows everywhere, markings on the floor, keep your distance, stay 2 metres back, stand behind the plexi-glass, lines, boxes, stickers, signage,  wear this, don't wear that, MASK! sanitise your hands...blah blah blah. It's really dehumanising and demoralising.</p>
<p>At weekend I went to a shop to buy a new mobile phone (decent bit of cash) and was met at the door by a worker who told me to 'step forward into the box' like I was walking onto the gallows or something lol. Joyless.</p>

        <p>'just a mask" and you are already down at the bottom of that slippery slope you managed to deny you slid down. <br>
Whenever the rights of the group outweigh the rights of the individual, then the value of any individual in the system is exactly ZERO.</p>

        <p>Right, and it won't stop at "the mask" either. Next ppl will likely push for or support a vaccine mandate and they'll be telling others "just get the vaccine!", or they will call those ppl who refuse it "selfish", like now if we don't wear a mask (even if we're not sick!).</p>
<p>It's not really the mask itself, we know that it is just a mask that we can easily put on and take off whenever we feel like, it's the mandate and apparently symbolism of wearing it that ppl are creating now that is the problem.</p>

        <p>Leftists are not authoritarians, authoritarians are authoritarians. That is, some leftists are authoritarians, and some are not, just as some on the right are authoritarians, and some are not. They exist on both sides of the spectrum, which is why in some political discourse, you see the left-right axis perpendicular to an authoritarian-libertarian axis. Don't rely on labels; always watch the policies.</p>
