        <p>They are narcissists wearing an empath mask.</p>
<p>This was made especially obvious in their attitudes toward those suffering mental illness, poverty, job loss, children struggling in online schooling and people losing everything when their small businesses go under.</p>
<p>And don't be fooled. 2020 did not make them this way. 2020 revealed who they have always been.</p>

        <p>It's NOTHING to do with altruism. These people who are screaming at you about you being selfish, are deathly scared of the virus themselves, aka they're self-interested. It has nothing to do with the wider community. "Altruism" would have more credibility if they themselves were not afraid. But almost all of them are.</p>
<p>You really need to read this, and why calling others selfish is you being selfish yourself: <a href="https://www.catherinebruns.com/a-therapists-rant-on-the-word-selfish/">https://www.catherinebruns.com/a-therapists-rant-on-the-word-selfish/</a></p>

        <p>I am basically a basement shut-in not affected to much by the lockdowns and I am still against them due to altruism. Anyone who thinks the lockdowns are a net benefit to society are brainwashed or willfully blind. It completely up ends previously held values by prioritizing people at the end of their lives over the youth and society as a whole.</p>

        <p>Except...absolutely none of this bullshit is about altruism at all. One of the most enraging things about all of this is how the Covidians claim they are such kind, caring, selfless, empathic beings, while they portray their opposition as the callous, selfish, sociopaths. It's a disgusting fascist tactic and it's absolutely sickening. These are people that are wreaking complete havoc on every facet of society. Children's education and development is being ruined. Millions have lost their jobs and careers, and businesses. Millions around the world sink deeper into poverty. They are giddily using and disposing of more plastics and waste than ever with their stupid mask and other covid theater obsessions. Shows how the never truly have a damn about animals and the environment. They support shit that has caused immense mental anguish all over the world  They've condemned us all to this dystopian hell. And those are just a few of the things they have done, all because they claim that they care about people dying from a respiratory virus, as if such viruses and pathogens have never existed prior to March 2020. It's all horribly disingenuous and the biggest act of collective narcissism in history. Don't be fooled by their shameless, blatant hypocrisy and their hollow, fake morality. Don't fall for their sanctimonious bullshit that this has anything to do with them being unselfish or morally superior in any way.</p>

        <p>Well psychological Egoism is proven to exist.  And as far as i know nothing substantial proves Altruism to be true, atleast not true in the sense that it applies to human behaviour, thoughts and feelings.   Sure Altruism can have Survival instinct benefits.  But it either must assume that those you’d help are as altruistic as ones own self and or the deal given is better then trying to do it on your own.   Like the rise of Agriculture is a proof of this,  It was more practical then keeping up with hunting and gathering.   So it was a win/win for everyone.</p>

        <p>Fake altruism, self-righteous garbage to make themselves feel good about themselves. Nothing screams privileged bourgie lib more than supporting insane policies that have destroyed the world in less than a year. It's the latest trend for them to virtue signal about what wonderful heroes and saviors they are.</p>
<p>I've said it so many times before and I will say it again, because it must be reiterated often and it completely destroys their little sanctimonious "it's about saving lives and muh deadly global pandemic" NPC mantra. These people want to LARP an apocalyptic pandemic because it's fun for them and makes them feel good about their shitty selves. Gives their mindless existences a stupid sense of meaning and purpose. </p>
<p>They want to enjoy all the amenities of modern life and get all their products, with no understanding of how those things are even possible. If this had truly been some sort of real plague, do they actually believe that they could sit all safe and cozy in their nice homes making Tiktok videos while their electricity, water, and internet stayed on and they could get any food or product delivered to their doors? </p>
<p>So they either a. Know deep down that this is not really a deadly plague at all, but love to keep pretending it is or 2. Still think it's that dangerous and deadly and are terrified of getting covid themselves, but truly don't give a damn about the hundreds of millions of workers out there working every day so society stays running.</p>

        <p>Well, the thing is.  Humans are actually only capable of only so many deep feels for other people.  150 people that you give any shits about at all is about the max, and single to low double digits for deep caring.  It's called Dunbar's Number.</p>
<p>I used to think I was a sociopath or something because if am brutally honest, there's a whole lot of people I actually give no fucks for.  I mean, if something horrible happens, I recognize that it was awful, I make the appropriate noises and say the appropriate words because it's expected of me, and logically I know it was horrible, but I just don't have the give a fuck.</p>
<p>Every so often something gets to me though - and it's almost always when something awful happens to a kid.  </p>
<p>I'm not a sociopath though.  I'm normal.  Start embracing the fact we're normal and know that the people that claim they really care deeply about random strangers are most likely lying.</p>

        <p>Our primal nature is to care...</p>
<ol>
<li>more about our family than our tribe</li>
<li>more about our tribe than our nation</li>
<li>more about our nation then our race</li>
<li>more about our race than our species</li>
<li>more about our species than other species</li>
<li>...</li>
</ol>
<p>Our primal nature is to care for others in a hierarchical manner, depending on how close they are to use genetically (see Dawkins's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene">"The Selfish Gene"</a>) and/or culturally... which in the past largely overlapped.</p>
<p>Socialization can overrule this layer cake and even cause people to hate certain groups they're a member of, favoring other groups instead. This is in fact what is currently happening to many young people today. Especially young White men are trained to hate their race and gender alike, and favor women and members of other races instead.</p>
<p>This is not natural. Nor is it healthy. The further we are removed from our primal nature, the more neurotic and psychotic we tend to become. And this is harmful both for ourselves and those around us.</p>

        <p>This comment sums it up exactly , death is a part of life. Everybody dies at some point and while it is very sad , I think we should be more at peace with it as a society . No one was doing any lockdown or be careful of others when the flu was a thing , like no one was like don't go to the pub because your grandma might die.</p>
<p>the current lockdown and protect others,  It's fearmongering and places an undue burden on everyone to "do their part" but I don't want to do my part on the chance that some old person dies. I want to live my life.</p>

        <p>No bc its not a simple as giving up your life for a year. Some people commit suicide, are stuck in environments of abuse, starving, failing out of dumb online school. A lot of these consequences are permanent. There is no logic for why some people should sacrifice and some should not. Why should some people sacrifice their lives and some should not? Even if you were a god and could say that more lives would be saved if xyz people sacrificed (which aint even the case now) that would A) be impossible bc no one is a god. And B) Be extremely unfair to the people who were doing nothing but minding their business. Certain groups are not more entitled than others.</p>

        <p>The second Great Commandment is "love your neighbor as yourself." You can't actually fulfill that unless you do love yourself; that is, unless you will that which is good for you.</p>
<p>The idea that there is a hierarchy of obligation wherein those closest to us ought to be the first/preferred recipients of our giving is perfectly reasonable. Thomas Aquinas defends it against some common objections in his Summa theologiæ (IIa IIæ 31.3):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3031.htm#article3">https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3031.htm#article3</a></p>
<p>As a Christian, Aquinas understands that such a hierarchy is not absolute, and justice requires in certain cases that someone more distantly connected be preferred over someone who is more closely connected, but this does not invalidate the general principle of the natural hierarchy of obligation, much less serve as a general justification of self-destruction.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that lockdown falls afoul of Aristotelian/Thomistic thinking on the common good and natural rights, as well-explained here by the philosopher Ed Feser:</p>

        <p>Pure altruism very well may not exist. I was thinking more along the lines of making small self-sacrifices rather then shedding blood. Also that sacrifice would be more in the name of self interest in a society where we all depend on the skills of others.</p>

        <p>I would argue that we are not made to operate in a world this complex and alienating, and that is the cause of so much of depression, anxiety, and other psychological issues that are on the rise. We are trying to force ourselves to operate for a way in which our brains and bodies are not wired.</p>

        <p>To be fair it's quite sociopathic, that's not the issue here, but rather that all the "caring" measures combined do fuck all to help anyone and each one on its own causes devastating harm. Let's not give in to the doomer rhetoric about us not caring. We need to stay focused on the truth without ceding anything to the lie. I'm not sure if this post might be a doomer troll in disguise.</p>

        <p>I’ve been saying this since the first time I heard people saying they “care” and following up with something like “your mask protects MEEEEE” or “you’re putting MEEEEE at risk”. Really? YOUre the caring, decent one, and those of us who care about our mental health and comfort, as well as the businesses and families of OTHERS are the sociopathic, <em>selfish</em> ones? Go blow it out your arse. Not only are these people sociopaths, they also don’t generally think before they spew their pontificating nonsense, and it shows.</p>

        <p>no, i specifically address his assertion that the 'self' is an illusion</p>

        <p>Who said anything about masks. I don’t like masks but I don’t really mind them either. I’m talking about social distancing, no events, and everything being closed. You guys try to reduce this to the mask issue as a way to dismiss our concerns. Also your username checks out</p>

        <p>yes sure social distancing doesn’t allow touch with anyone other than your close family but you can still talk in person, online, facetime, etc. Not only that but doing social distancing still is better than letting random people not giving a fuck about a virus we have no vaccine for and spreads unknowingly. I do understand that some people can’t do social distancing for very long but until the virus is suppressed it will spread again if we open prematurely like last time. Even if 0.1% of the US ends up dying, thats still like 300,000+ people? to me that’s not a joke. If you want this over quicker, i hope you chose the right candidate who won’t repeat what happened in the summer when people opened bars, casinos, etc. back up</p>
<p>At least we have food takeout, large nature-based places(national parks for example), and probably other places with easy social distancing still.</p>

        <p>I didn’t vote, but if I would have it would have been for Trump. I’d rather die than have to do everything virtually. Take it elsewhere, most of Reddit agrees with you</p>
<p>Have you considered the fact that a lot of people live alone?</p>
<p>Edit: also, I don’t even see many people outside of very close friends and family, but we don’t adhere to any of that bs. And sorry if I come off as hostile... you’re entitled to your opinion as I am mine</p>

        <p>ive been reading around here and it’s crazy what i’ve seen people say. it’s almost like some governments are actually trying to make testing available and help prevent the spread of a virus that kills thousands of people per day now.</p>
<p>masks can be uncomfortable but wearing one takes little effort and saves lives(yes you may not know the other random people you save nor are you exactly responsible for their entire wellbeing but its human decency to do something so simple and keep people who may not be able to fight off coronavirus more safe)</p>
<p>to those of you dont believe that people are dying to corona, go to a hospital in a major city and see for yourself</p>
