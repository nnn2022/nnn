        <p>Just a reminder - the FDA approves drugs, not the NIH or NIAID. The FDA answers to HHS, HHS answers to presumably the surgeon general - all trump appointees in 2020 in addition to the head of the CDC. If drugs like hydroxychloroquine actually worked trump and his appointees could have given patients access. But they didn't. What happened there?</p>

        <p>How a False Hydroxychloroquine Narrative Was Created</p>
<p>"1. You stop doctors from using the drug in ways it is most likely to be effective (in outpatients at onset of illness).  You prohibit use outside of situations you can control.<br>
Situations that were controlled to show no benefit included 3 large, randomized, multi-center clinical trials (Recovery, Solidarity and REMAP-Covid), which are generally believed to yield the most reliable evidence. However, each of them used excessive doses that were known to be toxic; see my previous articles here and here.<br>
2.  You prevent or limit use in outpatients by controlling the supply of the drug, using different methods in different countries and states.  In NY state, by order of the governor, hydroxychloroquine could only be prescribed for hospitalized patients.  France has issued a series of different regulations to limit prescribers from using it.  France also changed the drugs’ status from over-the-counter to a drug requiring a prescription.<br>
3.  You play up the danger of the drug, emphasizing side effects that are very rare when the drug is used correctly. You make sure everyone has heard about the man who died after consuming hydroxychloroquine in the form of fish tank cleaner.<br>
4.  You limit clinical trials to hospitalized patients, instead of testing the drug in outpatients, early in the illness, when it is predicted to be most effective.<br>
5.  You design clinical trials to give much too high a dose, ensuring the drug will cause harm in some subjects, sufficient to mask any possible beneficial effect.  You make sure that dozens of trials in dozens of countries around the world use these dangerous doses.<br>
6.  You design clinical trials to collect almost no safety data, so any cause of death due to drug toxicity will be attributed to the disease instead of the drug.<br>
7.  You issue rules for use of the drug based on the results of the unethical, overdosing Recovery study.<br>
8.  You publish, in the world’s most-read medical journal, the Lancet, an observational study from a huge worldwide database that says use of chloroquine drugs caused significantly increased mortality.  You make sure that all major media report on this result. Then 3 European countries announce they will not allow doctors to prescribe the drug. And Sanofi announces it will no longer supply the drug for use with Covid, and will halt its own clinical trials, based on a fabricated study.<br>
9.  Even after hundreds of people renounce this observational study due to easily identified fabrications–which, as James Todaro, MD, wrote was a “study out of thin air“–the Lancet held firm for two weeks, serving to muddy the waters about the trial, until finally 3 of its 4 coauthors (but not the journal) retracted the study. You make sure few media report that the data were fabricated and the “study” a fraud.  You let people believe the original story: that hydroxychloroquine routinely kills.<br>
10.  You ensure federal agencies like FDA and CDC hew to your desired policies.  For example, FDA advised use only in hospitalized patients (too late) or in clinical trials (which are limited, are difficult to enroll in, or use excessive doses).  As of mid June, FDA now advises patients and doctors to only use the drug in a clinical trial!<br>
Another example:  you have FDA make unsubstantiated and false claims, such as:  “Hospitalized patients were likely to have greater prospect of benefit (compared to ambulatory patients with mild illness)” and claim the chloroquine drugs have a slow onset of action. If that were really true, they would not be used for acute attacks of malaria or in critically ill patients with Covid. (Disclosure:  I once dosed myself with chloroquine for an acute attack of P. vivax malaria, and it worked very fast.). Providing no other treatment advice, CDC refers clinicians to the NIH guidelines, discussed below.<br>
11.  You make sure to avoid funding/encouraging clinical trials that test drug combinations like hydroxychloroquine with zinc, with azithromycin, or with both, although there is ample clinical evidence that such combinations provide a cumulative benefit to patients.<br>
12.  You have federal and UN agencies make false, illogical claims based on models rather than human data.  For example, you have the FDA state on June 15 that the dose required to treat Covid is so high it is toxic, after the Recovery and Solidarity trials have been exposed for toxic dosing.  This scientific double-speak gives some legal cover to the clinical trials that overdosed their patients.<br>
According to Denise Hinton, RN, the FDA’s Chief Scientist, or a clumsy FDA wordsmith:"</p>

        <p>Wow that sounds like a really elaborate plot to prevent patient access to hydroxychloroquine. Hundreds if not thousands of researchers, clinicians and healthcare workers around the world must have been in on it - probably on George Soros' payroll. You know they tried to hide HCQ to hurt donald trump's re-election chances - that poor guy. Everyone is corrupt but him.</p>
