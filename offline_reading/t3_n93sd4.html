    <p><p>Don’t forget, Hong Kong was getting uppity with their protests in  2019...that too was a factor...and Trump. Both were squashed by “Covid”.  </p>
<p>This was all planned.</p></p>

        <p>No Biden's not - and in his speeches he mentions how he's holding the line against the CCP's autocracy. Biden's just being rational, reasonable, and not being loud about it as is how Trump behaves; you shouldn't worry about a loud bully who can't be discrete (because they're obvious), you should worry about someone who has self-control, can use words - eloquent language - and a strong stance with the backing of the military - to hold the line; nuance that Trump doesn't understand or have the capability to do, he's all marketing and TV ratings driven - he doesn't understand and can't do subtle; and it seems many of Trump's supporters can't identify nuance and subtlety either, they depend on loudness and physical signs of aggression in order to think that's a show of power, when it's actually a weaker stance - and once you can transcend that animal aggression, to tame it - you can then turn that aggression into language, and promises for action if certain lines are passed, certain rules of freedom that the West and democracies have been upholding and fighting for - including the right to bare arms (to protect against potential tyranny, police state, etc); if you want a serious example of someone who has mastered their inner beast, GSP (MMA champion Georges St-Pierre), on Lex Fridman podcast recently - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIPxfzfOTxk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIPxfzfOTxk</a>- I believe it's towards the end of the interview: where GSP explains that he used to make the mistake of putting his energy/anger into his body to try to intimidate his opponent - only later learning that he should just look at his opponent with a smile on his face just thinking that he's going to kill him; that's arguably much more intimidating, and confusing for an opponent.</p>

        <p>What do you mean by "secretly" though? They fully admit that the US is their enemy, just like they fully admit that propagating communism throughout the entire world is one of their main goals, so... What's secretive about that?</p>

        <p>I wouldn't call myself studied, I don't even speak Chinese, you know. But I did read "unrestricted warfare" by Qiao Liang and whatever the other PLA guy's name was. You might want to read the thing. It describes pretty much what's happening for several years now and they do literally call it warfare. And if you want to see some real inflammatory stuff coming from the very top of the CCP apparatus, you'll unfortunately need to research stuff that's being published by Xinhua and in Chinese. The stuff they prep in English for western conduction tend not to be that outrageously blunt. Having some Chinese friends do help ;)</p>

        <p>Sure but he resisted the lockdowns. Feds can't override state policy by executive action (congress could). Also trump said that if you have the vaccine go back to normal unlike fauxi.</p>
<p>Not saying trump was perfect, but at the fed level he was way better and had proper instincts. His mistake was not firing fauci and others because he was trying to win reelection.</p>

        <p>Sure, I won't deny that fact that he resisted as much as possible. Would have been more prudent to push hqc to avoid the use of the eua of the vaccines in the first place. Also how did it get past him to pay out 3x for ventilators? There are still questions regarding his actions.</p>

        <p>Yeah I agree. I believe he didn't push hard because he wanted to build a large voter base of people who may not be traditional trump supporters.</p>
<p>I mean I like trump but he is a people pleaser. I think he wanted americans of all backgrounds to love him which is why he compromised himself and tried to moderate his tone. He mentioned hcq and the media shat on him so hard. I don't see how he could have pushed it through without facing another fake impeachment attempt. You forget how anti trump the entirety of congress was during his last year. It's hard to fathom and recall to me even now.</p>

        <p>Trump passed an act for hospital price transparency. He also tried hard to pass a bill that would allow people to get access to experimental treatments if they were willing to take the risk. I believe that his thought on vaccine were similar. I think he wanted people to have the option but I do not think that he would have been forceful about it at all were he still in office.</p>

        <p>What a lot of people don’t realize is that Trump didn’t make any decisions lightly. He tried his best to surround himself with experts and other intelligent individuals to make sure he was making the best decisions he could. One of those individuals was unfortunately Dr. Fauci. I think he didn’t really know what his opinion should be and he didn’t want his opinion to influence others.</p>

        <p>They’ve hid the plan well and created a situation where anyone who dissents is shamed or even dehumanized. They’ve condemned any use of violence from their opposition and praised its use when it furthers their own goals (antifa/BLM have been useful pawns). What can we commoners really do to fight back and end their control and manipulation? There will come a breaking point that we’ve tended to avoid thus far, but I don’t see another outcome being possible. </p>
<p>The writing has been on the wall before, during, and after Trump. He is only a symptom of the larger problem that is becoming more and more apparent to Americans that are waking up.</p>

        <p>Trump wasn't "squashed" - remember there are huge military operations taking place all over the world. The main card the DS holds is threatening to do FF attacks against civilians. So COVID was flipped and used to the military's benefit. It sucks, but if people are off the streets there are less targets and thus less leverage for the black hats to use. </p>
<p>Biden is being run out of fake white houses at Amazon studios culver city, Baltimore, and Atlanta. It's a puppet show while the real stuff happens behind the scenes. Look up the term "controlled opposition". The real problem is that the average person is so dumbed down that they have to be shown what kind of tyranny they were passively supporting.  Anger makes people irrational but it also drives people to take action.</p>
<p>There are layers of truth beyond what you know is happening. If you think you have all the facts, that's not just ignorance but arrogance. The more angry you are, the more of both you're still working with. If you can acknowledge that you may be ignorant of facts or your self-importance may be puffing up your ego beyond the truth, then you can start to learn more. Most people on either side don't actually want to learn and evolve as people, they just want to be right and force their will, which is exactly what the tyrants are doing.</p>
