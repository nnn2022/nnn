    <strong>Just found this sub, I have some questions</strong>
    <p><p>So are you guys against lockdowns (Eg the one that's started in the UK)</p>
<p>Do you think COVID is real?</p>
<p>Do you think masks useful, harmful or are useless</p>
<p>Do you think that the COVID cases/deaths are being accurately reported</p>
<p>What do you define as the new normal</p>
<p>Do you support social distancing measures</p>
<p>Do you hold any beliefs that COVID is a way of controlling society</p>
<p>Do you believe that COVID is being used to create a new world order?</p>
<p>Do you believe that the COVID vaccines are designed to be intentionally harmful</p>
<p>How different will society be when the pandemic is over compared to 2019?</p>
<p>If these questions sound strange it's because I have intentionally wrote them in a way that should have no bias, I just want to hear your opinions on things</p></p>

        <p>I'm against lockdowns, yes. I believe that if people are scared for their safety, they need to take measures to protect themselves, rather than making everyone else protect them. A comparison would be someone who's worried about dying in a car accident insisting that no one drive anywhere between the hours of 7 AM and 8 PM.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is real. It isn't as severe as the media makes it sound.</p>
<p>Masks are useless, honestly. I think they stop bacterial spread, but don't do jack against viruses. If you're sick, it won't hurt to wear one. Most people are not sick.</p>
<p>Again, I think numbers are being inflated. I don't think people are differentiating between "deaths <em>with</em> COVID" and "deaths <em>from</em> COVID".</p>
<p>The "New Normal" is basically acceptance of extended governmental mandates and control. It's accepting that masks will be a permanent fixture from here on out, and we'll never be able to gather in groups larger than 10 again. It's not a good kind of acceptance. It's more complacency.</p>
<p>Social distancing is silly. Sneeze juice can travel up to sixteen feet. Breathing on someone probably won't get them horrendously ill.</p>
<p>I'll answer the next three in one go. The virus is 100%, absolutely being used as a form of control. Most people don't do things out of the good of their hearts. It goes against human nature. Make no mistake, the politicians enforcing this are loving that when they snap their fingers, everyone jumps. And we gave it right to them without a fight. New world order? Maybe. It's definitely started to shape society in a very concerning way. As for the vaccine... I don't think it's meant to be intentionally harmful. I just don't trust how quickly it was developed. I need to see the long-term side effects before I will consider getting it.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is ever going to end. Again, "new normal". They can come up with a "new strain" of the virus whenever they like, or say that cases are rising. It's so easy to manipulate facts nowadays that it isn't even funny.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you got something from that. I really hope you're here looking to learn, instead of just screenshotting this stuff and posting it on r/Covidiots or something. We need more genuine discussion without hostility.</p>

        <p>I disagree with a fair part of what you have said but since I asked your opinions, I'll try and explain mine</p>
<p>I think masks have some use but I'm unsure, I wear them just encase they actually have a function. Though I do think they are useful as it should reduce particulates</p>
<p>Social distancing is useful as it's the reason why people sneeze into their elbow as it reduces the chance of it circulating in the air</p>
<p>I like the lockdowns as I directly benefit from it as now my Y11 exams are canceled but now my fate is in Gavin Williamson's hands</p>
<p>I think the vaccine might be harmful but not intentionally as it seems like governments are kicking themselves to get the economy back, see America.</p>

<p>[Gavin Williamson is the UK’s minister for education if you didn’t know]</p>
<p>Here’s where you hit the nail on the head, you just need to consider whether you really consent to that.</p>
<p>We all feel like this. Our businesses are being forced to open and close constantly and on the whim of the government. Many of us have no scope for financial planning; we have no way of knowing what we’re earning from one month to the next. Our future is in the government’s hands. Imagine I’m a pub landlord, I want to trade, my customers want to buy beer from me. The government tells us neither of us can get what we want. </p>
<p>Your life is yours and you shouldn’t need to ask their permission to live it. We’re all being robbed of our autonomy and being treated like naughty children for daring to say that we’ve had enough of it after what’s now approaching a year.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I was 16 once and I’d be absolutely thrilled to find out that my GCSEs were cancelled. However, people also earn a living invigilating and marking those exams, for example, for them it’s their means to put a roof over their heads and feed their children that’s being cancelled, people who have tried to plan ahead in tough times and were relying on that income. It could happen to your parents too.</p>

        <p>It all comes a point, if COVID is as bad as it's made to be, which chances are it probably is as my friends parents had it and said it was horrific, my personal view is that the lockdowns and measures are worth it if the virus is as bad as it's ment to be. I've been personally hoping that we went back into lockdown otherwise my exams would be fucked so Gavin Williamson's and Borris and fuck shit up all they want as I'm happy with my predicted grades, so if they mess it up then I'll just resit them in November.</p>
<p>Really the only thing that annoys me is that I won't get a grade 9 (A star) in my computer science but that's just me moaning over pointless flexes.</p>
<p>I understand that the economy is fucked right now and that people are out of jobs, but people are dying in droves so I think a lockdown is worth it if the stats are true. The NHS is overloaded (Doesn't help that they have been making it worse for the last 10 years)</p>

<p>Many are of the opinion that the stats are questionable if not completely untrue. The PCR test was never intended to diagnose disease and used en masse on people showing no symptoms. You can find Karey Mullis, the Nobel Prizewinning inventor of the test talking about this. Unfortunately he died last year and he cannot speak for himself right now. The number of deaths is recorded as “within 21 days of a positive test” so the numbers are surely inflated, especially when you consider how many tests are being done, even deploying the armed forces to some areas to knock on doors and offer tests. Flu and pneumonia deaths are down 95% for some reason, might it be that the tests being used in the way they are isn’t a reliable source of data? With all this in mind, it’s reasonable to call the stats into question especially when they are broadcast into millions of homes in this most scaremongering way. What kind of crisis has the government constantly reminding you to panic about it?</p>
<p>The government has been robbing the NHS blind for ten years now and it’s not as well funded as comparable institutions elsewhere. It doesn’t help that they waste a lot of their funding also. I haven’t worked for them directly but I have as an outsourced contractor in patient reviews on psychiatric wards. The number of times I turned up to these, often after a journey of several hours, to be told that it couldn’t go ahead for whatever reason and I just had to turn around and go home was staggering, and we invoiced the NHS in full for a full day and travel expenses on each occasion. By the time the rest of those other contractors required at the review had done the same, it could cost them up to £5000 a time. They had a chance to address this in the summer, they didn’t, we paid the price and were locked down again in November. </p>
<p>Where does the NHS get its funding in the first place? Taxes of course! Who pays the taxes when millions are out of work? You tell me! Logic dictates that you might tax big tech corporations, billionaires etc. more heavily, but the rich will always squirrel away their money where the government can’t get to it. </p>
<p>So there you have it, a nation steadily going bankrupt, forsaking its citizens, exerting more and more control, ignoring any opposition, criminalising everything and everyone, turning a blind eye when anyone with power fails to meet these same expectations, looking the other way when suicides and abuse skyrocket. People are poor, they are hungry, they are angry and mistrustful, ideal conditions for violent riots. I’m here because I don’t want it to come to that and I think the best way is to end lockdowns. I’m not expecting you to agree with me, but I would ask you to think about when the cure becomes worse than the disease and when the point will come when you too decide to say no to the new normal.</p>

        <p>Covid is real</p>

<p>Covid cases and deaths are WAY over reported</p>
<p>The new normal is any infringement or changes on our rights/society since approximately February 2020</p>

<p>I don’t believe the vaccine was designed to be harmful. I believe that the vaccine probably has harmful side effects (why there’s no MERS or SARS vaccines) and should only be given to the elderly.</p>
<p>I think society will go back to complete normal by 2022. I think in 2030 we will look back on this “pandemic response” as a complete embarrassment and failure.</p>

<p>There is zero scientific evidence that a "new virus" exists. There is only a fraudulent new test. </p>
<p>CDC has confirmed that 2020 deaths are identical to 2019 deaths, other than population growth.</p>

<p>Some social distancing. Like what you would do in a flu season</p>
<p>Absolutely they are using this to control society</p>
<p>Possibly</p>

        <p>&rt;So are you guys against lockdowns (Eg the one that's started in the UK)</p>
<p>No idea what the UK is doing. But yes. </p>
<p>&rt;Do you think COVID is real?</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>&rt;Do you think masks useful, harmful or are useless</p>
<p>Useful to extent. They're being protraid as being something they're not. And the homemade napkins are worthless. N95 are legit. </p>
<p>&rt;Do you think that the COVID cases/deaths are being accurately reported</p>
<p>Nope. A vehicle accident where the driver was ejected and died on scene was counted as a covid death.</p>
<p>&rt;What do you define as the new normal</p>
<p>Anything closed. Masks. Stupid policy measures. We'll have unessesary measures after covid. Just like unessesary measures like the TSA after 9/11</p>
<p>&rt;Do you support social distancing measures</p>
<p>If you want to. I'm not going to distance from friends/family, but if I go to a store and someone is visibility sick, I'll keep my distance. I don't support any enforced social distancing. </p>
<p>&rt;Do you hold any beliefs that COVID is a way of controlling society</p>
<p>It definitely is. This new generation will have some psychological issues I can almost guarantee it. </p>
<p>And them trying to eliminate individual critical thinking skills. Trust "ThE sCiEnCE!" </p>
<p>&rt;Do you believe that COVID is being used to create a new world order?</p>
<p>Don't care. </p>
<p>&rt;Do you believe that the COVID vaccines are designed to be intentionally harmful</p>
<p>Probably not. Are they possibly harmful to some, sure. </p>
<p>&rt;How different will society be when the pandemic is over compared to 2019?</p>
<p>It's already so far off the deep end from 2019</p>
<p>If these questions sound strange it's because I have intentionally wrote them in a way that should have no bias, I just want to hear your opinions on things</p>
