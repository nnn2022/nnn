    <strong>I am physically unable to wear a mask. My boyfriend had a heart attack and I was with him in the ER. This is my mask experience.</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve tried to wear the mask. I suffer from panic attacks. I put the mask on and can’t breathe, I start to panic and cant breathe even worse which makes me panic and I spiral downhill to where I hyperventilate and get dizzy and am rendered incapacitated.  </p>
<p>I took him to the ER.  The front receptionists and triage nurse sitting out front commanded with extreme smugness that I had to wear my mask in the waiting room or I had to leave. I explained I couldn’t and they said it was the rule. I held the mask in front of my face but didn’t put it on so I can breathe around it and get air.  Once we got to the back the nurses said they didn’t care if I wore it or not as they have on masks and it was fine. </p>
<p>The hospital I took him to wasn’t equipped to deal with heart issues so the flew him in a helicopter to a heart hospital about 30 miles away. </p>
<p>I drive there and they put him in the ICU. I get to the desk and the security guard stops me and tells me to put on the mask. I explain I can’t wear one and he says I can’t go in. So I put the mask on. </p>
<p>I start the downward spiral as they stare at me like I’m some kind of freak. One guard asks me if I’m sure I want to do this and I say of course. I want to see my boyfriend. I have all of his clothes and personal items to bring him and I’m going to push through and do it.  He said he would walk me there.  I literally collapse twice while on the way. He’s kind of starting to freak out. I get to the door to the ICU and he tells me to wait there. I take off the mask while he’s gone. No one is around FFS. A nurse comes out and is calm and factual and not at all smug or condescending. She repeats as if she has to do her job that this is a section of the hospital I have to wear my mask. I told her I will and to please just bring me there is it’s prolonging my suffering. She lets me take off my mask and get myself together and gets me a wheelchair and insists she doesn’t want me to end up a patient there.  I get in the wheelchair and get to the room. My boyfriend takes one look at me and says I have panic attacks with the mask. </p>
<p>The guard leaves and the nurse says I can take it off when she’s in there and that she had panic attacks as well. She has to follow the rules and is sick of this shit. So now I get to visit but if someone else comes in I’m to put the mask back on. </p>
<p>He’s doing well now and actually had several heart attacks. Got a stent put in a 95% blocked artery and hasn’t felt his good in a while. He is coming home today and I have to get him. </p>
<p>I loathe the fact I can’t wear a mask. All of the signs telling me I’m a shit person if I don’t. All the smug faces of people who think I’m lying. iT’s JuSt a pieCe oF ClOtH!</p>
<p>I felt like utter shit when they wheeled me in and he was comforting me!  After he had heart attacks and surgery. I was weak when I should have been strong for him and I feel terrible. </p>
<p>Fuck everything about this!  Fuck Fauci and his lies and fuck this political theatre using us as pawns in their worldwide chess game. </p>
<p>Wish me luck when I go back. I can’t wait to bring him home. He’s my everything and I want to be there for him.</p></p>

        <p>Remember during the Android saga when Goku was fighting that heart virus that almost killed him? Ya think he’d take a vaccine to prevent that? You think he’s wear a mask to prevent that? Or should he just let it run it’s course? I mean saiyans do get stronger after taking a beating….</p>

        <p>Considering the questionable (at best) efficacy of mask wearing this amounts to forcing you to participate in a political charade regardless of how doing so affects your health.  Seems like the one nurse understood and had to walk a tightrope between rigid policies and actual compassion.</p>

        <p>Ya I got a few of these for situations like this where you can't get around not wearing one, and it's a game changer. I have a similar claustrophobic anxiety thing with the masks as well...the type of mask and how it fits, the material, etc makes a big difference actually.</p>
<p>Side note, curious if your boyfriend had the vaccine before the heart attack? Seems like it's happening a lot</p>

        <p>I got it online from a company called "fake mask usa".. they have different types, I got a mesh one that is more incognito, it's black and hard to tell when someone is looking at me, but its complete mesh that you breathe though and it barely feels like it's constricting the breath at all.</p>

        <p>I have panic attacks too. I had to wear it under my nose at work and hold it away from my face when shopping. I finally got a mesh (completely breathable) mask which has helped a lot. But mostly I don't wear the fucking things.</p>

        <p>This is not a physical issue, it's psychological. I've worn many masks with a pulse ox monitor while exercising and have done the same exercise without a mask. My data shows a negligible difference between the Spo2 readings with or without mask (largest variance was .2%). My personal experience is further supported by research. YMMV but this is definitely not a physical issue. You are panicking for whatever reason, but I can assure you that you are not breathing significantly less oxygen, mask on or off</p>

        <p>Sure, but it's still a phycological thing. Fear/panic are psychological ailments than may manifest themselves in physical ways, but you are not losing oxygen because of the mask. I can empathize with you and it's a hard situation no doubt, but it's not the mask that's causing this.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your concern but this is really splitting hairs.  It may not be from lack of oxygen but it doesn’t matter why to me. All I know is I put on the mask and feel anxious. Maybe it’s the anxiety causing my inability to breathe and that causes me to spiral.  It is something I can’t mind control away, I’ve tried. I’m aware how stupid it is but can’t control it. </p>
<p>I bought a few of the masks another person suggested as I’m willing to try anything.</p>

        <p>FFS sake you BF had 3 heart attacks is in very bad shape, has a stent and 90% of this post is about you , you, you.  Drs and nurses wear masks 8 to 12 hours a day to care for people like him  Not just because of Covid but to prevent the spread of other bacteria and viruses  Especially in a hospital where people obviously are not in great health to begin with, </p>
<p>Right now I am sitting in an infusion chair receiving chemotherapy with 5 other patients. We are all wearing masks and are required to.  Some are very sick and some or doing well. We will be sitting here for 5 to 8 hours to get these drugs in us.   I was seriously abused as a child. I've been locked in small places and have PTSD and an anxiety disorder and I can get through this.  It's a damn mask.  You are making it more of an issue than it actually is .   Probably because you are an attention seeking drama queen who is on here bitching instead of thinking about your boyfriend with a major heart problem!</p>
<p>jeeze,  oh and my nurse says hi.. she is also stuck in a mask and doing just fine. </p>

        <p>If I was in a heart attack subreddit you would be correct, however, since the subject matter was about the mask, I chose to discuss that. </p>
<p>You’re incredibly fortunate that your anxiety from past trauma doesn’t manifest in a way to prohibit you from wearing a mask. I wish I could because of people like you who think because they can, everyone else can.  Turns out, I have panic attacks from wearing masks.  </p>
<p>I hope things go well with you regarding your cancer.  I wouldn’t wish that on anyone, even selfish twats such as yourself.</p>

        <p>I remember a couple years ago, before the Covid bullshit all started, when people on Reddit would always talk about how some people have disabilities that are invisible to others, and that just because something is easy for one person (or even the majority of people) to do, doesn't mean that everyone can do it, and we need to be more understanding that everyone has different traumas they are dealing with.</p>
<p>What happened to that way of thinking? Now instead there's just assholes like you insisting that someone must be lying or exaggerating, because you can't wrap your thick skull around the fact that everyone has different needs.</p>

        <p>Nurses never wore masks before. Just so you know. Nor did cancer patients sitting at chemo infusions. But you keep on thinking masks will protect us from big bad scary viruses since they never have in the past. Also OP is much nicer I hope you rot you self righteous bitch.</p>

        <p>Lmao, ops partner likely doesnt care about the internet.</p>
<p>In that situation, he would rather seek comfort from those who are close. I know this because I feel the same way.</p>
<p>When I was at deaths door, the only people I even wanted near me were the people that I love.</p>
<p>I dont see the need to ridicule OP for seeking some support if they are still innocent enough to seek the validation from internet strangers. We should be supporting her so that she has energy to keep seeing him and keep his spirits up.</p>
<p>I mean, makes more sense than coming to someone's post and feeling the need to belittle them for being different lol.</p>
<p>I am really curious if op's b/f has been vaccinated. Or if they have been having problems. But it's best not to answer that. Don't really want to feed the metaverse and the targeted ads. If they want to share their medical history sure, but I wouldnt share someone else's.</p>

        <p>I will answer that. He has not been vaccinated or had previous heart issues.  </p>
<p>You are correct that I just needed to vent to a community that can relate to me instead of insulting me.  I hear over and over again why I’m a piece of shit everywhere I look so I thought I would come to one little place where there are like minded people for some support. </p>
