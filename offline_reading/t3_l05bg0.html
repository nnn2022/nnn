    <strong>is covid really that harmless?</strong>
    <p><p>I am definitely a covid skeptic and frequent this subreddit along with a few other similar ones. I don’t believe that masks work and disagree with the lockdowns. But i can’t help but notice that some people in these subs tend to downplay covid a bit too much or minimize it to just “the sniffles” when I already know two healthy and youngish people that have died from it. Although I don’t think covid is so bad that we need all these pointless measures, I don’t quite understand what the science is behind thinking that it’s mostly harmless. I mean 375k+ in the US have died. I understand that maybe those numbers are exaggerated, but more or less that’s a lot of deaths. Where are we getting the 99.9% survivability statistic from? I’ve looked online and it seems like covid has an almost 2% mortality rate. Also more deaths from covid then the flu or pneumonia. If I am wrong, please correct me! I’m just looking for actual sources i can look at to understand that point of view and maybe reassure me. I am worried about some of the long-haul symptoms as well. As an athlete it scares me that some people just aren’t recovering. Are there any studies behind that as well? Do people tend to talk about their covid horror stories more than those that had mild cases so it seems like covid is more harmful than it truly is? I need some insight. Sorry this is all over the place but I would appreciate some sources to check out to help answer these questions.</p></p>

        <p>I think most of us believe that yes Covid is serious. But so is type 2 diabetes, so is the flu, heart disease is serious, cancer is serious, obesity is a serious problem, and the list goes on and on. The amount of resources put toward this and the media attention is what frustrates us the most. Put this sort of magnifying glass on any ailment, and it would look horrific.</p>

        <p>Let us make a documentary detailing the ten worst cases of type 2 diabetes. Cases where people lose their eyesight and have to have one or both of their feet cut off. By the end of the documentary, we’ll all be moved emotionally to tears. Same for people dying of cigarette related lung ailments. If you look hard enough for people dying horribly miserable lonely deaths, they were here before Covid, and they’ll be here after we’ve gotten past this.</p>

        <p>As I’ve stated before they are counting test as positive cases. 
Any death in a hospital is counted as covid. 
You got 6 bullets in a gun. 5 of those bullets are long term killers. 
Heart related issue. 
Diabetes 
High blood pressure 
High cholesterol
Lung issues . 
Bologna 19 aka covid 19 shows up and aggravates or increase issues in one of the others. You die from the hospitals negligence when you come in for one of the other 5 bullets and catch the 6th bullet. Now they count the 6th bullet as the only killer when you’ve been shot 5 other times</p>

        <p>For me personally, even if a second coming of the Black Plague arrived, I would still have a problem with government telling me what I can and cannot do about it. I didn’t sign a social contract, and wish to be left the fuck alone. So really, the severity of the virus has no bearing on how I view the response.  We can’t give up freedoms every time we get scared. We’re all going to die anyways, but our kids and grandkids and so on will live with whatever fucked up authoritarian government we leave them.</p>

        <p>How "serious" a disease is, is purely subjective but there is a unironically a very serious problem with telling people that this disease is serious. The flu kills millions of people every year, but is it "serious"? Most people (at least pre-2020) would have said no. So why is that?</p>
<p>Well the flu is normal to people. They understand it as something in life that they needn't be concerned with, because there is little that they can do to mitigate it and even less that they can do which would not make their own lives measurably worse. Basically, they understand on an unconscious level that the best way to deal with flu, from a holistic overall cost benefit  point of view, is to just act like it doesn't even exist, unless they actually catch it. So when they say that it is not serious, what they really mean is that they don't care about it. When you say that a disease is serious you are telling them that they should care about it, that there is something that they should do about it. </p>
<p>Given the amount of damage done by lockdowns and masks and the almost complete lack of any actual good done by any corona-virus control measures I think that by far the best thing would be for most people to just act like the virus doesn't exist. All those epidemiologists and doctors who were feeling resentful, like an entitled three year old, that they just weren't getting enough attention and decided to scare people. They were completely wrong to fear monger.</p>
<p>So when I talk to people I tell them that the virus is not serious. Because I understand that the best thing for most of them and especially for the society at large is to go on living their lives as though nothing is different.</p>

        <p>For anyone healthy under 50 or 60, covid is almost certain to be less serious than the flu. Most won't know they had it, most won't have more than trivial cold symptoms.  The flu kills more kids than covid.</p>
<p>Covid has absolutely not killed 375k in the US. We only have two ways to determine a covid death. One is the attending doctor saying, in the absence of any test "this was surely due to covid." That one is clearly bunk. The other is a pcr test. Somewhere between 50 and 90% of positive pcr tests have shown not to have culturable virus. That is, the person didn't have covid. So probably half of those covid deaths didn't have covid at the time of death. Which puts covid in the realm of a rough flu season. Because we're also on our second year of the disease.</p>
<p>In some elderly, immunocompromised, other people in very poor health, or the occasional anomaly, covid can be serious. But in general, especially if you are active and get your vitamin d (like, say, the Japanese) covid isn't an issue.</p>
<p>People only believe it is because of bad stats and scary anecdotes.</p>

        <p>Yeah, they're simply not what PCR does. Pcr looks for RNA. It's very good at it, finding even the tiniest samples, which means fragments of diseases can be found literally months after you were sick, or even if you were immune and fought off the disease, or other cases. There is a rough inverse correlation between cycle count and odds of finding live virus, but it's probabilistic, not deterministic, so you could find rna at 20 cycles and be fine, or 45 and be sick.  This is why pcr should only ever be used to confirm disease in a sick patient, not as a primary diagnostic.  Even then it can't determine if someone died from covid instead of their late stage cancer.</p>

        <p>Covid is def serious. But not even close to as dangerous as they want you to think. </p>
<p>I think the 99.9% stat you see get thrown around comes from the total deaths divided by the population. So in America for instance, the chances of having died from covid in the past year were roughly 0.1%. I think the overall infection mortality rate is about 0.3-0.4% in the US, a few times more deadly than normal seasonal flu. In countries with healthy populations, the IFR is probably close to that 0.1% number. </p>
<p>But if you are relatively young and healthy the chances of dying from this virus are essentially negligible- far less than 0.1%</p>

        <p>i often forget that over 60% of americans are overweight or obese and that’s probably a huge factor as to why there’s so many deaths. covid seems to disproportionately affect overweight people.</p>

        <p>In a few studies I have seen they talk about what factors are the most decisive in determining how many fatalities a country will see.</p>
<p>Having an old population is #1.  General healthcare situation is #2.  Obesity is up there as well, somewhere.  How quickly a country reacts is also decisive.  All of those things will have a big effect on how many people die from Covid in a country.</p>
<p>And then "severity of lockdowns" had almost no effect on the number of deaths.</p>

        <p>There is also an argument to be made that by the time a new and dangerous strain of anything is discovered and identified, it’s too late for us to do anything about it. Covid didn’t come into existence the moment Wuhan announced it’s discovery, it was already spreading within the community, aboard airplanes, on cruise ships, and in all forms of mass transit. We live in a global world now. That comes with consequences, it’s getting harder and harder to hide from the power of Mother Nature.</p>
