    <strong>If things are ever going to get back to normal, we need to stop giving money for UI</strong>
    <p><p>Can we talk about the impact that unemployment benefits are ruining people? Not only do they pay people to do nothing, but it's causing people to become more dependent on the state. It causes people to be weak, lazy, and apathetic. Businesses can't find people to hire because the government is giving people more money then they are able to pay to stay at home. What is it for some people, $1000 / week to stay at home? Of course people would choose that over working at some $12/hour job.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the whole global supply chain is getting disrupted. Commodities are skyrocketing. The price of <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/1icn9h.jpg">lumber is up %125+</a> in the past year. As is grains, metals, real estate... practically everything except appliances (the shit we buy from China).</p>
<p>It's like the Iraq war all over again, where we created a huge mess and there is no exit strategy. But what must happen is that they need to at the very least phase out UI. Maybe give employers that money for hiring bonuses?</p>

        <p>No one is  "giving money for UI", it's being borrowed.</p>
<p>How can you debate the merits of one government program vs another when the government will likely just borrow for both?</p>
<p>Talking about military budget, entitlement budget, <strong>is pointless without a Balanced Budget amendment or constitutional guarantee</strong>.</p>

        <p>If we were to follow your proposal of a "balanced budget amendment", the pain that 100+ million people would feel would be too severe and sudden to manage and they would take to the streets and follow some demagogue... leading us to something of a communist revolution. People are already riled up over cultural/political differences, take away their comfy government jobs and UI, well now they are not only filled with extremist ideas they are also hungry and unemployed.</p>

<p>Given the massive money printing combined with the banks reserve requirement set to zero since May 2020, we may feel these effects anyway as inflation sets in. Though it all depends on what trickery the fed is able to pull off over the next couple of years to keep the game going.</p>

        <p>UI has its merits bit it is a system that needs reworking. </p>
<p>When I needed ui, if I made more than $30 in a week, it meant i was no longer eligible that week and had to wait another week for my check of roughly $130, no taxes taken out.
I have no idea who was getting so much for ui cause as far as I know it depends on the State. </p>
<p>So you wonder why people may be dependant and its because your government doesn't want them to have real income. As soon as you make an attempt you may not eat that week.</p>

        <p>Who knew giving people money "ruined" them lol. Nobody is getting ruined by being able to afford to eat and pay bills. Guess we should have just thrown everyone out on the street now that would have been healthy living!</p>
