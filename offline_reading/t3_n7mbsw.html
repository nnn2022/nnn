<p>Link with previous RT-PCR testing protocols around the world (if you have doubts, please do your own research as they differ from country to country, only thing in common is the 36+ cycles everywhere):</p>

<p>Short description to understand: RT-PCR testing requires a "final product" (the viral genome in this case) in order to set an accurate number of cycles.This missing, the cycles are randomly set to a value that gives 80 % + positives (27 and higher) no matter what you test (sars-cov2 in papayas, goats, cats, monkeys, other creatures, plants, lion mars bar, and so on). Since the "viral fragment" was "discovered", all the tests were ran at these values everywhere, giving reason to call it "a pandemic" (the meaning of pandemic was changed in 2009 by a CCP member -&rt; you don`t need deaths anymore, just cases)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Usual deaths + RT-PCR incorrect use(or intentional since the inventor of RT-PCR mentioned multiple times that they cannot be used for this purpose, before dying, 3 months ahead of this pandemic start) = Covid19 pandemic + Pandemic murderous protocols</p>

<p>CDC now tells everyone to use double standard -&rt; Vaccinated to be tested under 28 resulting in a very very low amount of covid19 cases (as it was normal from the start), while those unvaxxed will be tested as normal, and change it for everyone maybe in the future so they can say that you were saved from the 'pandemic'.</p>

        <p>Just looked at your 2nd link there and here is the smoking gun right at the top.</p>
<p>&rt;As previously announced, CDC is transitioning to reporting only patients with COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infection that were <strong>hospitalized or died</strong> to help maximize the quality of the data collected on cases of greatest clinical and public health importance. That change in reporting will begin on May 14, 2021. In preparation for that transition, the number of reported breakthrough cases will not be updated on May 7, 2021.</p>
<p>This will definitely make the number of "breakthrough cases" plummet.</p>

        <p>One correction, the breakthrough guidance Ct is only for samples sent for sequencing. It still shows the higher Ct for "diagnostics" is bullshit though.</p>

        <p>Thank you for explaining. Wish i had the new guidances from other countries also to see if they also changed this.Like U.K, where the cases after vaccinations droped alot, even tho a university professor says that over 60 % of the new cases infected with Covid19 are vaccinated.</p>
