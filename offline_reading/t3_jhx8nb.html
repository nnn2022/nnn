    <strong>If masks are the new normal, my new normal is being a hermit for the rest of my life</strong>
    <p><p>Without going into great detail, I have medical conditions, breathing issues combined with panic attacks (PTSD from a traumatic experience), and anything tight around my face or neck sends me into panic mode within minutes. Because of this, I’ve left my house exactly three times since March. Fortunately, I own my own business and work from home. Also fortunately, my husband is able to handle wearing a mask in order to be allowed into the grocery store to get food for us. I honestly never thought I’d live in a world where grocery shopping would be a privilege no longer extended to me as society gaslights me about my conditions supposedly not being real. </p>
<p>Yesterday was my most recent excursion out of the house and I was really anxious about it. We went to an early voting site and it was about 85 degrees. Since I can’t wear a tight mask, I brought along my favorite infinity scarf and pulled part of it up loosely over my face just to avoid harassment and ensure I would be allowed to vote. I live in a very rural area and there weren’t a ton of people there anyway, so it was easy to social distance even inside, but everyone there was wearing a mask also. It took about 10 minutes total to vote, and I was hurrying in the end because I just kept getting more uncomfortable and overheated. I felt like I was going to pass out. That was the longest 10 minutes of my life, but voting is important so I did it. I have no idea how people are okay living like this! </p>
<p>If this is the “new normal,” my future looks pretty bleak. When you think of a shut-in, you picture an old lady, right? You don’t picture a mostly healthy 36-year old who’s just been deemed a social pariah because she can’t handle tight face coverings. </p>
<p>My breathing issues are my own business and I’ll assess my own risks. I don’t want anyone shutting down their businesses and lives and wearing face diapers to “protect” me. Besides, I’m pretty sure I already had COVID in December (my parents and I all had the same thing, later my dad tested positive for antibodies). It wasn’t fun, but it also wasn’t a big deal. My dad, btw, is over 80 years old with existing health issues and it didn’t affect him any worse than a flu-like virus either. </p>
<p>I want normalcy. I want to go sit somewhere that isn’t my house and drink a draft beer with my husband, maybe play some bar video games or pool. I want to re-plan the trip to Vegas that we had to cancel. There is a 100% chance that life is going to eventually end in death, so why are we being bullied into not living our lives while we still can?</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m very frustrated. Thanks for listening, random internet strangers.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the award and the comments! The responses on this thread are really helping me. I finally feel heard.</p></p>

        <p>I hope masks don't become the new normal. It's not only problems for people with PTSD, anxiety and claustrophobia, but also for people who are deaf, with autism and children. It's not healthy to hide your facial expressions and it causes communication problems.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, pre-COVID19 modern people in the West criticized face covering and cultures for having them. France wanted to ban all face covering in certain positions in the public and there were the whole face covering debate. Nowadays almost everyone supports the face covering.</p>

        <p>It was associated with crime! And, a couple months ago I was attacked by 2 men—of course, wearing masks. I am ok, I was able to escape, but the guys robbed and killed a guy a few ocls away 20 min later, and I am unable to help in identifying them. Pisses me off. </p>
<p>Are people wearing masks in banks?</p>

        <p>That is pretty wild, isn’t it? I really hope the masks go away eventually and this is all just a bad memory. It’s really hard to hear people talking from 6 feet away while wearing a mask, and the lack of facial expressions feels really weird. It’s like everyone is dehumanized with face coverings, just cogs in a machine rather than people.</p>

        <p>My husband tried to go to his annual physical earlier this year and they made him wait in the waiting room for 45 minutes wearing a mask, then decided to take his temperature and refused to see him because it came up at just over 99. This was a few months ago in NC where it was about 100 degrees every single day. They also advised him to social distance from me when he came home just in case, which made both of us laugh hysterically. Smh</p>

        <p>I live in a rural area in NC but our governor is on a power trip and we have a statewide mask mandate that most places are enforcing so they aren’t forcibly shut down again. I’ve heard of a few places that aren’t enforcing it, mostly in a particular county where the Sheriff said he will not shut down businesses based on unconstitutional mandates. I’ve still been too nervous to actually go. Maybe I should see if my husband wants to go to one of the restaurants I read about. The reviews indicate that they aren’t enforcing the mandate, hopefully that’s accurate.</p>

        <p>I am in AZ. Tucson is very pro-mask. Only a few outlier places dont require masks. I saw a lot of masks in Phoenix, but I was only briefly there. The places like Prescott, flagstaff, sonoita....places out in the country or up north are wonderful. If this goes on forever, I wish I could buy a cabin out there.</p>

        <p>My closest city is Raleigh, where we used to live before we bought our house in the country. I can’t even go there anymore; they’re hardcore mask people in that county. My vet is in that county and they require masks in your own car in their parking lot when their employee comes out to get your pet (lobby is completely closed to customers). It’s ridiculous. They also try to take every dog in on a slip lead without their actual collar/harness, but they make an exception for my dogs thankfully as I’m too worried about them getting off the slip lead and running into traffic. A house in the middle of nowhere is ideal if this is our forever situation.</p>

        <p>I'm right there with you.</p>
<p>I avoid going absolutely anywhere unless I have to because I can't breathe with a mask. Technically the Government cannot mandate everyone wearing masks for the rest of our lives. It's unconstitutional. That being said, the government has thrown the constitution in the garbage and no longer care about civil liberties.</p>
<p>There are lawsuits being filed against these mask mandates. It will take time.</p>
<p>Our biggest problem is not the government, it's the sheep.</p>
<p>It's the dumb Face Diaper Zombies.</p>
<p>The more liberal and educated the region, the more obedience you will see from the brainless drones who follow every order coming from .gov like they're being graded.</p>
<p>This only stops when the public makes it stop. It's up to you and me.</p>
<p>After 9/11 they installed the TSA screening nonsense. They never went back to the old normal after that event. </p>
<p>Don't expect the government to pull back any of their mandates or restrictions. They love power too much.</p>
<p>Until we organize and put an end to it, it will never end.</p>

        <p>This isn't about the state, well not directly. In a capitalist system the role of the state is to create and sustain the sets of rules and institutions that form "The market economy". </p>
<p>In the western world, people are beginning to reject globalism and neoliberalism because it has not been good for them and has brought on a decline in standards of living. </p>
<p>This whole covid thing is about trying to stem the tides of populism and regain control, get obedient, low wage workers in a perpetual race to the bottom. </p>

        <p>It is absolutely about beating people down so they can be more easily controlled by the state. That’s obvious when you see people walking alone in parks wearing masks, wearing them in their own cars, and shutting out family/friends.

        <p>I know exactly how you feel OP. I started having panic attacks for the first time in my life a couple months ago and they became a daily thing. It was so horrible I have recently got put on some medication for it. I am not scared of the virus. I am scared of how the world is acting about it. I am tired of see people with masks on everywhere I go instead of people’s faces. I fear that if the wrong person wins the election, this might all last a long time.</p>

        <p>I completely understand. Panic attacks are scary and I’m sorry you’re having to deal with them. I’ve had them for around 20 years on and off. I really don’t know if the election will affect it much in a good or bad way because the draconian mandates are coming from state and local governments, not the federal level, and those draconian mandates are well supported by many brainwashed doomers.</p>

        <p>I feel you,I'm a 18 yo guy with mild asthma,otherwise completely healthy. Wearing a mask more than 30-45 minutes is impossible. If I wear one more than that,I feel dizzy and short of breath for a few hours. Doesn't help when there is a mask mandate everywhere in my country. Always have to watch out for the cops while outside,the fine is like $100.</p>

        <p>We planned to stay at Four Queens on Fremont St because I like the retro vibe. I still want to as I haven’t been to Vegas since 2012 and my husband has never been. The problem is getting out there! Airlines are requiring masks to fly and I can’t do that, especially for a 5-6 hour flight. So we would need at least a couple weeks off work to road trip from NC to Vegas. </p>
<p>Besides, the casinos are requiring masks too according to what I’ve seen on r/Vegas (although there are a lot of doomers over there). I’ve seen accounts of staff harassing people to put their masks up between sips of their drink. I’m not spending my hard earned money to go endure that shit. I’ll shell out the money for real Vegas with no masks, not Diet Vegas.</p>

        <p>Word.  I went with my GF to Caesars palace and we had a blast but this was precovid.</p>
<p>Yeah, in Reno even though the pool was open the staff were gestapo like with masks, even outdoors with 15+ foot "social distance".  More annoying than that was that all hot tubs are gated off (yet still heated for some reason).</p>

        <p>I hear you. This is very close to my situation. It’s a shitty way to live and I’m worried it’s just going to get worse. It makes sense that you’re frustrated this isn’t okay.</p>

        <p>I think there are a lot of people out there just like you. I’m talking like maybe thousands of people who are severely restricting where they go because they can’t breathe or handle wearing a mask. 2020 is the year where people with disabilities don’t matter-they’ve made that real clear. You’ve probably heard this before but have you considered a face shield? I use them regularly and they suck but at least I can breathe with my asthma.</p>

        <p>If I determine that this isn’t going away for a long time, I might try a face shield. For now, going out just isn’t worth it so I’ll stay home. You’re right; this is the year where nobody gives a shit about people with disabilities and it’s messed up. I mean, if a grocery store kicked a customer out for being in a wheelchair and said they only serve people who are walking, they’d get sued so quickly. But you can deny someone the right to buy food if they cannot have their airways cut off with a tight mask. Go figure.</p>

        <p>You should but good luck getting into a grocery store or most anywhere else without one. The businesses are literally kicking people out for not wearing masks and not honoring any exemptions. I guess we’re not worthy of food if we have medical conditions?</p>
