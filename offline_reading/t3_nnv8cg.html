    <strong>Strongly opposed to new normal but favorable toward immunizations ("pro-vax"): here's what it looks like</strong>
    <p><p>Here's what it looks like to be absolutely opposed to the "new normal" but favorable to vaccination.   I believe:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is your body, your choice;</li>
<li>vaccine passports are generally evil;</li>
<li>employers should not be entitled to track your health information (eg covid vax status) unless it is directly associated with the business (eg directly providing healthcare);</li>
<li>life involves risk that needs to be managed, not avoided;</li>
<li>lockdowns and blanket community masking were a terrible response to a pandemic;</li>
<li>people who are afraid should take measures to protect themselves rather than impose their fears on others;</li>
<li>the covid vaccines that are out there right now are not well-tested and it's reasonable to be skeptical right now, even if you are generally favorable to immunizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for those who oppose immunizations generally -- I believe people today esp. in the US have an exaggerated their own immune system's power because they are in fact riding along on "herd immunity" -- because a high percentage are immunized against the real nasties -- so people who choose not to get immunizations are unlikely to be exposed anyway. I'm old enough to remember when virtually all kids got the chicken pox no matter how healthy and natural their lifestyle while adults were dying from complications; when the flu was common and life threatening; and a bunch of adults around us had been crippled by polio. Many older adults are still crippled by shingles complications which are preventable via immunization.</p></p>

<p>More than skeptical, my response is now positively hostile.</p>

        <p>True for polio, exaggeration for chicken pox and flu. Flu is still common, it was maybe a touch more common in the '80s and '90s, and it wasn't a big deal (in fact, people seem MORE afraid of it now, because people are just easier to scare). Remember, flu vaccines have pretty low efficacy - way too low for herd immunity even if literally everyone got them. All they do is reduce your risk of catching it to some degree. And while adults <em>occasionally</em> died from chicken pox complications, very few actually caught it. Most people got it as kids and that was the end of it. Most adults who did dodge it as children and got it later in life survived. For kids the disease is not a big deal. I had it, my sisters had it, it was not fun but nobody was in danger.</p>
<p>Still, thank you for not supporting passports, mandatory vaccines, and loss of medical privacy.</p>
