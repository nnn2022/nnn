    <strong>Current Covid Statistics - Fun Fact Time</strong>
    <p><p>From - https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</p>
<p>By today, there's has been 161,173,711 confirmed covid cases with 3,347,678 deaths which is 2.077%.</p>
<p>It's also currently reported that 139,004,515 have recovered from covid which is 86.245%.</p>
<p>This leaves 18,821,518 people that are currently infected which is 0.239% of the overall world population.</p>
<p>From the current amount of people infected, 18,716,730 are reported to only have mild symptoms which is 99.4% with 104,788 are reported as being in a critical condition which is 0.6%</p>
<p>The population of the world is around 7,874,965,825 which means that right now, 2.04% of the world is infected as I type.</p>
<p>So that means that based on these figures, I have around a 2% chance of catching covid, with an estimated 0.6% chance of being critical, 2% chance of dying and 86% of surviving. </p>
<p>It also means that even if I do get covid, I have an estimated 99% chance of only having mild symptoms and a 0.6% of being critically ill, based on current figures.</p>
<p>You'd think with how deadly everyone pretends covid is, the figures would be the other way around right?</p>
<p>Always go by the numbers. Forget the bullshit.</p>
<p>Also as a side point, in the US, men have a 40% chance of developing cancer and 21% chance of dying from it and woman have a 38% chance of developing cancer and 18% chance of dying from it so people should be far more worried about getting cancer than covid. </p>
<p>Why aren't people out protesting against companies that cause cancer like tobacco companies, pharmaceutical companies, alcohol companies, fast food companies, bullshit diet and nutrition companies, etc. You know why, because they're brainwash into thinking these companies are out to help them.</p>
<p>People have their priorities all fucked up because they don't even understand the basic principles of what actually kills us the most.</p>
<p>Thank fuck I'm not one of them.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing this, it’s really good info. </p>
<p>What’s your opinion on the PCR diagnostic (rapid) tests that clinics use? My understanding is that many steps or metrics are skipped, for the purposes of getting a faster result (due to the large volume of people getting tested), however this would seem disingenuous &amp; dangerous because this could create a plethora of false positive results, thus skewing the actual case vs death counts. And let’s not even forget about those who died with co-morbidities or were already in hospice. Thoughts?</p>

        <p>Was never meant to be used as a diagnostics tool. After so many cycles the tests thing can begin to pick up dead cells or traces of almost any other virus deeming the results extremely inaccurate and in some courts across the world the results have been thrown out due to the inconsistencies.</p>
<p>In other words; complete and utter horseshit that this test has been the “golden child” for health experts to stipulate how we are allowed to live our fucking lives for the past 14+ months.</p>

        <p>As a conspiracy theorist, I will say they are over reported. In France, if there was just ONE covid positive in a nursing home, all following death in this nursing home could be counted as covid, even without tests. They deemed it was "highly probable" that there were indeed covid deaths.</p>
