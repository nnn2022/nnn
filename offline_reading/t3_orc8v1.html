        <p>Sorry, we remove these.  One of the admins from there admitted to banning me without reason after he accused this sub of brigading.</p>
<p>That's the one that gets me...</p>
<p>All of us in this sub are obviously very interested in matters related to coronavirus.  r/coronavirus was at one point even endorsed by Reddit as the primary source if information.  Yet, we can't participate in the discussion because of association with thought criminals?</p>
<p>I myself have to ban so many handles and I very rarely get pleasure from it.  The difference between a sub like this and r/coronavirus is that we have never pretended to be unbiased.  We still get an endless flow if people who reject the premise of the sub who for whatever reason have a sense of entitlement to participate anyways.</p>
<p>It's like somebody who loves Coke going onto a Pepsi sub and telling them they are idiots for preferring Pepsi and then acting surprised when they get banned.</p>
<p>I used to think it's just people fucking with me and it probably mostly is but lately I've been seeing things that point to it being from a lost generation of kids who are basically brain damaged from growing up with social media as the most significant cultural force in their lives.</p>

        <p>I also said in my comments on the post that I was not denying the efficacy of any vaccine. Saying I was banned for anti vaccine nonsense doesn't really add up at all. I sent the mods articles from legit sources to back the information I was sharing. Pfizer has done a lot of horrible things to push their products. Sweep side effects under the rug etc. Which is what I was responding to.</p>

        <p>It would have been good to put what you said but I really don't need convincing myself give. My own experience.  I don't know what happened but that sub had been fine for well over a year until a few months ago when they went all-in on becoming a propaganda too that doesn't even try to hide their bias.</p>
