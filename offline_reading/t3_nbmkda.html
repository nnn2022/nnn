        <p>I do understand some of the arguments against it and used to agree with them. But honestly it is easy to get some form of ID in the UK. </p>
<p>We don't have government ID cards that we're required to carry and I think that's a good thing (we're also not obliged to give the police our identity unless they actually arrest us, even then refusal is a fine while they ID you). We have drivers licenses and passports as well as some other possible ID cards.</p>
<p>If this was to become a thing it'd need to either be free or very cheap and easy to get the ID. And, to be fair, they're already available <a href="https://www.citizencard.com/apply-for-a-uk-id-card-online">cheaply</a> (¬£15 or ¬£30).</p>

        <p>According to <a href="https://www.idea.int/data-tools/region-view/39/40">IDEA northern Europe</a>, which they consider the UK a part of:</p>
<p>Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland all require identification upon voting voting and all have higher voter participation than the UK.</p>
<p>It may have to do with first past the post system but I doubt that explains the 20% percentile difference between Sweden and the UK in parliament elections as Finland has similar participation as the UK in both Presidential and Parliamentary elections with voter ID.</p>

        <p>I think that just shows voter ID requirements aren't necessarily correlated with lower voting percentages. But you probably can't compare countries that easily though, it will be a lot of factors, e.g. your example of our awful first past the post system.</p>

        <p>Yes. But I think it is clear that even if you go to IDEA web site and check other countries in western and northern Europe, voting participation is generally on the same level despite there being very large political differences across the board.</p>

        <p>The issue with voter ID typically isn't that acquiring an ID is inherently problematic, it's that these laws are written in such a way to disenfranchise minority voters. A number of stipulations in these bills tend to written with the intent to disenfranchise black voters. For example, a court ruling found the NC voter ID bill was designed to "target African-Americans with almost surgical precision".</p>

        <p>First of all, I never said red tape stops someone from getting a voter ID.  You said that.  I said getting rid of red tape would make it easier to get one.</p>
<p>In my son‚Äôs case, registering to vote was a huge pain.  He‚Äôs had health issues (migraines and back problems), so he put off getting a driver‚Äôs license until he felt comfortable getting behind the wheel.  Then when we moved to a new state last year his Social Security card got lost.  It took around four to five months of going back and forth with the Social Security office, the DMV (for his state ID), and the county office where he was born (yet another state) for him to get registered to vote.  </p>
<p>So yeah, the amount of bureaucracy and civil servants he had to deal with who really didn‚Äôt give a shit made it a nightmare.  There‚Äôs absolutely no reason why the process has to be that drawn out and cumbersome.</p>

        <p>Huh? You said "red tape". I never made any claim. I asked a question.  </p>
<p>Perhaps taking better care of his Social Security card would have reduced the red tape.  </p>
<p>Isn't a birth certificate adequate ID to get ID that allows you to vote?</p>

        <p>You asked why red tape would stop the process.  I didn‚Äôt say it stopped anything, only that it makes it harder. </p>
<p>In a perfect world, he wouldn‚Äôt have lost his card or his birth certificate.  But shit happens.  And there are a lot of citizens in this country who don‚Äôt have them either. Why should it take nearly half a year for someone to prove their citizenship?   That‚Äôs ridiculous.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs not the fuck ups that are the problem.  There are a lot of citizens in this country who do not need a driver‚Äôs license, birth certificate, or social security card to live their daily lives.  And since getting them is a huge hassle and unnecessary, many people don‚Äôt have them.  As a result they are punished by not being able to vote.  So why not make the process easier to prove you are a citizen?  Seems like we should be able to do that while still protecting sufficiently against fraud.  </p>
<p>As for my son, it‚Äôs the chicken and the egg.  Every agency wants proof of identity.  So how do you get one form of ID without the others?  It can be done, but the process is not straightforward.  There‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúyou have to do step A before step B‚Äù.  But because they are all different agencies at different levels of government (SSA is federal, license is state, birth certificate is county), there‚Äôs no coordination at all.</p>

        <p>The easiest way I can think of is improve coordination among levels of government.  I doubt it will happen because there are too many people who bristle at just about any form of centralization as an assault on their freedom.  </p>
<p>There are still a lot of places in the US where you don‚Äôt need an ID to get by.  Not everyone needs a bank account, rooms can be rented without ID in many low income urban areas, and as long as your paying for the car an insurance, you can get it registered by someone else.</p>

        <p>The funny part is that even with literally all red tape removed, making it completely free, etc. democrats still bitch, because they seem to genuinely think black people are either too stupid or lazy to get themselves to the nearest DMV to get a free ID that they only have to show up for and maybe a SS number, or current picture ID/drivers license to prove your identity. Even those laws get challenged by democrats on the grounds that it "disproportionately harms black people"</p>

        <p>Picture meant to emphasize the hypocrisy. People oppose voter ID (which are free btw), because underprivileged minorities allegedly not able to get one. Shouldn‚Äôt the same logic be applicable to vaccination passports? Of course you can flip the image and it will reflect the believes of the opposite group, but that group have different reasonings behind both statements, so what‚Äôs the point?</p>

<p>If you think there should be both or neither, then you're free of hypocrisy.</p>

        <p>You're making a good point.<br>
However, it falls short of success. The equivalent would be requiring people to vote if they are allowed to go to a restaurant, get on a plane, go to work, or whatever else.<br>
The voter ID is there to make sure an election in on the up-and-up.<br>
The vaccine passport is there to mau mau people into allowing the injection of a experimental vaccine that is not FDA approved.</p>

<p>No it is not, if your beliefs are not contradicting each other in both cases. Like, if you claim that voter ID is ‚Äúracist‚Äù, then you are a hypocrite for demanding vaccination passport because it contradicts this claim. But if you favor voter ID because of election integrity, then it has nothing to do with vaccine passports and there‚Äôs no contradiction, so where is the hypocrisy in this case?</p>

        <p>Securing political elections is not the same as forcing every one to take an experimental vaccine that hasn't been fda approved. Not to mention a vaccine for a virus that affects less than 1% of the population. While our elections affect every single person in this country.</p>

        <p>The vaccines have been FDA approved.  That was the whole point behind Trump‚Äôs Operation Warp Speed - the steps in the approval process that are usually done in series were done in parallel.  There‚Äôs a lot of financial risk in that, because it‚Äôs expensive to do all the testing steps simultaneously.  If any one of the steps failed, the vaccines wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to go forward.  But the government guaranteed the money so that the risk was on the government, not the companies that developed the vaccine.  </p>
<p>So, yeah, it‚Äôs been approved by the same process as other vaccines, but Trump cut through the red tape.  Don‚Äôt like it?  Go complain to Trump.</p>

        <p>It does hurt things. 10ish% of the population doesn't have ID. More in minority groups. And getting ID isn't always as easy as pulling up to the DMV and going to the counter. There are many many studies on this. Voter ID laws are pushed to enact voter suppression in order to win elections. It's not about voter fraud.</p>

        <p>What? Not always. A state university is going to know who you are. Those aren't valid. The people who wrote the voter ID laws aren't going to benefit from students because they aren't their voting demographic. That's what voter ID is about.

        <p>It's free in some states but not all. But unfortunately it's not as simple as I typed in this dumb thread. There's many many more roadblocks put up that restrict people from voting. Ohers that allow people to vote, which are favored towards certain groups, like letting people vote with concealed carry permits but not student IDs which favors mostly older, richer, white people. They say it's about voter fraud. It's not. Voter fraud isn't an issue. It's about voter suppression and anyone honestly looking at it can see that.</p>

        <p>Seriously, I don‚Äôt understand this. If voter fraud is not an issue, then there‚Äôs no reason to oppose voter ID requirement. On the contrary, party that claims there was no fraud should be interested in establishing voter ID to close this debate once and for all, no?

        <p>I believe you have it backwards? If voter fraud is an issue, why does voter id matter? Voter id is there to solve the problem of voter fraud.</p>
<p>I don't think people would have an issue with voter id if there was a way to get IDs to everyone. But it's not that easy. But that's not even the point. They voter id issue is not about voter fraud. It's about voter suppression. If it really WAS about voter fraud, funding would go into providing people the means to acquiring ID. But it won't be funded. Because again, it's not about that. The people pushing voter id are not going to get votes from the people who struggle to get the IDs. That's why they don't want them voting.</p>

        <p>&rt; If voter fraud is an issue, why does voter id matter?</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think I understand the question. Voter ID matters to have a strong claim that only citizens of voting age are participating. </p>
<p>Also getting ID is super fucking easy. I‚Äôm an immigrant and I had to go through a few more steps than citizen would, and even then I cannot even remotely complain. Getting ID in my home country is still more complex, just because the damn processing center is in the middle of nowhere and only opened like 4 hours a week. In US DMVs are everywhere, non-driver ID is free (in case of Georgia). I don‚Äôt know what funding you have in mind to smooth it out even further, except home delivery by limo maybe, it is already as easy as can be. The argument that ID acquisition is a barrier of any sort is just bullshit.</p>

        <p>Sorry I'm typing on my phone and I mistyped. I meant to type, if voter fraud ISN'T an issue, why does voter ID matter. Is trying to get at my larger point of it not being about fraud. </p>
<p>I encourage you to read the many many articles written on voter id suppression and the hurdles that come from it. In some cases, yes, having the ID mailed to someone, like an elderly person who can't leave the house to go to a government building to get the ID, WOULD help. But there are lots and lots of studies on this out there that flesh out many more issues on this.</p>
<p>But let's even ignore all of that. The core issue is that some politicians (read: most republicans in southern districts with large minority populations) don't want those people voting because they aren't voting for them. They don't need to stop all of them, these races are usually pretty close. They only need to stop a few. And if they stop 1000 people from voting because they couldn't take off work and spend the money to get a state issued ID, that might be all they need to win their election. It's anti democratic and it's dirty tricks that they use.</p>

        <p>I understand your point, it is just something I fundamentally disagree with, based on both personal experience and world standards. I personally want voter ID just so I could have confidence, and also to shut debates like this one for good. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúdirty trick‚Äù in getting ID in US either (I do agree it should be free everywhere, it is already free where I live) - you show up in any DMV in your state in any convenient day and they hand it to you for free. If someone feels it to be a barrier of some sort, then in my opinion he shouldn‚Äôt be voting in the first place.</p>

<p>I would also be for voter ID if it solved a problem. But it doesn't. It's a ploy to get people not to vote. In a country that regularly says voting is the core value we have. If there was more evidence of voter fraud, I would change my opinion and I think others would too. I'd also promote ways to get ID to people so they could have the access to vote. But most of the same people also are against that, like mail in voting, largely for the same reasons. They don't want those people to vote because those people aren't voting for them.</p>

<p>Too bad for him. To paraphrase creepy Joe, no right is absolute. Someone will not be able to vote so the rest of us could maintain the integrity of voting process, this is just the reality. I‚Äôm pretty sure the amount of people who are physically unable to obtain the ID is statistically insignificant. </p>

<p>This is not how I see it. ID requirement is not a barrier.
I personally believe the voter ID is crucial to maintain confidence in voting results. Also, it is my personal opinion on this matter, and not a general argument, but I believe that if someone doesn‚Äôt care about getting the ID, even though the process is as easy as it can be and the ID itself is free, then I do not care about his vote being lost. That‚Äôs just the sacrifice I‚Äôm willing to make in order for the rest of us to be confident in the process.</p>

        <p>You can see it that way, and I can empathize with it. On a blank slate it seems very rational for require ID. But I'm telling you the politicians pushing it do NOT see it this way. They see it as a way to turn away votes. My belief is that is wrong. I'd they actually cared at voting rights and protecting them, they would push things akin to mail in voting, getting IDs to people. They just don't give a shit. </p>
<p>And I understand that you do. I also do to an extent. But why do you think they allow gun permits as ID, but not school IDs as ID?</p>

        <p>This is a stupid argument. Gun permits require actual verification of the individual as a US citizen. Student IDs do not. My wife is a Chinese citizen and she got a student ID no problem. Should she be voting in US elections? I don‚Äôt think so and neither does she.</p>
<p>If you really want to have schools deputized to make the distinction on their student IDs because they go through proper verification of some to confirm they are US citizens, then I suppose that is an argument to make, but realistically this is just a red herring argument designed to derail the conversation. Just think about why people claim the need for affirmative action, if their claim is valid, then that means minorities are also disproportionately likely to have student ID, so allowing them would also disproportionately hurt minorities.</p>

        <p>To keep it blunt, it's to keep people who aren't in their voting demo from voting. The politicians pushing these laws are mostly in southern states with large minority populations. That vote isn't going to them. Students aren't their demo. Poor minorities aren't their demo. The more people in those groups they can dissuade from voting, the better chance they have of winning their election. </p>
<p>You still have to register to vote. The ID is just to prove to the person at the poll that you are who you say you are. The ID is NOT to prove that you are a citizen. The school ID fulfills that. </p>
<p>Voter fraud doesn't happen. There was 31 cases that have happened between 2000-14. That's in person voter fraud. Which is what I'd targeted by voter ID laws. Mail in voting and related fraud is not counted in this since you don't have to show an ID. 31. And a lot of those were simple errors not intended to be fraud. Voter ID laws are bullshit intended to suppress voting.</p>

        <p>How would you ever be able to provide evidence of fraud when you‚Äôre not allowed to ID people or do signature verification?</p>
<p>Why wouldn‚Äôt you use this same standard to give the benefit of the doubt to people instead of crafting a conspiracy theory about voter suppression? How many cases of voter suppression because someone doesn‚Äôt have a valid ID have been proven between 2000-14? If you already need to prove you‚Äôre a citizen before, then the argument that voter ID is suppression is actually incorrect because IDs in all of those states are free. It is the very act of requiring that those people prove they are a citizen that is actually burdensome to minorities and the true form of voter suppression in these cases. Therefore we shouldn‚Äôt be concerned with the ID requirement, but rather the burdensome proof of citizenship requirement, correct?</p>

        <p>You can see the suppression by looking at voter turn out before and after voter ID laws went into place. There's studies fine that show the decline after the laws. I'd Google it but I'm honestly a bit tired because I've been talking to people on here for the last few hours about similar things. But it's been measured. </p>
<p>And to speak to you personal self. You think these laws are there and being pushed in total honesty? When they target the exact demos they hope to suppress? While not then touching mail in voting? About an issue that doesn't even really exist.</p>
<p>Why isn't there proposals for funding to get people IDs if it was this crucial to election security? There are people in rural communities who don't own a car and are very far away from government buildings issuing the IDs. Shouldn't we be providing solutions to get everyone in America an ID? We aren't proposing that. It's not about that! It's about them not voting, because those people aren't voting for the people pushing the laws.</p>

        <p>How do you know voter turnout didn‚Äôt decrease as a result of the voter ID law doing its exact proposed purpose of preventing ineligible voters from voting? It seems to me it would actually be evidence that voter ID matters.</p>
<p>I think those voter ID laws are being pushed for one very very simple reason, to suppress voter turnout in the illegal immigrant community, a group of people that do not have the right to vote, and do vote disproportionately high for Democrat candidates. I think it has absolutely nothing to do with any minorities that are US citizens.</p>
<p>There are proposals for funding to get people IDs, it was already been funded in states that require it, that is why they are free there. Rural people vote for Republicans more often, so they get neglected in all of this with their more limited access to travel to a location that can issue an ID, however, since Republicans generally propose these laws they are seen as a causality in it all because it isn‚Äôt politically expedient for Democrats to preach about their rights at the same time. Honestly, I think regardless of who you are there should be a cost to voting. If you are not willing to pay that cost, then you really don‚Äôt have a strong enough opinion to vote. Every action anyone makes always has an opportunity cost, even taking a piss, how often are you going to do it because you want to drink more water to stay hydrated because hydration easily outweighs the negatives of pissing an extra 5 times a day.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it seems you did nothing to explain why the voter ID laws cause suppression, but are rather simply being used in conjunction with proof of citizenship to cause the suppression of non-citizen votes, which is literally the stated goal of Republicans and seems to be the direct consequence of these types of laws. To suggest anything to the contrary without evidence seems like a conspiracy theory to me.</p>

        <p>You think voter turn out going down is evidence of voter fraud being reduced? What? What evidence? It doesn't make sense to you that when you require people to bring multiple forms and other sorts of hoops, that there won't be a % of people that get frustrated and say "screw this"? That not more likely to you? If there was massive in person fraud, wouldn't we hear about it? If you went to a polling place and you were marked as already voted, you wouldn't raise an issue? That's fraud but we don't see it. I'm not understanding your logic here.</p>
<p>Non citizens can't vote in federal elections. They CAN in some states for local elections. But that's usually not what is focused on when talking about illegals voting. Trump claiming it is not proof. You have to show evidence of illegals voting. But there is none that I can find. But if you have a link I'll read it.</p>
<p>Voting used to have a cost. It was called a poll tax. In the 60s, they added an amendment to make it unconstitutional. You can advocate for a poll tax, but you'll have to change the constitution to do it. This is one of the arguments against voter ID. It's a hidden poll tax in the form of buying ID or having to aquire it through other means. I'd rather let people have their right to vote and not try to restrict it, whether it's a democrat or republican. This shouldn't be a partisan issue.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm not advocating a poll tax, I‚Äôm saying every cost you are complaining about is an opportunity cost. It is okay if voting requires opportunity cost.</p>
<p>I am also saying you have no proof it is suppressing legitimate votes instead of illegitimate votes. Do you really think that illegal immigrants wouldn‚Äôt vote in an election if they know they will not be IDed? See how that logic is the same logic you are using with regard to people being lazy? The important thing is that anyone being too lazy to vote is already an excuse for why people don‚Äôt vote and all they have to do is be less lazy and it will solve the problem. There is no other recourse to stop illegal immigrants from voting.</p>
<p>So basically we have one problem that requires self-responsibility and one problem that can only be solved this way. This shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue, there is a reason voter ID is required all around the world, just not the US. Perhaps you are saying the US is the least racist country and all of those other countries are much more racist though, would that be an accurate characterization?</p>

        <p>Illegal immigrants can't vote. You have to register to vote. During the registration process is when proof of citizenship comes up. If you weren't registered, you can't show up to a polling place and cast a vote. Do you think there are illegals showing up to polling places and voting for other people? Why? Where? If it's happening then yeah, I'd want to stop it also. But it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>But you ARE saying it happens. And the evidence is voter turn out going down because now they can't do that without an ID. Am I following? I'm not trying to be an ass, I'm trying to follow along</p>

        <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Bob Smith and I‚Äôm here to vote. I only speak Spanish, are you going to tell me I‚Äôm not Bob Smith?</p>
<p>Then later in the day the real Bob Smith comes in to vote and guess what? He already voted!</p>
<p>How could we ever actually prove that it wasn‚Äôt him that voted? We are not allowed to have surveillance in those places for privacy reasons, which I completely agree with. Likewise that is the point of secret ballots and how they get separated from the names immediately after registering. This means you have to confirm it at that time or it would be impossible to ever prove someone voted illegally.</p>
<p>The only other logical explanation for why there are issues with names already being marked are if the names are too similar, but that too would be solved with the IDs. Anyone that loses their vote has been suppressed by the other person who stole their vote. Even if a provisional ballot does get upheld, it still results in an extra vote having been cast.</p>
<p>Honestly, it doesn‚Äôt have to be illegal immigrants either, I could just drive to 10 different places near where I live and vote at all of them if I have information on names of people who live there.</p>
<p>The point is to make sure that the person that shows up to vote is the person registered as well. Obviously different states have different laws so the nuisances of same day registration, vs registering earlier and proving citizenship all of minor differences and I think it‚Äôs too complicated to go into each scenario. My point is the overarching issue where people are constantly being told they already voted when the claim to have not. There is no reason to believe they are lying, especially since if they do manage to vote twice for real and that ends up being provable, they would really be in trouble and by going public they are drawing attention to their case.</p>

<p>It just doesn't happen though. We would hear about it. We don't. It's not a thing. This is the issue that voter id is supposed to protect but it doesn't happen. There no point to voter id. Except for the suppression I've already talked about for far too long on this thread.</p>

        <p>How is it voter suppression when everybody already has ID? You need one in order to work, get an apartment or buy a house, buy drugs and liquor, to get certain prescriptions, collect government services like food stamps, wic, or welfare, cash in checks,  see R rates movies,  go to a bar, or gamble. The only person this would describe is somebody living in the mountains who lives completely off the land. How many people are doing that?</p>

        <p>Voting is supposed to be core to American democracy. It's supposed to the the most foundational right. Buying alcohol or seeing movies aren't. It's suppression by putting unnecessary roadblocks to voting. By putting them up, voter turn out will go down. Which is exactly the intended goal.</p>

        <p>Being able to work to provide for your family and having a home to live in is also a human  right but you still need Id for those things. So voter id can't be a roadblock if everybody already has id and can't function in society without one.</p>

The ones pushing the laws don't benefit from the people they are targeting with voter ID. It's a way to win elections, not protect them.</p>

        <p>I didn't mention PA. I googled a link and that was the first to come up. It had a list I skimmed through that had ID costs by state. A quick Google search of CA says that you can get a reduced fee if you qualify as lower income. Not free. Or free if you are homeless and have access to a homeless shelter. You also need to get, fill out, and bring additional forms with you in order to qualify. You are free to Google to policies of other states. I provided you 2 links already.</p>

        <p>Dude I just googled the state I'm in to see their fees for IDs. That's what I found for California. I know CA doesn't require ID. I'm not searching every state and providing you that info. Those links don't prove me wrong, I'm not even sure what we are trying to argue here. I didn't know this was going to turn into a debate. My stance is that voter id is voter suppression.

        <p>Dude. You said this:</p>
<p>&rt;    &rt;    It's free in some states but not all.</p>
<p>Which states? It‚Äôs really simple. If you made a statement I‚Äôd assume you knew what you were talking about. So which states?</p>

        <p>Holy fuck. You asked me which states have free ID and which don't. I said CA. I know they don't have ID laws. I already said this. </p>
<p>&rt;It's free in some states but not all</p>
<p>IT'S NOT FREE IN CA. I answered your fucking question. There are others. No I'm not looking. It's also not as simple as a flat fee when you pick it up. There's hidden costs to "free IDs" but after these responses from you, I really don't expect you to grasp that.</p>

        <p>Hahaha dude just take the L.</p>
<p>You were trying to make up shit and got called out unless you just happened to be randomly talking about the cost of ID in states that don‚Äôt require voter ID in a thread about voter ID. Why on Earth would anyone be asking you about the cost of ID in random states in this thread lol?</p>
<p>Bottom line: you were obviously trying to make an argument that states that require ID to vote DO NOT offer a free ID or a free alternative to fuel your argument that requiring a legal voter to proved they are who they say they are is somehow wrong. There are no states that require ID that do not offer a free ID or alternative.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs nothing else to discuss here, don‚Äôt bother replying as I won‚Äôt read it unless you can provide me with a state that requires ID to vote and provides no free alternative. Something tells me the way you‚Äôve been arguing all over this thread that you‚Äôre the kind of person who needs to get the last word in so go off lol. </p>
<p>TL;DR: States which require ID provide it or a free alternative in order to vote. This eliminates a common liberal / CNN / MSNBC etc. talking point and pisses off people who want illegals to vote.</p>

        <p>Seriously though. You really think it's about voter fraud? There's been no substantial evidence for voter fraud in the country. And then politicians that push the voter id laws are almost always in districts that would benefit from stopping poor minorities from voting, since they would not be voting for the republican. You don't think there is any other angle there? Those politicians just want to stop voter fraud and it's not at all about trying to stop those people from voting so that they have a better chance at winning?</p>
