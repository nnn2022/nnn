    <strong>Are we being reconditioned to accept the New Normal? (UN Agenda 30/Great Reset)</strong>
    <p><p>SS: We are being reconditioned to give up more of our rights (by those that caused the current failure of our economic systems in the first place, rich really) in the name of less consumerism and to foresee the implementation of Agenda 30.</p>
<p>Think about it, for an intelligent species, humans are very easily manipulated. If the elites can enforce this much change to our daily lives in less than 1 year, what could they do in 10.</p>
<p>Personally, and it may be an unpopular opinion here but just a thought, there seems to be a huge global push in relation to climate change presently. It seems to be a particular motive for the Agenda 2030 initiative. Maybe the elites know something we don't. Maybe climate change has reached the point to which if we do not take drastic action, it will have profound effects on humanity and its survival. Hence, these radical implementations?</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum is pushing for stakeholder capitalism. An extremely technocratic system.</p>

<p>Noticed, all 4 of these people use the COVID 19 pandemic as a "great opportunity" to reset our way of lifes. Build Back Better is a slogan used by both Joe Biden and the Prime Minister of the UK.</p>
<p><strong>BUT the NY Times calls this a baseless conspiracy:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/17/world/covid-19-coronavirus#the-baseless-great-reset-conspiracy-theory-rises-again">https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/11/17/world/covid-19-coronavirus#the-baseless-great-reset-conspiracy-theory-rises-again</a></p>
<p>Which just goes to show that "conspiracy theory" is just a psychological buzz word. The masses see that word, the context of anything goes out of the window.</p>
<p>Problem is, with the Great Reset and the UN's Agenda 30, it sounds like a great Utopia where everyone is equal, everyone has access to just the things they need BUT you still have the same people running the show, we don't get a say and we are expected to accept less in our lives whilst the top 1 percent eat the small piece of pie you've just given up.</p>

        <p>I dont believe in some of the "great reset" things like social credit and vaccination passports. However I do think this is a push for a much bigger government overreach such as UBI and, at least in the US, socialized healthcare.</p>
<p>Both which can down the road lead to full on socialism</p>

        <p>Can I ask why you don't believe in some of the aspects of the reset you mentioned? They might not get it, but it's been clearly stated that's part of the goal and corporations have already started the passport rollouts(tickmaster being one).</p>

        <p>They are actively planning vaccination passports in the UK and aren't even hiding it anymore. There's no way anyone could deny it.</p>
