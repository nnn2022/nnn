        <p>If the virus will always mutate, doesn’t it make sense that the more it is allowed to spread and multiply the more mutations there will be?  With a higher number of mutations, doesn’t the risk increase of a mutation increasing the infectivity or the ability to avoid vaccine-related antigens?  Those are both traits that would be evolutionarily selected for, and would be anticipated to become dominant, at least in the current environment or reduced restrictions. We’ve already seen more infectious variants become dominant. </p>
<p>I ask because your comment seems to sell this ad fear-mongering, or a reason to not get vaccinated. Controlling the spread through distancing, masks, and vaccination necessarily reduces the number off situated strains that will arise, though. </p>
<p>I don’t know how this is anything other than fact-based science.</p>

        <p>No reason… except that they don’t?  Do you have any evidence of pre-Covid antigens with specificity towards SARS-COV2 being common?  </p>
<p>It is my understanding, and that of most of the field of immunology, that variants of a strain can mean that antigens lose specificity, and certainly reactivity of antigens across strains wouldn’t be anticipated.</p>

        <p>Yes, they are binding to SARS-CoV2, and apparently, to the variants. If people develop antibodies after getting SARS-CoV2, then that already shows that the original spike protein is noticed by the lymphocytes, creating the antibodies. Why would it not notice variants? </p>
<p>If all the major news media are reporting that the vaccines are effective against the variants, that can only mean that with just the original spike protein expressed from the vaccine, it is enough for the immune system to identify <br>
and deal with variants. I'm sure antigens can lose specificity, but so far, the MSM is touting it's not and pushing the vaccines harder than ever as being effective against the variants.</p>

        <p>I didn’t say that the vaccination isn’t effective against variants. I said that that was one of the risk of variants. I also asked specifically about antibody cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses… are past coronaviruses detecting SARS-COV2?</p>

        <p>My point was that our innate immune system is very capable of binding to viruses and their variants. The idea of variants being an alarming danger seems to be minimal (and imo, a media scare tactic) since according to all the authorities, the vaccines are effective against all known variants and the recovery rate is 99.75% for those with natural infection, showing our innate immune system is doing a great job. </p>
<p>I wasn't trying to say that past coronavirus antibodies detect SARS-CoV2 as a result of detecting SARS-CoV or other coronaviruses, but that our immune system on its own, regardless of what virus exposure it's had can detect and bind the novel coronavirus just as it has with all others.</p>

        <p>The immune is capable of recognizing variants, provided the variations don’t change the antigen target too much. </p>
<p>To make that argument with respect to SARS-COV2 and past coronaviruses, absent any evidence of such cross-reactivity and after the publication of mountains of research, is a curious thing to do. </p>
<p>If you weren’t arguing antigen cross-reactivity from past coronavirus infections, what relevance was there in you bringing it up at all?</p>

        <p>The relevance is that fearing the unknown and making major life choices on unknown variables and potential futures is fruitless. Don't give in to fear, which the MSM loves to do because fear sells. </p>
<p>Like I said prior, my point was that our immune system is strong and very capable of handling variants. SARS-CoV2 is not the worst virus ever that we've encountered. Whatever argument you think I'm implying is simply not my point.</p>

        <p>A significant part of my job is in assessing the risks associated with potential failure modes in pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. </p>
<p>There is a significant gap between rational statistical risk assessment and and intuitive risk assessment. Our brains are equipped to react to certain risks and dangers much more aggressively than others, and the rigor of a formalized risk assessment are often counter-intuitive. </p>
<p>The elements of a formal risk assessment of “failure”, i.e. something “bad” happening generally include weighing of factors such as:</p>
<p>-the likelihood of the bad thing happening 
-the likelihood of various consequences of that bad thing happening 
-the “cost” associated with each of those outcomes
-the “cost” associated with mitigating the risk, either by lowering its likelihood or the likelihood of the worst consequences.  </p>
<p>A formal risk assessment looks to balance the costs associated with the risks, accounting for their likelihood, with the costs of risk mitigations. In pharmaceutical manufacturing, there are a lot of very rare but incredibly costly (patent deaths, lawsuits) failure modes, and even more likely failure modes that may have significant costs even if less costly (recall). There is a synergy between process design, process control, quality systems, testing and monitoring that make up “Quality by Design” which seeks to mitigate risks identified through formalized risk assessments. </p>
<p>Let’s take an intuitive example. A person wants to hike through the woods. They are not an experienced hiker. The want to enjoy themselves, and not enjoying themselves would be an outcome they want to minimize. </p>
<p>They know that bears are common in the area, so they buy a can of bear repellent for $10. They go on the hime and get a blister halfway through, making for a miserable conclusion to the hike and to the day. </p>
<p>They had assessed a risk associated with a bear encounter. Human intuition may know it is rare, even where bears are common, but is inclined to overestimate that risk. Humans are also likely to overestimate the risk of a bad outcome, like being killed by the bear, vs the bear running off. The risks of being attacked and killed by a bear are readily calculable, and vanishingly rare. No one is likely to seek out such data in their intuitive assessment. Yet the cost of such an outcome, death, along with the “intuitive” inflated risks, led to investment into a risk mitigation: a $10 can of bear repellent. </p>
<p>Their lack of hiking experience led them to not consider a much more likely “bad” thing: blisters. The cost of a $5 pack of moleskin to manage a blister, or even the “cost” associated with breaking in your hiking boots are cheaper than the investment into risk mitigation made for the bear threat. The chance of a blister is several magnitudes higher, and a rational risk assessment would have found blister risk mitigation’s much more worthwhile. </p>
<p>I’ll apply this to Covid in the next reply.</p>

        <p>some people just don’t care about the virus at all too much since it’s extremely low overall mortality (well below 1%).</p>
<p>All you said regarding possible mutations is true for the flu (influenza) virus too. We can’t predict how it will mutate, it might become more contagious, it might not. We just live with it. </p>
<p>But we would never abandon all our freedom and our civil rights, enact a dystopian autocracy requiring you to provide a vaccination passport or constant mandatory masking because the flu virus might mutate.</p>

        <p>The mutation of influenza tends to result in strains that are orders of magnitude less deadly than Covid. It is also much more contagious, and would be difficult to contain. Regardless, there are times where influenza vaccination is required, such as with healthcare workers. </p>
<p>What “mandatory vaccine passports” are you referring to?  The only legitimate references, as opposed to anti-vax fear-mongering, I’ve heard of them was as a voluntary way to more easily present vaccinations status to private businesses who are requiring vaccine proof. Cruise lines are going to start skipping FL ports because of the state’s ban on vaccine proof. </p>
<p>Where do you find an estimate of population IFR for Covid that is well below 1%?  The papers I’ve found have all had estimates over 1%.</p>

        <p>I don’t know with respect to which point you’re making a reference to an “old paper from John Hopkins”. It seems that an early prediction of millions of casualties was a solid prediction. What case were you making?</p>

        <p>An infection fatality rate of 0.05% would mean that if every person in the US got Covid, there would only be around 165,000 deaths. That clearly can’t be right.</p>

        <p>So the proof of the mortality rate is that a predictive paper that assumed that rate produced death rates similar to what we’ve experienced?  Surely there were other assumptions underlying that predictive model; do those match what occurred since the paper’s publication?  Do you have a link to it?</p>
<p>In any case, it seems that papers calculating the rate from actual data about cases and deaths would sure be more accurate, no?</p>
