    <strong>IMPORTANT CALL TO ACTION FOR #CANCELCOVIDCOLORADO</strong>
    <p><p>I'd like to take a moment to discuss the coronavirus.</p>
<p>I'm not here to debate the existence of the coronavirus, or any other sickness for that matter. I am not in a position to try and comprehend anything that is beyond my personal realm of tangible reality that I can visibly see in front of me.</p>
<p>The year of 2020 and all it's insane "normalities" that we've seen unfold right in front of our eyes aren't something we should just sweep under the rug.</p>
<p>The most dangerous new expression is  the ever-so-popular "Well, I guess _____ is the new normal!" I have heard people using the phrase in too many weird situations that in NO WAY bare any resemblance to what N O R M A L should ever mean.</p>
<p>For the vast majority of human history, was it normal to be so plugged in to a worldwide network of online (dis) information? So that strangers from all over the world could tell you how to live your life because they are the all-knowing HOLY GRAIL of knowledge and wisdom on how to live YOUR life?</p>
<p>Does it feel normal to you being bashed over the head day-in and day-out by the neverending stream of contradicting "statistics" and virtue signaling? Do you not see that they're currently digging your grave?</p>
<p>I recently took a trip out to Wyoming, and OH MY GOD was it refreshing to look people in the face at gas stations, stores and restaurants. It really opened my eyes to how much the mask-wearing has such impacted my mind's expectations. </p>
<p>I practically felt NAKED to be walking around the hotel I was staying in, and had to snap myself out of it! That's extremely frightening and if you're not worried yet, please tell me how it's possible not to be?</p>
<p>How scary is it that something that none of us would have EVER considered a "normal" thing to do, suddenly feelblike the thing we think we are SUPPOSED to be doing?...</p>
<p>The worst part is that the normalization of wearing non-normal face masks in an entire society makes non-compliance a perceived threat. Which is mind-blowing to me. If someone was to come up to you in the year 2019 with a facemask on or a bandana wrapped around their face, you would immediately perceive them as a potential threat and react accordingly...</p>
<p>Now, not wearing those things makes you look like a threat in the eyes of so many brainwashed people?... Truly a shocking phenomenon here, peopls... Please try and spread the word of this group, and invite your free-thinking and patriotic friends and tell them to do the same!</p>
<p>They all continue to say just how HORRIBLE this virus is, but someone I know recently said this:</p>
<p>"Everyone is all worked up, paranoid and wearing a mask but I don't see any sick people! I wouldn't have known about the virus if you hadn't told me about it." I felt like that put it perfectly. For me, it still has not yet reached the realm of my immediate noticable reality.</p>
<p>The people who I've known that have tested positive for it, (myself included) have had nothing but laughably mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all.</p>
<p>The way that a society I have lived, worked and happily participated in has changed recently and this is shockingly significant. As it stands now, the direction of this change is quite frankly pretty damn frightening.</p>
<p>DO   N O T   bend the knee to the commies, my friends. Soon when this group grows just a bit more, I will schedule our first #cancelcovidcolorado peaceful mask-less protest.</p>
<p>I look forward to connecting with you all more in the future, until then, stay strong and stay MAD!!!</p></p>

        <p>Nice, I’m also residing in Denver and I’d be happy to support that protest. </p>
<p>Thankfully, at least those I work with, aren’t taking it too seriously. No masks at work unless involved with customers.</p>
<p>That being said, our state is very democratic, so there’s a lot of ignorance here. </p>
<p>Let’s make the difference.</p>
