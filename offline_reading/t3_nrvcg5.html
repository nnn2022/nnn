    <strong>Ontarian here, went to a flea market with no mask today.</strong>
    <p><p>I am 19 almost 20, and let's just say i live in Southern Ontario, which is perhaps the worst possible place to live in all North America. I went to a flea market with a friend today and when i walked in, i could see the fine folks working there, were either not wearing masks, or had them under their chin. My friend and i immediately removed our muzzles and spent a good two hours walking around, it was such a happy, freeing feeling and not one soul said a word to us. We made sure to give them our business.</p>
<p>I'm starting to get the impression that the mask mandate will never end in Ontario, so we have to end it ourselves. I'm still a little nervous to try this in larger stores, so i've been testing the waters with small businesses, especially those in more rural areas where people are more likely to see through the bullshit.</p>
<p>If i'm out on a summer road trip in the country, and actually enjoy life, and want to stop to get a drink or ice cream, i'm not wearing a fucking mask when i walk in. That's the point, they want the propaganda everywhere 24/7, to saturate every aspect of life (even the joys of life) so there is no escape, so that the population is beaten down and conditioned enough to beg for their new normal, that people will believe allows them even the slightest (perceived) relief from this hellscape that we've been forced into for the past 15 months of our lives and counting, without realizing just how deep they've just been fucked in the ass.</p>
<p>You must resist at all costs. If the people running the business give you shit for it, leave, vote with your wallet.</p></p>

        <p>They can't do anything. Don't wear a mask, if they ask, say your exempted and it's illegal for them to ask your private medical info. They can't do shi.</p>
<p>I confidently walk with pride, with no mask on and literally dgaf. Of course I get the stares and hate from the quad masking doomers, and I love it. But a lot of genuine respect aswell.</p>

        <p>I don't know how bad your police are in Canada, but here in Ireland, they've completely ignored exemptions and arrested people anyway. There are also many companies saying they no longer accept exemptions.</p>

        <p>I'm worried this might happen in Canada too. Here masks in stores are almost 100 percent normal. I've seen one person inside without a mask. I like OP have decided to stop wearing it. So far so good nobody has said anything to me . I'm truly hoping I soon start to see other people but if it get too common they might start cracking down. Who knows. Check this video out. Do you know if ivermectin is available in Ireland. This video is long but very interesting and potentially life saving to watch. It's hard to face that this is  happening in our countries and even harder to face the fact that too many people just CAN'T see it. This mask bs is a similar situation to the gold stars. Dirty bastards!. Peace from over here in Canada.  Say hi to Mrs. Brown and her boys. ðŸ¤£</p>

        <p>I am in Ontario and I never wear a mask. Read the mask mandates, both the provincial one and your municipal bylaw. Carry them on your phone. They all have medical exemptions and it is illegal for the store to:
a) Ask for proof of your medical exemption, since medical data is private and not even the police have a right to see it.
b) Discriminate and refuse you access to the premises for not wearing a mask.
Literally no store or person has ever given me issues. Just look whoever it is in the eye and say I have an exemption and keep walking past them. There is literally nothing they can do. If they call the cops, refuse to divulge private medical data. If the cops are unhinged and arrest you, say nothing, film everything, get a lawyer and sue both the cops and the store. Easy money.</p>

        <p>If they ask you to leave, just leave. Usually you get a positive reaction from people though. I got thanked from some old guy picking up lunch for not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Good for you man. I also live here.  Most people are psychotic about the masks. Iâ€™m getting sick of the medical exemption conversation every time I go into a store.</p>

        <p>...Yeah I live in southern Ontario as well. I wonâ€™t be wearing a mask anymore. If anyone tells me anything Iâ€™ll simply refer Fauciâ€™s email leak. Fauci stated in his emails that the masks do not work. Neither do stay at home orders. Enough is enough.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ve since move to Florida, but when I was in Ontario I never wore a mask once. Everywhere I went I just told them I was exempt. Most places were fine with that. I did get kicked out of a few places but thatâ€™s to be expected when youâ€™re dealing with a bunch of tule following Karens. Just stop wearing it.</p>
