    <strong>What‚Äôs really going on with intelligent people?</strong>
    <p><p>For as long as I have lived, I have never considered myself to be what society calls ‚Äúsmart‚Äù. English is my second language, and although I‚Äôm at almost native-level fluent, I have never been able to express myself eloquently. There‚Äôs honestly times where I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/Jfq3c4Cf1Fs">Ricky from Trailer Park Boys</a>:</p>
<p>&rt; ‚ÄúYou know, your thoughts might be better than mine but I have thoughts going around in my head too about different thinkings and brain things that you can use.‚Äù</p>
<p>So when book-smart people talked, I used to listen‚Äîthey obviously read a lot more than I do, and are obviously very articulate. Clearly they knew how to think critically to be able to distinguish between the noise and objective truth.</p>
<p>All this has turned 180 degrees for me within the past several months. People I used to respect, we‚Äôre talking friends with Master‚Äôs Degrees in Engineering, Psychology, what have you, are completely plugged in. These are the people that have been taught to use their brain their whole lives. These people in the past would gladly debate you on politics, religion, meaning of life, and anything else you can think of. It was great to have them around as a breath of fresh air from the vanilla conversations of society.</p>
<p>So when one of my friends tells me he just got his second shot this week, I naturally want to start a conversation. Mind you, I‚Äôm not a provocative person; I take more of a Socratic approach by asking questions and see where I can take the conversation. I hate being imposed upon, so I make sure I don‚Äôt come off as pushy with my opinions.</p>
<p>Silence and an immediate (to the point of being rude) change of topic are the only responses I have been met with so far when I start asking questions and slowly introducing evidence of why this whole thing is bullshit and a scam. The only other response so far I‚Äôve gotten has been: ‚ÄúEh, better be safe than sorry‚Äù.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt need to have a bachelor‚Äôs degree, or be a conspiracy theorist to know at my core that this whole thing is not right.</p>
<p>What the hell happened to the intelligent people? I speak only for my personal network. It‚Äôs sad, because I can no longer respect them and will most likely decline any future attempts to spend time together. All of the sudden, that crazy friend who‚Äôs been spewing conspiracy theories for years seems like the most reasonable person.</p></p>

        <p>Higher education is left wing indoctrination but what you're witnessing is a religious-like cult masquerading as a pandemic. Cults often prey on intelligent people. Consider the BITE model and how it applies to the way we've been treated in the last year and see how a lot of it lines up to this abuse.</p>
<p>Also, you're a lot more intelligent than you realize. Your English is superb. Oftentimes a lot of highly intelligent people don't think they're as smart as they are.</p>

        <p>Yes. My entire fucking education was leftist propoganda. I spent several years deprograming myself after I left. It began with critical theory being the basis for all analysis and ends up in ecofemimist term papers and professors assigning topics on transhumanistic analysis of some or other journal article. Please look into James Lindsey and his work exposing grievance studies. These terrible ideas are spreading beyond their shitty programs into literature, sciences and even maths. Also the Evergreen College events where a liberal Jewish professor was hunted down by rainbow haired thugs and called a nazi for disagreeing with imposed segregation on a special day. I've lost all respect for academia and it's been emotionally crushing. I have my degree but I no longer care about something I put years into achieving due to wokeness infecting everything.</p>

        <p>This.  Seeing through the lies is a product of your critical thinking ability.  That is why there are skeptics of all intelligence levels, and very smart people who just blindly believe it all because the tv said so.</p>

        <p>My experiences align with yours. Almost all of my friends and family members‚Äîmany of whom are very intelligent, and all of my friends with college degrees ranging from bachelor‚Äôs to PhD‚Äîhave gotten vaccinated and look at me as if I were crazy for not. Meanwhile, yes, the ones saying things I considered on the fringe if not completely conspiratorial a few years back are the ones still willing to think critically. Sometimes it makes me wonder if I might be crazy. </p>
<p>The thing is, that critical thinking is so important. There is <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/994997/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_16.pdf">evidence from England</a> that shows vaccinated people died with the Delta variant at a higher rate than unvaccinated people (see page 12, and my post history if you want the full explanation). Someone shared this on reddit, and I decided to verify for myself if it‚Äôs true (it is). While I was working out the math, a vaccinated person in my life came over and asked why I was even looking into it. </p>
<p>I was legitimately at a loss for words. I was looking into something that got shared online to verify whether it was true for myself. Isn‚Äôt that what we‚Äôre supposed to do? I don‚Äôt even know how to deal with these people anymore.</p>

        <p>&rt;Almost all of my friends and family members‚Äîmany of whom are very intelligent, and all of my friends with college degrees ranging from bachelor‚Äôs to PhD‚Äîhave gotten vaccinated and look at me as if I were crazy for not</p>
<p>i recommend that you keep thinking about this, since intelligent people tend to have better critical thinking skills</p>
<p>&rt;vaccinated people died with the Delta variant at a higher rate than unvaccinated people </p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-delta-vaccinated-idUSL2N2OD2CJ">yes, that's true, but not for the reason you think</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;The authors then divide the number of deaths by the total number of people who tested positive for the Delta variant and found the rate of death to be 0.000957 for unvaccinated individuals and 0.00636 for those who have been inoculated...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;[D]eaths predominantly occur in older age groups who have had much higher vaccination coverage ... The vaccination program also prioritised ‚Äúclinically vulnerable‚Äù individuals, and thus the majority of those vaccinated will ‚Äúdisproportionately represent elderly and those with underlying comorbidities, who are already at significant risk of hospitalisation and death.‚Äù</p>

        <p>I appreciate the feedback. In my other posts about this, I acknowledge factors to consider for the difference in death rate, including that vaccinated people are more likely to be older or have comorbidities that would put them at greater risk for complications and death, anyway. I just didn‚Äôt go into it here, since that wasn‚Äôt what OP‚Äôs post is about. </p>
<p>As for intelligent people having better critical thinking skills: I also have a master‚Äôs. I know it‚Äôs not PhD level, but I‚Äôd wager my critical thinking skills are a bit above average.</p>

        <p>Look mate, I'm not a smart fella, I don't exactly recall but my IQ is on the low 80's  and I failed highschool (fuck math), and despite speaking 4 languages and seemingly appearing intelligent to others with a generous vocabulary,  I really am what you'd call a moron if there ever was a way to label me.</p>
<p>All that said, if there's one thing that I have learned about people; the only thing that really is true, is that no matter how stupid you think the general population is - they're twice stupider than that. </p>
<p>It is true, you know the term NPC? That's pretty much the only way you can describe most people. I don't know why that is, but it is what it is, and we ought to respect that in some way.</p>

        <p>You can be highly educated with zero critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>I think it comes down to two major factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the person have critical thinking skills?</li>
<li>Is the person concerned about what others think of them?</li>
</ol>
<p>I meet both these conditions (thinking critically and not being concerned) and I imagine many NNN members do as well. It takes both factors because you could think critically and even be aware of all the bullshit happening, but if you're too concerned about what others think to stand up for yourself, it won't matter.</p>

        <p>I cannot stress this enough: 
<strong>Education does not mean intelligence.</strong></p>
<p>A close friend who I had always admired for being ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, who has an MBA at an Ivy League and who has been very successful in life and previous careers basically called me an idiot and no longer talks to me when she told me she got her shot and I started asking her questions about it. The more sources I cited and the more points I brought up, the less she had to say other than ‚Äúno! You‚Äôre wrong, that‚Äôs not true, you need to stop looking at conspiracies‚Äù.
I couldn‚Äôt believe a person I had thought so ‚Äúsmart‚Äù had blindly accepted a medical treatment without ever knowing or bothering to look up a thing about it.</p>

        <p>I think everyone's perception is primarily formed by what they have experienced and their brains get trained in being faster to process the things they do the most.</p>
<p>So if someone makes the experience that memorizing what others tell them or what they read is rewarding, then they'll practice to excel at that.</p>
<p>I remember having been much less critical in the past than I am now and it was certain key-experiences that made me start to distrust politicians and vast parts of the media.</p>
<p>People who haven't gone through those experiences didn't have enough of a reason to reform their entire world-view and identity in this world.</p>
<p>I heard someone explain it with the height of fall that someone would have to endure when changing their world view. Someone who has nothing to lose can easily give their old views up for new ones. Someone who is deeply established within the existing system, won't just risk losing everything they have built up within it.</p>
<p>I am aware of quite a lot of people who play along, biding their time and act as if they believe what they think is expected of them to believe while not actually believing it.</p>
<p>People who, in private, tell me what they actually think but when there's other people around, act as if our conversation never happened.</p>
<p>It's hard to tell how many people are like that. But I suspect it's a rather significant percentage compared to both those who are open about their rejection of the new normal and those who embrace it.</p>
<p>I think inspiring them to being more open with their actual opinion by being a relatable example of someone who does this, is something we could strife for.</p>

        <p>It can definitely advantageous to camouflage one's beliefs or intentions. I mean that's pretty much survival 101, so I don't blame them, but it's dangerous if everyone does that, especially when we need to confront this evil head-on. It reminds me of bison hiding at the center of the herd while the lions search for the weakest or least-good-at-hiding individual. The problem with all that though is that hiding always selects for the biggest pussies and you never stop being prey.</p>

        <p>It's not really intelligence that they are lacking. It's an issue of morality and principal...honor and respect for your fellow man. They toss around these terms but if you observe their responses, they do not actually live up to them. To proponents of the new normal, all the "good will toward men" ends when someone or something else makes them feel scared. </p>
<p>Honestly, to some degree, we are all like that. It's important to continue to treat them like normal (as possible) so that they will see the light in us. Turning your back on them will confirm their belief that we are an enemy.</p>

        <p>The truth is, you go to school, you sit down, do as your told, and listen. And we reward that behaviour (arguably so in some cases). It takes discipline to get an A grade or a degree, not critical thinking. </p>
<p>I've noticed as I've got older ( and the age group between me and my teachers has narrowed) that we are not all that different; they are not the omniscient beings I used to think they were when I was in kindergarten. They too are human, and susceptible to bias / brainwashing. This fact was most clearly demonstrated to me when my calc teacher, who was ment to be teaching me about calculus, went on a 15 min rant about how it's important I vote, unless its for X party etc etc.</p>
<p>Intelligence is a weird thing and hard to define, but I would say it includes logic, reasoning, initiative, precognition, ability to adapt, and the ability to know when your being fooled.</p>

        <p>There is an inability to assess credibility in our culture right now as well as an inability to accept a view other than pushed by the government, through media (which in the case of Canada now receives government funding). The notion of "misinformation" and fact checkers didn't exact only years ago, for example. Even in the Iraq war debate in 2003 you were still allowed a differing view.</p>

        <p>My thoughts on how perfectly intelligent and rational people are suddenly acting like cult members is the sheer amount of propaganda out there. If a person wants a skeptical view on the vaccine you have to literally scroll to page 50 of the Google news section, and even then it's an article debunking some salient point someone is making. I mean they just can't fathom that the whole of the world can be wrong but if they were honest and know history they'd have to admit it hasn't happened only once but almost every hundred years throughout human civilization. The only difference is it's a global event this time.</p>

        <p>honestly, their entire self-image is based on their intelligence, which needs to be validated within the hierarchy of academia. There's too much status to lose in going against the grain. Also, if you watched the 3 hr Brett Weinstein video, a lot of people are taking so long because they can't understand that not everyone in academia, science, and medicine is genuinely as committed to intellectual honesty as they are and are motivated by politics and money instead</p>

        <p>People aren't really ever evaluating evidence. They only have regard for what confirms their preexisting biases. Very few people are willing to admit they are wrong. The more intelligent, the more able they are to produce all kinds of mind-bending justifications to get the eveidence to line up with what they already believe. By definition, people aren't aware of their own blind spots. There's a famous saying: it's easier to fool people than it is to convince them they've been fooled.</p>

        <p>The mRNA vaccines have a molecule that attaches to the walls of cells and synthesizes the spike protein from the random molecules in your system.  The spike protein enters your system and your immune system creates antibodies (?) against it.  When you become infected by Covid-19, your immune system already recognizes the spike proteins of the virus and are able to prevent it from taking hold.  </p>
<p>Okay - I'm sure I messed some of that up, but that's the gist.  I don't know how the other kind of vaccine works.</p>

        <p>Yes, absolutely I have considered that. This is exactly why I‚Äôm posing this question to the community.</p>
<p>The issue is: the people who are so dead-set on taking everything going on in the world at face value are not considering the possibility they may be crazy at all. It‚Äôs 100% full steam ahead in their beliefs from my experience.</p>

<p>Yeah.. I don't think you've consider that your evidences may not be foolproof and not bullshit....</p>
<p>People taking thing at face value is and always was the norm.... It infuriating when propaganda is involve but say if you see a fire on your house you try and put it out(taking it at face value) not stop to think whether your imaging it and or the reality of that situation (considering the possibilities).... You'd need foolproof evidences that your house isn't on fire to consider a different possibilities....</p>
<p>So... do you really think you've got some foolproof evidences that others with masters and doctors degrees are missing?  I think it's highly unlikely and it's might be your evidences aren't as foolproof as you think they are...</p>
<p>As for bring it to reddit.... you do realize that all of reddit are echo-chambers right?</p>

        <p>First off, based on your post, you are one of the absolute LAST people who needs to be talking about self-reflection.</p>
<p>Secondly, while it not might be in the most significant of ways for me personally, your ignorance and the ignorance of everybody else on r/NoNewNormal does in fact have an effect on my life.  See, this whole being against vaccines, lockdowns, science, and informing yourselves has basically made dealing with Covid a lot more of a pain in the ass than it should be.  And since you idiots can't get that through your thick fucking skulls, you're going to constantly be reminded of how your stubborness, ignorance, and victim complex is fucking things up.</p>
<p>Lastly, and this kinda loops back to the first point, after posting about how smart people make you insecure and you just have to despise them in return, you're going to tell me about how unhappy I am?  That's...your plan here?</p>
<p>I'm not going to go in to the concept of snark, sarcasm, or facetiousness because I've already wasted more time on this than I should have, but please.  Don't advertise your idiocy and then attempt to point out the supposed perceived flaws in others.  Really not a good look.</p>

<p>I would have taken this statement at face value and agreed with you... in March 2020.</p>
<p>15 months later, if you still that think everything happening in the world is about a virus, I'm not sure how much more evidence you need to take off the rose-colored glasses.</p>

        <p>Aww baby got butthurt. Bet your dumb ass thinks covid is a mega virus...its not and never was. There are intelligent people here but you are not among them.</p>
<p>Covid is a cold with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. Smart people aren't afraid of it. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. Most of the links below are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. Most of rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists/ scientists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>
<p>Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the Fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>
<p>Social  distancing doesn't work by MTI
https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4</p>
<p>Masks dont work, especially the fabric ones:</p>
<p>These are just some articles about masks:  not .gov links so take them with a grain of salt:</p>

<p>Now for the more medical journal type stuff on masks (most of these are referenced in the white paper in the next section, some say they work ans some say they don't...what they all show is the mandates are worthless)</p>

<p>In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>
