        <p>I saw a comment at LDS that basically went "Well, the politicians are acting on good faith, it's just that they are panicked over case numbers like everyone else, and acting only on fear." Upvoted a ton.</p>
<p>I just...find that incredibly naive. At this point, I can't believe people on "this side" actually think this is still a goof-up on the politicians' and media's behalf, instead of an act of malice.</p>

        <p>I think it’s a combination of the politicians being gutless and “orange man bad.”   I say the last part as someone who detests Trump.  But as the saying goes, even a broken clock is right twice day.   People just can’t stand the fact that he was right about the lockdowns.  And, as to the gutless part, the right thing to do is for governors to say, “We can’t wait for a vaccine, that may never exist.  Life needs to go on.  We are keeping tabs on hospital utilization and will help vulnerable folks isolate, but everyone else needs to back to work/school.”  But the politicians know that the press will tear them a part for that and all they care about is themselves.    Even the Republican governor in Texas has been caving to fear mongering.   Personally, I will never vote again for anyone who is currently in office in CA.   As to the press, I think their primary driver is simply Trump hate in the US.</p>

        <p>The virus isn't that big of a deal in reality so he was correct when he said that yet he still acted to stop the spread of it against all the advice of the Democrats and some Republicans nobody wanted him to close the borders don't forget that</p>
<p>Then you have Democratic Governors who literally put infected patients into nursing homes and people want to act like any of this is Donald Trump's fault</p>

        <p>It does seem ludicrously naive, yes, but on the other hand, speculation and conjecture isn't useful either and only serves to further alienate anyone that has been heavily conditioned to dismiss "conspiracy".</p>
<p>At some point you have a "you can lead a horse to water.." scenario. You can't force people to see what your interpretation of the facts are no matter how many facts are shown.</p>

        <p>When all decisions go in one direction; when less-restrictive measures are always and suddenly replaced with more restrictive ones (almost as if they "got the memo" a little late);  when numbers are deliberately twisted toward doom, and when those numbers end up going against the narrative, are replaced with other numbers; when contradictory scientific evidence is wildly misinterpreted, always toward doom; when evidence of inexpensive medicine is hastily "debunked", but announcements of marginal or dangerous <em>and very expensive</em> medicines are praised to the skies; when the goalposts are constantly shifted from "flatten the curve" all the way to "eliminate all virus infections, period" and "only when there's a vaccine"...  </p>
<p>...clearly there's an agenda. And it's not in our best interests.</p>

        <p>Malice to what end?  I appreciate this sub but not the conspiratorial side of it.  While I won't dismiss the fact that some people are certainly profiting off this situation, and others stand to benefit in some other way, I don't think that can explain away everything.</p>
<p>Your average politician is just a person like you and me.  Do you know anybody who's deathly afraid of this virus?  Because I sure as shit do.  Most people I interact with still think this is some horrible plague that has befallen us.  If they were my governor they would have done the same things my governor has done because they're just as afraid.  It's not like the data that shows this virus isn't that deadly is hidden from everyone; it's <em>out</em> there for all of us to see but people - including politicians - are ignoring it because they've fallen under the COVID spell.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if there's some ulterior motive for spreading the fear and keeping things locked down, why didn't this happen with Swine flu?  Or SARS?  Or MERS?  Or Zika virus?  Or bird flu?  Or ebola?  These were all viruses that the media started hyping up as "the big one", but interest fizzled out before any serious policy decisions were made.  If there really is some sinister cabal that's looking to control everyone for their own nefarious reasons, why did they wait for <em>this</em> virus to do it?</p>
<p>I can see how it's easy to fall into the belief that there <em>must</em> be some intent behind all of this when it seems obvious to those of us who post here that there's simply no good reason to continue doing what we're doing, and I do think there's a lot of doubling-down on the part of politicians some of whom might acknowledge that they over-reacted but can't show that.  I do also think Democrats are trying to weaponize the virus against Trump, but overall I think Hanlan's razor applies pretty well here: Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.</p>

        <p>I'm going to keep this short because I'm not in the mood to argue about this, but I feel like there is something going on behind the scenes. What that is? No one except the government, and possibly also the media, knows. But the insistance on the vaccine being the "solution" has been a notion pushed since the beginning in March when the "flatten the curve" notion was simultaneously being shoved down our collective throats. I always found that incredibly odd given that vaccines take around a decade to properly create, test, and distribute. It was even more suspicious to me when they gave the timeframe of "12 to 18 months" before the vaccine could be distributed. Again, more red flags. And many governors insist that we must continue masks and/or lockdowns until the vaccine is made, which makes me think they know something. The whole thing felt odd there. This is especially true since they've rejected every therapeutic, including Remdesvir which they use in hospitals and got FDA approved, but even that, apparently, doesn't matter because only the vaccine does.</p>
<p>Not just that, but the media and governments continue to push the "New Normal". Even back in, yet again, March, there was more insistance that life as we know it is gone, and we must now adapt to a new lifestyle. It feels creepy, and like blatant propaganda. </p>
<p>I also feel like, especially at this point, we can't attribute everything these people are doing to stupidity. Sorry, but that is naive as fuck. They have the same data these subs have. I've seen LDS claim that these governors just "don't have the same data we do". Bullshit. Complete horseshit. They and the "experts" have the exact data we do, they follow the CDC and WHO, etc. There is another agenda at play here, and they are simply ignoring the data for IFR and other facts that demote this virus to a nothingburger. This is being done purposefully because they assume (sadly, correctly) that people are too dumb to interpret the data in any other way than what they and the media say it to be. They are manipulating the masses, to what end? I can't say for sure. Something has been amiss about this whole shitshow from the get-go, and I tried telling people this, and people either laughed at me or chastized me. </p>
<p>Sure, it could be stupidity, but I honestly believe they are just trying to pull the wool over people's eyes, and they are succeeding at it because people like you seem to believe that government trying to hurt or control people is something only seen in movies.</p>
<p>Oh, and for the record, I was never hardcore into conspiracy theories before this. The most I dabbled in was watching stuff like Unsolved Mysteries or whatever. However, call it intuition or something, but this whole thing has reeked to me since the beginning.</p>

        <p>I am a mild conspiracy theorist (mainly read them for entertainment) but this screamed conspiracy from the get go.</p>
<p>Ronald Bernard predicted two years ago that exaggerated pandemics would be used as a tool for control and profit. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hcqmgu/2_yrs_ago_ronald_bernard_warned_pandemics_are_a/">I posted the excerpt</a> to r/conspiracy a while ago.</p>
<p>Look at how divided people are within their own parties. Liberals no longer give a **** about educating inner city kids, for example. They also no longer care about working mothers. So much for feminism.</p>
<p>The way this has divided people is downright Machiavellian. Control is achieved through divide and conquer, and by impoverishment.</p>
<p>The profit from this for big pharma and big plastic is basically incalculable.</p>
<p>Does it go deeper? Possibly. Is every politician in on it? Probably not. Where is trump in all this? A victim or an agitator? I have no clue.</p>

<p>I was saying this when multi-billions of dollars were funneled to the bankers in 2008.  The largest daylight robbery in modern history. They don't feel the need to hide any more.  It's as if they know their system is reaching end-game so the time has come to extract everything they can.</p>

        <p>There's a big difference between fart-sniffing "skeptics" and free-thinkers. Some people are basically gullible conformists but want to be known as skeptics in order to seem cool. These people will never accept the simple truth that covid-1984 is a hoax, because they're afraid of being labeled a "conspiracy-theorist"</p>
<p>A free-thinker is already cool as a cucumber, and is therefore able to follow the truth wherever it might lead.</p>

        <p>No sweetie, Trump is just an actor -his greasy mob is behind this whole thing. Supporting Covid 1984 is supporting Trump, operation WarpSpeed and a police state.</p>
