    <strong>A little premature, doncha think?</strong>
    <p><p>So we start getting millions upon millions of people vaccinated and suddenly everything is going back to normal: places are opening up, masks are coming off. All thanks to the vaccine! Yay!</p>
<p>Wait ... As of this moment, 56 Million people are fully vaccinated. There are 7.8 Billion people on earth. That's less than one percent of the people on earth who have been vaccinated. We haven't quite cured covid yet.</p>
<p>Throw this on the pile of things that don't make sense.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, this post was inspired by the local news saying that schools are opening up and a hospital doesn't have covid patients.</p></p>

        <p>Biden had to clear up covid in 100 days or less in order to prove he was better than Trump. So yeah, he basically has to start lifting restrictions now. </p>
<p>You didn't think this was about our safety and health, did you?</p>

        <p>I hope people like Dr Tenpenny are wrong. She was going through animal data of past experimental mRNA vaccines. She found that if the animal was infected with the pathogen the vaccine was supposed to protect against, or was very sick due to a similar virus, the vaccine enabled an exaggerated cytokine response that ended up killing the host. </p>
<p>So technically the vaccine was a ticking time bomb.</p>
<p>If true, then we are in for a verrrrryyyy rough winter of 21/22.</p>

        <p>Sweden was open, had schools open, is doing better than others.</p>
<p>Florida opened earlier, had the superbowl with tons of people celebrating mask less, a very old at risk population, and they're doing just as good, if not better, than most states.</p>
<p>The at risk people can stay home and we can stop sacrificing children and businesses to appease the great covid monster because it didn't seem to help much, if at all.</p>
