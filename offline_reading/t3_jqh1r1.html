        <p>He is/was a physicist writing about epidemiology who has to publish on non-peer reviewed platforms as the work is so weak it would never make it passed peer review. </p>
<p>If that does not concern you, this is someone that thinks that rising CO2 levels have nothing to do with wildfires (1) and that cancer is caused by a breakdown in homeostasis rather than mutations in DNA (2). Are you going to say that this person represents the best you have to support your position because he publishes a lot of demonstrably wrong information on topics he knows little about?</p>

        <p>Actually there is a reason why your sentiment can't be true.</p>
<p>Listening to someone purely because they are a scientist is an argument from authority fallacy. This person has the credentials of a scientist but does not act or think like one - the fundamentals of methodological naturalism and Popper's falsifiability are clearly missing as two examples. They have a history of pseudo-scientific behaviour and this is yet another example of his quackery.</p>
<p>I have the same credentials as this person and actually in a more appropriate field (medicine) but I can pretty much guarantee that you are not going to listen to me purely because I am/was a scientist. You need to evaluate the claims based on the evidence and from the arguments constructed and supported by them.</p>
<p>TL;DR quacks gonna quack - instead use high quality evidence to create strongly supported positions</p>

        <p>I don’t think you disagree with me. I’m talking about the general sentiment which is that people who say “well I just listen to The Science/scientists” ignore that there is no monolithic The Science. There are scientists that can make a variety of credible claims that contradict each other, none of which should dictate public policy alone because we don’t elect scientists. We elect mayors, senators, etc.</p>

        <p>This guy is insane. No wonder this article is neither peer reviewed nor published in a reputable journal - and trust me if you had genuine evidence that the deaths being assigned to COVID really being "mass homicide by government response" you would get published incredibly quickly by Nature or Science.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no review of genome work</li>
<li>There is no review of animal models</li>
<li>The author dismisses the COVID peak cause without evidence and his postulation is not even a testable hypothesis, it's just a wild assertion</li>
<li>Rural states only entering the first stages of COVID infection are given as examples of lockdowns and COVID peaks not aligning (note that COVID deaths are rising)</li>
<li>A single citation on the efficacy of the efficacy of masks, social distancing and lockdowns smells of cherry picking and is shown by the fact that its another researchgate article not a peer reviewed and published article and one that has been lambasted for "pseudoscientific mistakes as well as the low academic quality of the work"</li>
</ul>
<p>To believe this you have stopped being rational and are just looking for something to convince yourself that you are correct.</p>

        <p>I critiqued a scientific paper by addressing the fundamental flaws and your response was to accuse me of a position I don't have with no evidence supporting you. </p>
<p>If you think that this is attacking my argument then I think we can all guess what level of school you dropped out of. I can only guess you were too busy with the crayons to pay attention to comprehension, critique, methodological naturalism and the fundamentals of science and rational thinking.</p>

        <p>Typical response from a low iq overeducated hypocrite romantically in love with government mandates and pseudoscientific studies you cite to impose restrictions on free right to travel and bodily autonomy of independent people. The very positions you take only lead to one outcome and that is democide. Take your phd and your virtue signaling back to the commie institutions that gave you that worthless thing. 🍻</p>
