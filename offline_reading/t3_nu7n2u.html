    <strong>The most frustrating part of covid to me</strong>
    <p><p>There has been a lot of irritating things during this past year and change regarding Covid, but the sheer hypocrisy of government officials and celebrities has got to be the thing that gets my blood boiling more than anything else</p>
<p>It’s bad enough that they ruin livelihoods and stole a whole year from our lives due to this stuff, but it gets a whole lot worse when the ones in charge disregard the rules. Deblasio dancing with his wife in Times Square on new years eve for all to see after banning everyone else from going, Gavin Newsom going to a fancy restaurant with friends while banning that same thing, and the laundry list of governor Whitmer disregarding her own fucking rules as if it were just a weather forecast, and Pelosi going and getting a blowout at a salon. </p>
<p>Even more than that, the special treatment celebrities and movie studios got is also horseshit. That story of the woman who’s outdoor dining setup had to close down while an identical setup across the street for a movie studio was A-ok. All of these pieces of shit dictating what freedoms we were entitled to and which ones could be thrown out, locking us down as if we were just some cattle, all while telling us how horrible we are for protesting the rules they toss aside whenever it’s convenient.</p>
<p>Throughout the shutting down of businesses there was a lot of talk about “essential work”, but making movies isn’t fucking essential, nor is dictating the use of our rights. These government officials barring us from working and going out freely got to sit on their asses and enjoy all the freedoms they stole from us. And then they’ll talk about “we’re all in this together”, what a fucking insult.</p>
<p>This all just shows what they think of us common folk. They think we’re lesser. They think we’re plebeians who deserve to be bossed around and to be subjugated. Just cattle to milk taxes out of to fund their worthless sorry asses. </p>
<p>Sorry if this is a rambly mess, I just couldn’t keep this bottled up anymore</p></p>

        <p>Right there with ya on how unaffected the elites of the entertainment industry have been! I’ve been saying for months now how are they mysteriously able to keep shooting their projects and somehow no one from casts or crews have dropped dead? </p>
<p>There’s of course an answer for everything that “proper safety protocols are working” or possibly my favorite “well maybe they’ve had the vaccines early somehow”. I mean what the hell right there the mob is proving our point by acknowledging the severe gap of privilege and freedom between us and the top 1%!</p>
<p>What really got me was a few months back when Ridley Scott was shooting his new movie with Lady Gaga, Adam Driver and Al Pacino. They were filming on a university campus in Italy which all students had been barred from since early last year and yet the Hollywood lot saunter in like nothing’s amiss. Let alone that someone like Pacino’s meant to be a prime candidate for a Rona death. </p>
<p>Also the fact that Mission Impossible 7 has been shooting for months on end to keep up the charade of carefulness, traveling around the world to do so and yet somehow we don’t have a cast of dead stars on our hands?! Soon we’ll be told that Tom Cruise is under Xenu’s protection or some bullshit lol.</p>
<p>It’s staring us right in the face and you raise many compelling points that should be spread like wildfire. The divide never ceases and they want us to know this at all times. Subliminally beating us into submission.</p>

        <p>Speaking of movies, they are no longer created for the benefit of the audience, but as vanity projects. Actors forget that they are mere performers, meat puppeteers, instead viewing their jobs as special privileges. And that's where most of the "representation" controversies come from.</p>

        <p>I noticed this too. Media pre-2010(ish) seemed to be made to entertain you. Now everything exists to exploit you. Movies/TV/music are all 100 propaganda with low-effort stories and video games are designed to addict you and get you to keep buying microtransactions (lootcrates, outfits, etc).</p>

        <p>Yesterday in Montreal there was a fairly large hockey celebration outdoors with hundreds of people.  All closing up together, boozing, high fiving.</p>
<p>The Media covered it as a "celebration".  "Isn't it great to see so many people together outside?"</p>
<p>This is one month after our massive anti-lockdown protest.  The way that was covered?  "THIS IS A SUPER SPREADER EVENT!!  ALL OF THE PEOPLE ARE SELFISH AND WANT TO KILL GRANDMA!!"</p>
<p>I've pointed this out to people, and they just shrug like nothing strange has occurred.</p>
<p>I think these next few months are going to be particularly obnoxious.  They are all just going to continue on and pretend like nothing has happened.  They will never acknowledge what they have put us through.</p>

        <p>Celebrities and politicians are controlled people. Despite being part of the "rich and powerful" most of them are only able to maintain their lifestyles thanks to the ones who really control wealth and power. If a celebrity does not toe the line, they will be shunned by whatever entertainment business they are a part of. If a politician does not do what they are told the campaign money dries up and they will be out of office before they know it. Once the money dries up they are just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Whatever entertainers and politicians may tell us, they have no real autonomy because their money and power is bought anf paid for by someone else.</p>

        <p>I pointed this out to a doomer and he excused it by saying that if we ALL did it, there would be problems, but if only SOME people do it...  </p>
<p>You know what though?  I paid him back for annoying me like that.  Dude's had a crush on me since like 2006, even fantasized about me (a lot) when he was married.  After that comment defending the elites, I told him he had zero chances of ever sleeping with me.  Totally would have banged him if he was anti-lockdown, too.</p>
