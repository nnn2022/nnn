    <strong>PCR lobotomy / contagion / wtf?</strong>
    <p><p>Hyvää päivää to u/Jizoh I thought of sending you a message but I'll write here for the sake of sharing,</p>
<p>I saw posts from people that work in labs or have experience with PCR testing and I just recently took a PCR test in Chile and honestly, I've never been this worried. First of all, to me it felt as if the test contained some material or product, like it had some baking soda or something chemically charged on the tip and after one hour - I started feeling that there "was something going on" in my brain, namely in the upper forehead/ frontal lobes. And it wasn't pain but rather, and I don't know what to make of it, but like it was burning away or silencing the brain in that area. I felt in my cognition that I wanted to formulate a thought or follow a complex line of reasoning and it felt as a ghost limb symptom but with my thinking. In other words, I feel lobotomised and that there's something chipping away at my brain and my complex thinking/intuition. Have you ever heard anyone react this way from a pcr test? I had surgeries when I was a kid for troubles breathing which I forgot to inform the staff about - could this have left the area more sensitive and have caused the feeling? But even so, why a feeling far up in the brain and not just the back of the nose? My gf was in tears after the test and felt traumatised and had a headache and had to rest. She doesn't want to worry and neither do I but I take the sensations from within my head very seriously and just can't ignore that to me, they administered something to me which is now fucking me up. </p>
<p>I honestly was cool as a cucumber before and during the test but afterwards as soon as I noticed something in my <em>brain</em>, and again it was something clearly different from headache, it was more like "ok so I am actually under the influence of a drug now" (maybe it's "brain fog"?) I got really preoccupied. I also felt that my taste and smell were impaired, confusing af - supposed covid symptoms now from outta nowhere that ofc point to even more shadyness with the whole PCR and false positive situation.</p>
<p>Please if anyone has any info that might help me let me know and if you work with PCR tests - you gotta inspect those swabs or something, or let me know why I shouldn't panic please </p>
<p>(if you google on this, there's the reassuring-not-so-reassuring fact checkers and medical sites that just say that safety procedures are so good that you have virtually no reason to worry and then there's the tinfoil camp according to which I have gotten ethylene oxide, morgellon nanobots or the actual covid virus itself, all in all, not super easy to avoid confusion. Also, this sensation of something chipping away at the brain is something I haven't come across at all.)</p></p>

        <p>Yeah it's easy to imagine stuff like that, you could imagine bugs crawling on you or something and get itchy (won't work with everything, "important" "actual threats" work best). The thing about COVID taking away smell may be one of these psychic bombs, people imagine they can't smell, just like you did, as you say. They take it as proof they had COVID and not a cold, which also makes them heroic survivors  of sorts, a badge of honor.</p>
<p>But it's best to keep spreading the "misinformation" that PCR tests are a "brain tickle" and they put nanoworms in your brain. There are videos with a microscope showing black moving strands on a test if you look for them. The goal is to reduce "vaccination preparedness" and compliance among general population, even if just a little.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your reply but I do not fully understand what your stance is, could you elaborate a little bit more? Are you saying that you believe they are in fact using PCR to plant nanoworms and induce so called "Covid symptoms"?  </p>
<p>(I find it insane that if it really is the PCR that produces this loss of smell, how wouldn't there be an avalanche of people making that connection? I never had any weird feeling in my brain nor anything going on with my smell up until 1 hr after the PCR test yet from what I can gather americans and many others have been taking multiple PCR tests for months, surely something like this would've been widely noticed.)</p>

        <p>I had to take the test a couple of times for travel, it's pretty unpleasant and that sensation can last even a day (my friend had a teary eye and sneezing until the next day) but I'd say everything beyond that is in your head.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your reply, it seriously helps me as I am genuinely confused.</p>
<p>Should just mention that I remember having been swabbed as a child and that the sensation was unpleasant but 0 pain or 0 effects afterwards, 0 acidic feeling where there was swabbing, unlike now. This is also something that made me worry that "they definitely got something on that thing" - but I hear you and other testimonies from people that say that they did have a rough time immediately after and that that's it. Hopefully it's just a strong sinus cavity reaction but I digress, cheers</p>

        <p>I know people that had to take it 2-3 times a week for the whole past year, even they turned out fine (at least until now lol), I wouldn't worry too much for one or a couple of tests. It is pretty invasive though, and unneccessary but I, too, digress haha. Just don't think about it, the sensation will go away.</p>

        <p>It wasn't that intense for me, but I can relate that it felt like something was on the swab. I can only describe the sensation as acidic. Why did it burn that much? I couldn't breathe out that side of my nose for several days and that side still felt congested for over a week. I haven't had one since.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing and that was exactly my sensation too, definitely something acidic not just the scraping that I felt there... and it persisted throughout the day. If they are just extracting something and it is a completely dry tip why does that occur? I mean I *hope* it is a reaction against a foreign object that creates irritation but again, I can't let go of that sensation that there was something acidic... unsettling.</p>

        <p>Mine burned for hours as well. It didn't make sense to me either. I'm not particularly paranoid about it, but it was VERY odd and unexpected. I'm so fucking tired of all of this. I just accidentally read part of an article explaining why the 80,000 who died of flu awhile back only did so because some other person gave it to them. It's scary times. I just want to buy a piece of land in a red state and farm it.</p>
