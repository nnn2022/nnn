        <p>They want us to go 100% cashless so they can hide their thefts even more than they do now.</p>
<p>The IMF 18 step to becoming cashless</p>
<p>Official full publication: https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/wp15224.pdf</p>
<p>An implementation of the transition from paper standard to electronic money could take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Announce technical feasibility of eliminating the zero lower bound.</li>
<li>Strengthen macro-prudential regulation by raising equity requirements substantially above those prescribed by Basel III.</li>
<li>Ask banks and other financial firms to make contingency plans for negative interest rates.</li>
<li>Develop accounting standards for negative interest rates that take electronic money as the unit of account, and give to paper money the value of its worth in the market relative to electronic money.</li>
<li>Ask government agencies to prepare contingency plans for negative interest rates and non-par valuation of paper money.</li>
<li>Make it clear no one has the right to pay off large debts to the government in contexts where transactions are now routinely conducted with bank money.</li>
<li>Establish by law that debtors do not have the right to pay off large debts with paper currency at par when the market value of paper currency is below par.</li>
<li>Formally make money in central-bank certified bank accounts legal tender.</li>
<li>Announce the intent to introduce an electronic money system. (We are here now)</li>
<li>Lower the central bank’s interest rate on reserves to zero or slightly below zero.</li>
<li>Lower the central bank’s target interest rate, interest rate on reserves, and the central bank’s lending rate substantially below zero.</li>
<li>If there is any sign of large increases in paper currency withdrawal, institute a time-varying deposit charge (levied on net deposits) when banks deposit paper currency with the central bank in exchange for reserves.</li>
<li>Discount vault cash applied to reserve requirements by the factor of (1-deposit charge).</li>
<li>Implement the accounting standards appropriate for negative interest rates and non-par valuation of paper currency.</li>
<li>Require payment of taxes and other substantial debts to the government in electronic form.</li>
<li>Implement the contingency plans for government agencies.</li>
<li>Ask all firms to post prices in terms of electronic money.</li>
<li>Make it clear that firms are allowed to specify in contracts (including loan contracts) and in retail sale the terms under which they will accept paper currency.</li>

        <p>There was definitely a real coin shortage last summer. I could barely get quarters anywhere, and the city I was living in at the time didn’t have my bank, so it was extra annoying.</p>
<p>I usually don’t use cash much at all, but I needed them to do laundry at my apartment complex.</p>

        <p>That one was a bit too obvious, but people fell for it/ "Coin shortage"... Where the fuck did all the money GO? Bullshit! It was deliberate restriction of money by the banks to drive the change to a cashless society where they control all.</p>

        <p>As someone who relies on a coin op laundry there def was a shortage of quarters last year. The owners basically had to check anyone using the change machine to ensure they were actually doing laundry. They had to keep the quarters in a closed loop. Other than that I don’t usually carry much cash.</p>

        <p>Whatever coin shortages there were were caused entirely by people hoarding coins. You could cause a "shortage" of literally anything by just announcing that there's a horrible shortage of it</p>

        <p>It think the issue was people weren’t hoarding coins  but suddenly buying everything online and no longer leaving the house. What they might have bought with cash at a local store is going to Amazon via card so no one is out circulating money.</p>

        <p>My dirty laundry felt it, that's for sure...and apparently it's happening AGAIN.  Such a bunch of bullshit.  I asked my bank today when I got my allotted single roll of quarters so that I could do three loads of laundry and then walk back to the bank in the rain again 2 days from now.   Get this: Even the BANK couldn't explain why they were rationing quarters !  Are people eating them now.  Do we have some new demographic of weird people we will be forced to be tolerant of that throws them away, uses them as garnishes, what ???   </p>
<p>I'm just sick of it.  How are people who rely on quarters supposed to do the laundry ?   I got blasted by some virtue signaler for daring to complain about Safeway refusing me even enough quarters for just one load !</p>

<p>They probably want to promote a cashless society so that way they can further control everyone. It would be hard to avoid tax ~~scams~~ fees by the government if its all digital and they can just automatically withdraw it from your account. </p>
<p>Oh yeah, I saw a story about a business owner who refused the covid agenda and the government actually took the fine money out of his bank account. Yup. So guess where the future is heading...</p>
