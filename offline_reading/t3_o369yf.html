        <p>I don’t understand why a shot for Covid hits PSA levels and irregular/heavy periods.  Neither of those are immune responses, to my knowledge, so what is causing that?</p>

        <p>Sadly, we already know what's causing it and no one cares. This vaccine does not stay localized to the shoulder like it's supposed to. It's spreading throughout the body and that seems to have varying effects.</p>
<p>The better question is why is this information is being suppressed? Do we not want people to be informed because it might get in the way of global vaccination goals? </p>
<p>This is what happens when politics takes precedence over proper science and good medicine.</p>

        <p>But people in the economically better countries hardly breed at all now and are getting the vaccine in abundance. US, Europe and Japan have all but given up. Many not wanting kids. 
But all the excessive breeders Africa and India etc can’t get a vaccine if they could buy it.</p>
<p>Surely if you want to lower the world’s population you’d do something to target these places better.</p>

        <p>&rt; This vaccine does not stay localized to the shoulder like it's supposed to</p>
<p>I keep seeing this misinformation - but the vaccines are not intended to stay localized in the shoulder. The point of injecting it into a muscle is that there are a fuckton of blood vessels in the muscle, to get it into your system generally. It's more efficient distribution than a single vein.</p>

<p>&rt; First up: unlike the layer of fat just under our skin, muscle has an excellent blood supply to help disperse the vaccine, says Joanna Groom, an immunology researcher at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute.</p>
<p>In addition, it also gets destroyed faster in the bloodstream, allowing less immunity:
&rt; Muscle is a bit of a Goldilocks tissue for doling out vaccines to our immune cells: not too slow, but not too fast either.
&rt; As well as providing a ready pool of dendritic cells, muscle acts as a "deposit", where the vaccine can linger a while and be used over a longer period.
&rt; This allows for an extended immune system training session, Dr Groom says, which "is thought to result in maximal activation of the immune system".
&rt; A vaccine injected directly into the bloodstream, on the other hand, is vulnerable to destruction.</p>

        <p>You’re a moron. Your own link link is talking about the <strong>immune response</strong> spreading throughout. Obviously that is ideal. </p>
<p>How vaccines are supposed to work is they stick in the shoulder muscle and spill over to the lymph nodes, which then broadcast the immune response. </p>
<p>The last thing we want is free spike proteins in organs and the blood supply, and, in fact, that is the major concern with these vaccines right now.</p>

<p>No, I'm not. It literally says the vaccine. Which means sense, your leukocytes (white blood cells) are predominately inside your circulatory system.</p>
<p>&rt; in fact, that is the major concern with these vaccines right now.</p>
<p>According to who? Not any scientists or doctors it sure as hell isn't. The spike protein is harmless.</p>

        <p>The early safety claims (possible still available in Science Mag I believe) expressly said that the reason for injecting into the should was that it would stay localized. I remember specifically because there were lots of comments on that article saying that it wouldn't stay localized.</p>
<p>If the manufacturers are now claiming it was always meant to diffuse it is most definitely a "We were always at war with Eastasia" moment.</p>
<p>Either way, the spike protein is what causes the harm for both COVID and the vaccine. having it go all over the place is definitely not a good idea.</p>

<p>Do you have a source for this?</p>
<p>&rt; Either way, the spike protein is what causes the harm for both COVID and the vaccine</p>
<p>No it isn't. This isn't how viruses work whatsoever. No viruses, ever.</p>
<p>The spike protein in a COVID virus allows it to interface with and bypass your cell's membrane, but the spike protein doesn't do anything by itself.</p>
<p>The reason viruses are dangerous is that they infect your cell, causing it to create a ton of viral clones until your cell lyses, and those clones go on to infect your cells, creating more viral clones, etc, etc, etc</p>
<p>The spike protein can't do anything by itself. How would that process even work?</p>

        <p>This isn't the original source of the claim I saw, but it might have it as one of the subsources. I also couldn't help but notice you have not sourced anything yourself. The burden of proof is on those that advocate for an intervention, that's you.</p>
<p>https://theconversation.com/why-do-we-get-shots-in-the-arm-its-all-about-the-muscle-161259</p>
<p>The whole function of the spike protein is to allow the virus access to the cells, so it latches to the ACE-2 receptor. That's why you see clotting issues. The PEG nano-particle is also a lipid, which can enter cells and cause a dysregulated immune reaction. What's more, the whole point of this vaccine is to create tons of clones of the spike protein. When it does that, and if the spike protein latches to the cell walls to be presented to T-lymphocytes, the cell is killed by cytotoxic apoptosis, which cause blebbing, which is where the cell wall (with the spike protein attached) forms little bubbles that float away in the blood stream. Those blebes are pro-inflammatory themselves.</p>
<p>There are HEAPS of mechanisms by which this things could go horribly and catastrophically wrong. People who think otherwise are only fooling themselves. Again: It is up to advocates to prove safety, harm is assumed for any new intervention.</p>

        <p>If you are telling the truth, make a video of a magnet at the end of a string, and show how it deflects the string toward the arm. That's far more believable on video than something sticking to a person directly, which is much more easily faked.</p>

        <p>It was worse than that. She said <strong>3.4</strong>, not 2.4.</p>
<p>0.4 times 9 = 3.6, so they rounded a little bit, so more like the PSA levels rose 850%</p>

        <p>It's a book in the angels and demons series. Basically, a scientist recognizes the inevitable population explosion coinciding with the fact that there isn't enough space or resources to accommodate that many people. </p>
<p>It's a great book, and while I don't want to spoil the twist, I feel it's relevant to the real world discussion. Our main character is lead to believe, throughout a majority of the story, that there will be a horrible plague that violently kills 99 percent of people on earth. He takes every measure to stop this from happening.</p>
<p>But in the end, it is revealed that the antagonist has already released his "plague." The "plague" is revealed to be a Contraceptive, effectively neutering 50 percent of the world's population. It is essentially a humane solution to the very real and factual problem, compared to what the book led you to believe was going to happen.</p>

        <p>Oh... hmm, I wonder if this is a form of "predictive programming"? Like, for example, I heard that our thoughts can form or create a reality or "thing" or "happening" in our world, and if enough minds think or wish for the same thing then it becomes a reality. </p>
<p>Maybe Dan Brown subconsciously wanted to write about depopulation? Or maybe he was asked to? Lately I've seen a few movies or TV shows that talked about depopulation. There's that older movie 'Children of Men', and there's the somewhat bizarre/goofy TV show (on Amazon Prime?) called 'Utopia', both of which covered depopulation aspects.</p>

        <p>Maybe. It's a real problem that absolutely needs to be addressed if the species is to survive. I know it's basically the 'Thanos argument' but it's true.</p>

        <p>Population has been decreasing for years everywhere on earth. Most counties are well below the replacement rate of 2.1, even countries like India and Mexico. It’s going to be a real problem in years to come so there is no knowledgeable person that would be opining that world governments would be looking for ways to reduce the population. That’s exactly the opposite of what’s happening. Governments are actively looking for ways for their people to have more kids. Why would they then release a virus or a vaccine to reduce the population, already compounding what is going to be a very serious problem? They wouldn’t. It’s an insane theory backed by zero facts or even the barest knowledge of current events.</p>

I had it twice and dealing with a skin issue I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy from it so dont come at me and so easyly call "bullshit" when you not the one in my shoes.. I have a hypersensitive immune system do you even know what's a autoimmune disease with out googling it??? And my question was asking does the vaccine and covid have the same effects I'm asking for education and enlightenment and what do I get? A weak ass reply from some sp ecial needs pe rson and getting downvoted. Dont make me hate the one place I find to still be normal in a world full of cl#wns!</p>
