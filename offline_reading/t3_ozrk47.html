    <strong>No, unvaccinated people are not the reason why we're still in this. They never were</strong>
    <p><p>This seems increasingly harder to accept for doomers all around the world simply because that's what they've been repeatedly told by the media. </p>
<p>After all aren't unvaccinated people the perfect scapegoats ? It's so much easier to blame them than to start questionning the media and the government. The cold hard truth that we live in a world much darker than we think, that is ruled and controlled by evil people that only care about money and power...not you, is very hard to accept for the average person.</p>
<p>This propaganda campaign aimed at unvaccinated people is meant to divide. That is because if people are busy fighting against each other then their attention will be diverted from the real ennemy. An united population is what scares the ruling class, because they are the bringer of change. Did you notice that over the years people got more and more polarized, especially on social media ? Yeah this has been going on way before covid. </p>
<p>Going back on topic. People have been fed a lot of lies that we need to debunk.</p>
<p>First of, people naively believe that if 100% of the population get vaccinated the virus will magically disappear. That's not how it works and it never work that way. </p>
<p>Vaccinating close to 100% of the population, hell even more than 80% is absolutely impossible unless you're willing to go full Gestapo mode and send the army to force people to take the jab.
But let's assume 100% of the population gets vaccinated, why do you expect vaccines that were primarily made to reduce symptoms, not transmission, to be enough to make an incredibly resilient virus disappear ?
Here's what the CDC director recently had to say about the covid vaccines : “They continue to work well for Delta, with regard to severe illness and death – they prevent it. But what they can't do anymore is prevent transmission.” 
Source : https://web.archive.org/web/20210805232759/https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-08-05-21/h_d2accec79fdc37f422d02c536828ea1e</p>
<p>All of this is not even accounting for the fact that mass vaccinating during a pandemic is not only foolish but dangerous. Why ? Because "leaky" vaccines that aren't efficient enough at preventing transmission are the perfect breeding ground for more virulent variants.
Don't believe me ? That's fine, here's some research paper on the subject : https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002198</p>
<p>It was used as a reference for this interesting article : https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/leaky-vaccines-enhance-spread-of-deadlier-chicken-viruses</p>
<p>So what can we do against covid is those experimental vaccines won't cut it ? Well, how about we actually start treating people that are infected with covid ? I'm still baffled that some of you believe that the government actually cares about saving lives when their response to the pandemic is "oh you got covid ? Sorry we're not going to do anything about it, just stay home and hopefully it doesn't get too bad to the point where you have to get to the hospital".</p>
<p>There are tons of effective treatments against covid. Hqc, ivermectin, azithromycin, zinc and so many other. Medecine that we know is safe because they've all been FDA approved and used for decades. Unlike you dear vaccines whose long term side effects are still unknown to this day. </p>
<p>Anyways that'll be it for now, can people try to refute what I've said ?</p></p>

<p>As others have noted, it's become a religion.</p>
<p>To reject the vaccine, is to reject baptism.</p>
<p>To suggest that COVID is a slightly worse version of the seasonal flu, is to deny the existence of hell.</p>
<p>To disagree with "The Science" or the media,  is to blaspheme against god and his angels.</p>

        <p>I'm starting to be of the mind that pharma and govt knows full well about leaky vaccine risk, and probably wouldn't mind if it gets realized.  Imagine if it does happen where newer variants become less and less vaccine resistant and more and more lethal for the unvaxxed:</p>
<p>Pharma ends in a position where you'll have to either pay for the latest booster or risk certain death.</p>
<p>Govt end in a position where the population is now reliant on something else (regular vaccine boosters) to not die.  Either they're malicious here, or clueless (see: Biden).</p>
<p>Given that the vaccine is now clearly leaky, it should be stopped and saved for only the highest risk (elderly or many complications) and this trial period on the population needs to be ended.  At least until a real, working vaccine is developed.</p>

        <p>Covid already doesn’t have selective pressure to become less deadly though. People die 14 days after getting infected and are already past their most contagious phase which was when they were barely feeling cold symptoms. If Covid has less chances to mutate in vaccinated individuals. The more people that get vaccinated, the less mutations there will be. There is no argument against that.</p>

        <p>That makes ZERO sense. If an unvaccinated and previously I infected person catches Covid, it takes a certain amount of time for the body to begin mounting an antibody response and neutralize the virus. It happens much faster in people with prior immunity. Stop making shit up or buying into junk science to confirm your biases. Don’t like the vaccine? Fine. Like to lie about it? You’re an asshole</p>

        <p>Because it just doesn’t. Vaccines mean less viral replication. Less viral replication means less chance for the virus to mutate. Vaccination doesn’t differ from prior infection in that regard either if for whatever reason you think the vaccinated would cause a mutation that is more deadly, previously infected people would pose the same risk.</p>

        <p>The current Covid vaccines absolutely reduce infection and they reduce the length of time that the infection is active in your system if you get it. Both of those reduce replication. </p>

        <p>That is absolutely untrue. Not even sure what weird leap of logic or source lead you to that conclusion. The reason severity of disease is lessened is because your body is more quick to respond to the viral infection, thereby containing it. By containing the infection, you reduce the amount of replication cycles it can undergo and reduce the size of the resulting immune response needed. The reduction in amount of replication reduces the chance of mutations.</p>

        <p>Cool, good thing the concept of booster shots exists. Though again, even if you do manage to prove waning efficacy, it’s still better than baseline. Also, let’s be honest, you just acknowledged that the Covid vaccines are effective for at least six months. Maybe at least start with that?</p>

        <p>Side side note; sorry, been drinking. Both Moderna and Pfizer have still been holding pretty dang well past six months. Others, probably not, but to be honest, I never expected the others to do well in general. less than 70% immunity after vaccination just screams half-assed. But the main two are doing quite well. The only threat to them is new variants, which the unvaxxed pop is trying their hardest to cultivate.</p>

        <p>It’s my understanding that waning specific antibodies were found to lead to ADE - in the case of Dengue it was children who had already been infected - in the case of Zika it was those who had been vaccinated.  Don’t quote me on that - ya gotta look it up.  But I believe the theory is when you can’t in a sense destroy the virus via neutralizing antibodies, when the antibodies call in the backup forces of white blood cells, the white blood cells in turn end up ALSO getting infected - something like that anyway.  But yeah ADE is something I don’t think is fully understood yet in the uh, scientific community...so still a very viable theory and something they should be looking at closely with these vaccines</p>

        <p>Anything that offered the slightest bit of hope was instantly suppressed. Any treatment, any prophylactics, anything EXCEPT social distancing, lockdowns for everyone, masks for everyone, and then vaccines. They've done their best to funnel public opinion in that direction, and all these dumbasses are now reliably placing blame for the newest rise in cases onto the unvaccinated. They have every right to be angry, in my opinion, but are blaming all the wrong people.   Many of them think of themselves as free thinkers but ultimately place their trust in the media, including social media, I guess. If YouTube banned it, guess it must not be true, because surely they know what's best. Trying to talk to friends and family is like talking to people who've been hypnotized. Source material means nothing. It doesn't help that none of them read - they need videos. And videos get removed that might help them, which makes them seem suspicious to this type of person.</p>

<p>Yeah I remember the WHO asking for it's ban after a very sketchy and biased Harvard study was published. The findings of this so called "research" were massively spread worldwide and it had such a big influence even though it was retracted by the makers a few weeks after following the backlash they received from their peers.</p>

        <p>More recently, NAC (N-acetyl cysteine amino acid) was conveniently banned in the US around May 2021 because it was discovered in 2019 that it will detoxify the liver from graphene oxide, and we know what contains those nanoparticles. Luckily NAC is still available here in Canada for now.</p>

        <p>The CDC had plans in place to push MRNA vaccines pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>The CDC not only controls the healthcare response via their declarations but more importantly they along with the NIH control massive amounts of research funding.</p>
<p>If you are a research scientist relying on grants for your continued employment you are going to conduct research that the CDC wants you to conduct.</p>
<p>Basically the CDC controls the pandemic narrative, controls the response narrative, and has the financial clout to prevent research findings that contradicts the narrative and to create massive amounts of research findings that support their narrative.</p>
<p>It’s why most research scientists will privately say most of what we’ve been told the past year has no scientific basis but won’t say the same publicly.</p>

        <p>One angle is to look at the patent filings dating back to the early 2000's, another is to look the SPARS documents, yet another is to consider the public pronouncements of insiders in the years leading up to it.</p>
<p>The point is that all of this happened despite the case numbers being fudged by using PCR, the death numbers being deliberately exaggerated directly (by killing people through care-home policies) and indirectly via the with-from distinction. Whatever little excess mortality there may be can very easily be accounted for by the lockdown measures themselves with no need to have "novel virus" enter the discussion at all.</p>
<p>So the mRNA vax doesn't have to do anything. They may as well be using saline injections. They have already showed an unwillingness to properly measure anything, and then issued changing guidelines that made a distinction between vaccinated and unvaccinated cases.</p>
<p>That behavior says that the vaccines are a preplanned means-to-an-end that is not tied up to reality or empirical investigation. The story doesn't go: We have this new deadly disease, so we will develop a new vaccine to fight it. It goes: we want to mandate vaccines so we manipulate data to invent a disease and its cure regardless of whatever may actually be happening.</p>

        <p>If you watch the Dr. David Martin interview re the patent history he lays it out and quotes Peter Daszak saying they were planning on monetizing the MRNA vaccines in the next pandemic.</p>
<p>Daszak is a Fauci stooge.  </p>
<p>He works for Eco-Health Alliance.</p>
<p>Eco-Health Alliance was given a grant via Fauci’s NIH to do gain of function research at the Wuhan Lab after such research was banned in the US.</p>
<p>Daszak show’s up heavily in Fauci’s emails that were released and Daszak was given the task by Fauci to discredit the Wuhan Lab Leak theory.</p>

If they were inefficient, they either transmit disease (which they do) or kill you( they don't) but they have rare side effects which we know or don't know. However, I'm unaware of simply making variants, that's wild.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it is to enforce compliance for any follow up "booster" shot, or more precisely it is to enforce people to stay at "home" while they are non-compliant because getting a required booster will take half a year again. Of course compliance also means you need to be able to show your compliance which is what the app is for. When the infections go up again the proximity function of the app will be made mandatory so people will be arbitrarily forced to quarantine at home.</p>

        <p>Curious to see this. So much unethical vaccine involvements have been pushed on India (and Africa) in the past, no doubt they are resistant to this current thing. Polio vaccines and experimental HPV vaccines come to mine, via mostly Gates affiliated groups it seems. I can't believe I'm actually talking about Bill Gates vaccine shit, 2 years ago I would have scoffed at people who talk about these things until I actually read into it and was like...oh, shit.</p>

        <p>It is amazing though how deaths among the vaccinated are almost unheard of.  Why would the vaccinated give a shit about the unvaccinated?  It's almost as if the vaccinated have a pathological desire to prevent death, which is a natural occurrence that can't be prevented by anything.  Medical science is bullshit. All we've been doing is prolonging the inevitable. There has never been an immortal person so clearly medicine is fruitless.</p>

<p>Doctors who used antibiotics such as this one have had promising results with their patients. For example, prior bacterial infections especially in the lung could create favorable conditions for severe covid infections particularily in older patients. Read more about it here</p>

<p>Then everyone who want's to survive has to take the injections, if they are even permitted to have them at later point. But the close to 100% lethality would take years to develop propably.</p>
<p>How are the elites covered for this, they can keep themselves isolated from the flock safely or do they have some sort of medical solution in their back pockets?</p>

        <p>They don't care about research, logic, or basic principles of biology. The propaganda blitz has people all-in on the idea that unvaccinated people are somehow "growing" new variants inside them that are going to defeat the vaccine and kill everyone. </p>
<p>Facts don't matter. The sheep believe as they're told to believe and don't question.</p>

        <p>I think the main issue is and will become ADE. Having variants/stereotypes (like dengue, look it up) is going to fuck up both sides. Yes variants tend to be less lethal than the “OG,” but those who don’t get “enhanced boosters” will be more susceptible to their body <em>helping the variants enter cells to do their harm</em>. </p>
<p>This post might not be far off. It could literally be a slow process of making the vaccines essential, and the vaccines could be a way to turn a relatively harmless virus into something perpetual and of increasing threat. This would be simply by promoting the evolution of variants/stereotypes at an accelerated rate.</p>

        <p>I recommend reading the two articles I posted. Scientists theorized that "leaky" vaccines which aren't effective enough at preventing transmission but very good at reducing symptoms are the perfect breeding ground for more virulent viruses at it makes people less susceptible to their symptoms</p>

        <p>Sorry, it's just not greed. First off governments have guaranteed that they'll buy the vaccines so the FDA could revoke the EUA tomorrow and it wouldn't hurt vaccine sales. Second none of the other patented treatments, like remdesivir, are being pushed this way. They want the whole world vaccinated for some reason other than money or a good-faith belief that it's necessary for public health. All the remaining plausible explanations are terrifying.</p>

        <p>Remember a few months ago when more people were vaccinated and cases were down? Now that more and more people are becoming unvaccinated, cases are skyrocketing.

<p>Remember when a virus which is at it's strongest in winter suddenly became less threatening when summer came ? Yeah...</p>
<p>&rt;Now that more and more people are becoming unvaccinated</p>
<p>People don't become unvaccinated, people become vaccinated...yeah that was bit of a dumb statement. Especially if I rephrase it like this "Now that more and more people are getting vaccinated, cases are skyrocketing". Which is the truth, even though the term "skyrocketing is a complete exagerration".</p>
<p>But I'm sure that right now you're thinking "correlation doesn't equals causation". See the flaws in your thoughts now ?</p>

<p>Well it’s because of the unvaccinated. I said no it’s a political issue. She just shit up and left the room. </p>

        <p>You should take another look at that journal article. The data do not support the hypothesis of the vaccine causing the evolution of these extremely virulent strains of poultry virus. Vaccines, along with any other measures that keep an infected animal alive, allow for the deadly virus to persist in a population where it would otherwise be too deadly and naturally die off.</p>

        <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson, the only viral vector “vaccine” of the 3 available on America is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/cvs-health-stops-offering-jj-covid-vaccine-at-its-pharmacies-available-at-select-minuteclinics.html">almost entirely gone</a>.  Look at the CDC chart in that article comparing usage rates among the 3.  J &amp; J has been at almost literally 0 since May.  Moderna and Pfizer are the only ones relevant to the conversation anymore, and they are gene therapy mRna; no inactivated virus ever touches them.  </p>
<p>They are NOT intended to make you immune.  If they were, they are highly unsuccessful.  But they aren’t and even <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-theres-a-big-difference-between-a-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-person-testing-positive-for-covid-19#Providing-protection">their ministers admit this</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;    Doctors, however, aren’t surprised by the positive test results. They say vaccines don’t always keep a person from testing positive, but in almost all cases, they do prevent someone from becoming sick, or at least as ill as they would have without the vaccine</p>
<p>&rt;    “Vaccines mostly protect people from developing disease, not infection,” Gallagher said.</p>
<p>You can’t just redefine “vaccine” to fit a medication so that the social pressure of the word sells shots for you.  The word vaccine in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200516104515/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vaccine">May of 2020</a> meant </p>
<p>&rt;    a preparation of <strong>killed microorganisms</strong>, living attenuated organisms, or living fully virulent organisms that is administered to <strong>produce or artificially increase immunity</strong> to a particular disease</p>
<p>And yet just <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vaccine">a year later</a> it means</p>
<p>&rt;    a <strong>preparation</strong> that is administered (as by injection) to <strong>stimulate</strong> the body's immune response against a specific infectious agent or disease</p>
<p>Now please hand wave this away by saying “the science changed” or whatever.  This is an admission by the corporate doctors you worship that their medicines don’t work like they thought.</p>

        <p>Lol yes, the science changed. That's not handwaving, that's just fact. Hell, the first definition you posted isn't even sufficient to describe diphtheria and tetanus vaccines, which are much older than Covid. Those are made from toxoids, which are produced by microorganisms, sure, but also are not preparations <em>of</em> microorganisms. Honestly, I'm surprised that shitty definition stayed up as long as it did. What do we do when definitions of words are no longer sufficient? We improve them to better fit changing understanding. That's not some conspiracy, it's just how science works.</p>
<p>You think you're far more intelligent than you are, and it prevents you from seeing basic facts.</p>

        <p>No, that’s how marketing works. There’s a reason the new compounds must be called “vaccines” despite doing nothing that fits the original definition. You think you are so enlightened because you are afraid and desperate and someone’s said “Science changes!  We weren’t wrong!”  You’re just another Bill Nye quietly editing his old episodes, removing references to chromosomes, all for Netflix to agree he is science enough before publication.</p>

        <p>Yeah, whenever a new type of vaccine shows up, the definition needs to change. It’s revolutionary, which is cool. Once again, you think this is a conspiracy, when really it’s just a new type that doesn’t immediately conform completely to the previous definition, so the definition was changed to compensate. Again, that’s science. Your lack of understanding doesn’t change facts.</p>

        <p>Please let me try to refute your claims. </p>
<p>1)</p>
<p>You don't need 100% of the population to be vaccinated for a vaccine program to be successful. You just need to achieve herd immunity which can be at different levels for different diseases. Or even different levels for the same disease but in different scenarios, such as urban vs rural.</p>
<p>This can be 90% or 80% or 70% or 60%. I don't know who these people are that are arguing for 100% vaccinated but they are in the wrong. Your counter arguments to the claim that 100% need to be vaccinated are off-point. </p>
<p>2) </p>
<p>&rt;Here's what the CDC director recently had to say about the covid vaccines : “They continue to work well for Delta, with regard to severe illness and death – they prevent it. But what they can't do anymore is prevent transmission.” </p>
<p>You are missing a very important element here. You are correct that they do not prevent transmission, but this says nothing about how they reduce the likelihood of transmission. </p>
<p>I think there is a misinterpretation here. When they say that they can't prevent transmission, they don't mean that there is zero prevention taking place. They mean that they can't fully stop all cases of transmission. The articles you linked to talk about perfect vaccines. And these vaccines are imperfect. Imperfect means they don't work 100% at stopping transmissions, but that they are able to do it to a degree.</p>
<p>So they do reduce the likelihood of a transmission. If this reduction in the likelihood of transmission coupled with a specific amount of people in the population having this reduction transmission level (vaccinated), then this may bring the R value below 1, and thus infections will dissipate.</p>
<p>3)</p>
<p>I don't know too much about leaky vaccines, and I was learning from the articles you linked to, but I think these were saying something different to what you're saying. </p>
<p>It's not saying that vaccines create the potential for the disease to mutate into a worse disease. </p>
<p>Its saying that in the example diseases, vaccinated individuals can act as transmitters only. Transmitting deadlier variants to unvaccinated individuals. </p>
<p>Imagine a football stadium full of vaccinated people. But 10 people in the crowd including you are unvaccinated. Then, a deadly variant of covid is introduced to the crowd with a 90% kill rate. Well, all the vaccinated people are safe, but because the vaccine is imperfect, they are able to transmit the disease on. So everybody ends up getting it, all the vaccinated people are fine, but 9 of the unvaccinated people die.</p>
<p>The article is saying that this is different from normal. Normally if a disease mutates to have a 90% kill rate, it kills too many of its hosts to spread. So it shuts itself down. Imperfect vaccines keep these diseases from shutting down, but also protect vaccinated individuals. That's why the article says “these results are actually an argument for getting the vaccine,”</p>
<p>Also when you say</p>
<p>&rt;mass vaccinating during a pandemic is not only foolish but dangerous</p>
<p>you're talking as if the consequences of leaky vaccines are inevitable. However the article also says</p>
<p>"the Salk polio vaccine—one of two that are used—is a little leaky. “People who are immunized can be infected with poliovirus and the virus can replicate in their guts, be shed, and transmitted to others,” says Racaniello. “This behaviour has been well documented in human populations, yet the virulence of poliovirus has not increased for the 50+ years during which this vaccine has been used.”</p>
<p>So it sounds like its saying, that the consequences of leaky vaccines are physically possible, but extremely rare.</p>
<p>4)</p>
<p>And just to mention, its perfectly possible that the example animal vaccines may be reducing transmission likelihood form say 80% to 76%, and this would be classed as imperfect. But the covid vaccines could be reducing transmission likelihood from say 90% to 12% and also be classed as imperfect. But these are two completely different situations.</p>

        <p>What is everyone's opinion on the Novavax Vaccine being created in Montreal? It seems like it might be very promising. The technology for making it is definately more proven than the Mrna vaccines. I might just get that to avoid all of the toxicity I know I will recieve just by saying im not vaccinated. Our bodies, our choice of course, but I am just curious on your opinions.</p>

        <p>Look dude, I understand all of the confusion in everything here. But biology is a bit more complicated that just simple extrapolation. What occurs in chickens is not necessarily analogous to humans. This is for the same reason many of the "miracle" cancer treatments for mice haven't been made for humans. Biology at the base level is highly conserved and most living things are guided by the same mechanisms, but not all of those pathways and mechanisms align in the same way or function together. In the article you linked, the lead researcher even says it doesn't apply to most human vaccines. Additionally, in the research paper, they state "Our data do not demonstrate that vaccination was responsible for the evolution of hyperpathogenic strains of MDV."</p>
<p>Now of course, the stipulation there is "most." Could the COVID vaccine be at risk for this? Well, yes. Now. The CDC director said "But what they can't do <strong>anymore</strong> is prevent transmission.” The vaccines were initially developed by BioNTech to reduce both symptoms and transmission, and many still are perfectly capable of reducing transmission. However, several variants of COVID have since developed that are capable of transmission even with the vaccine because not enough people were safe with COVID to begin with. We don't have nearly the number of doses required for herd immunity. Even though COVID cases began to fall shortly after vaccine rollout, those who remained unvaccinated or unsafe and caught COVID and other variants allow for the virus to fester for longer and mutate. But regardless, any concern about "leaky" vaccines just means that we need to develop better vaccines than the ones we have now. Leading to my next point.</p>
<p>Are the current vaccines perfect? No, and if you don't want to get them then that's your decision. But that doesn't give an excuse to act as if you are intentionally trying to spread the virus. The issue with many people who are unvaccinated is that they do nothing to protect themselves or others. And this is the issue with Biden's "honor system" policy for opening up. There's no way to ensure that people are actually being safe with COVID since they can just say they're vaccinated when they aren't and just carry on with their lives and spread the virus. There are plenty of precautions you can take to not get the virus without the vaccine, I've never caught the virus because I practice the proper safety precautions. (hell, I haven't even been sick since the beginning of all of this. Goes to show how sick other people get you in general).</p>
<p>Of course, if anyone reads this and just believes that the virus is fake, the data is fake, or this is all a government plot to control us then I don't know why you read this far since you're clearly not interested in having a real conversation about saving lives. If they are trying to control us with a manufactured virus, then they did a pretty shitty job about it by having it spread worldwide and Trump would be to blame since he did essentially nothing to prevent the spread of the virus for the first few months. He could've and should've done more for us.</p>

        <p>Okay, there's a ton of bad stuff here, but aside from that, the issue is that you're posting this in an echo chamber. You're not looking for an argument; you're trying to confirm your biases. You're wanting to find comfort from other idiots that your misinformation is real. However, I did find a few things so hilariously wrong that I will address them for funsies.</p>
<p>Azithromycin for Covid? Really? Literally no one prescribes that for Covid. It's a frigging antibacterial with a mechanism of action that would do absolutely nothing for Covid. Maybe used prophylactically to prevent a co-infection with opportunistic bacteria, but Covid would still easily wreck your lungs if you took this. HQC and ivermectin have both had plenty of research detailing how they don't improve patient outcomes, but y'all are in an echo chamber feeding into each others' delusions, so I'm not surprised you're still months behind on that info. As for zinc, eh, it might help a bit with symptoms, and might slightly improve outcomes, but it still ain't gonna do dick compared to just taking the vaccine. You kinda just put your medical ignorance out there for the whole world to see with this.</p>
<p>Blaming vaccines and the people who take them on viral mutations is one of the most pathetic attempts at a "no u" I've ever seen. Regardless of "leakiness" (btw, I find it hilarious that every article doomsaying leaky vaccines can only ever point to one example in chickens), vaccinated people are still far less likely to produce mutated viruses than unvaccinated, due to the amount of replication that the virus can undergo before the immune system catches it. If you really think vaccines are more likely to produce virulent strains than the sheer quantity of unvaccinated idiots, I would love to play poker with you, because you clearly have no understanding of basic probability.</p>
<p>And yes, we could get upwards of 80% of the population vaccinated if people like you would stop fighting us with terrible science and misinformation every step of the way. It's how we eradicated smallpox and nearly eradicated polio in the US, after all. </p>
<p>You are at least right that people have become more polarized. Thing is, you're tragically lacking in self-awareness by not realizing that by spreading this misinformation only serves to divide people further. Congrats for perpetuating the cycle.</p>
<p>BTW, if you're so worried about transmission, maybe wear a mask and encourage others to do so? Oh, right, remembered that this sub is dedicated to making sure this virus lasts as long as possible.</p>

        <p>What is a vaccine in everyone's mind? A way to develop an immune response prior to actually getting infected with a disease. All that changed in the definition is what specifically caused that immune response.</p>
<p>The definition changed from "oganisms" being administered to "preparation of genetic material'. Definitions for words change on a frequent basis. Due to the fact that we have a new type of vaccine that operates differently from previously developed vaccines doesnt mean it isnt a vaccine. Thats why you have a definition change, because it now isnt solely the introduction of an organism. But it still develops an immune response so therefore still a vaccine.</p>

        <p>Affected means it affects you in some way. You can be infected and not be affected by it. Its the same reason why you morons go on about that fake 99% rate that has no basis in anything. You go on about it because it's saying "generally no one is affected by it so why get a vaccine for something that doesn't affect most people". They are still infected but not affected. And then you say "the vaccine isn't a vaccine because it doesnt actually make you immune because you can still get infected, even though it doesnt affect you". So either being infected affects you or it doesn't, you cNt have it both ways.
All anyone needs to do is let you lot just keep talking until you contradict yourself.</p>

        <p>It doesnt need to contain dead covid because of breakthrough in technology. Before they were dead virus we introduced live virus. So because of that is the dead virus vaccine not a true vaccine because it isnt the same as the original?</p>

<p>https://www.dictionary.com/e/vaccinate-vs-inoculate-vs-immunize/</p>
<p>&rt;    Inoculate means “to implant (a disease agent or antigen) in a person, animal, or plant to produce a disease for study or to stimulate disease resistance.” More generally, inoculate means to implant a microorganism (such as a bacteria, virus, or amoeba) into an environment. The noun form of inoculate is inoculation.</p>
<p>&rt;    Of the three words, <strong>vaccinate</strong> is the most narrow because it specifically means to give a vaccine to someone. <strong>Inoculate</strong> is more general and can mean to implant a virus</p>
<p>You’ve confused inoculation (introducing a live virus) with vaccination (introducing a deactivated, modified form of a virus).</p>

<p>"Vaccinate is the most specific of the three terms, because it always involves introducing a vaccine, which usually consists of a small amount of a killed, weakened, or otherwise modified version of a disease (such as a virus or bacterium). "Key word in their is weakened, so still live.</p>
<p>"While inoculate has other meanings outside the context of medicine, in modern healthcare it’s typically used interchangeably with vaccinate (though it’s used less commonly)."</p>

        <p>You skipped the part where it said “inoculate” is only used to sometimes mean ‘vaccinate’ because vaccines don’t include live viruses anymore, so there isn’t any other use of the word “inoculate” that makes sense in conversation. </p>

<p>First of all those vaccines were very efficient at preventing transmission and even then, small pox or polio weren't eradicated the year after the total had reached 100%. Oh no it took a few more years and epidemics before it was over.</p>

        <p>That’s because those are vaccines. This Covid “vaccine” isn’t a vaccine. You can still get sick and spread it. This means that the virus can actually evolve into much more potent and dangerous virus. This doesn’t happen with the aforementioned vaccines and this also doesn’t happen with people with natural antibodies. </p>
<p>The vaccine rollout is one big fuckup. And we’re just at the beginning. This shit is gonna get an awful lot worse. And that’s all because of these so called vaccines.</p>

        <p>One of the betters arguments against forced vaccination with experimental medical treatments has to do with historically known side effects from previous attempts at mRNA vaccinations, which all failed.</p>
<p>The papers below share about historically known adverse side effects from attempts at mRNA vaccination that were SUPPOSED to be addressed before experimenting on large portions of the population. It's ironic how all the adverse side effects being reported JUST HAPPEN to be the same side effects that medical journals were warning about BEFORE the pandemic. </p>
<p>Sources:</p>
<p>• “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243">mRNA vaccines — a new era in vaccinology</a>,” a study less than two years old at the time of the outbreak.</p>
<p>• “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5987916/">Nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines induce potent T follicular helper and germinal center B cell responses</a>” from summer of 2018</p>
<p>• “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6631684/">A Comparison of Plasmid DNA and mRNA as Vaccine Technologies</a>” , one of the most recent major pre-COVID medical studies about this published in June 2019, and provides a clear overview of vaccines technologies as recent as six months prior to the first SARS-CoV-2 case.</p>
<p>Selections from the above sources:</p>
<p>• Ex vivo mRNA cancer treatment are the only mRNA treatments that have been effective in the past, and as of 2019, scientists had not figured out how to make in vitro mRNA prophylactic treatments (the current vaccines) effective or without safety concerns. </p>
<p>• Direct injection of mRNA is comparatively rapid and cost-effective, but it does not yet allow precise and efficient cell-type-specific delivery.</p>
<p>• The majority of past investigations focused on DNA-based vaccines because of concerns about mRNA instability and the inefficiency of in vitro delivery.</p>
<p>• The instability of mRNA has been a significant reason for the lack of interest in mRNA as a drug in the past.</p>
<p>• mRNA vaccines are inflammatory in nature which increases risk for toxicity.</p>
<p>• A possible concern is that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce responses which have been associated not only with inflammation but also with autoimmunity.</p>
<p>• mRNA inhibition of antigen can have negative immune responses.</p>
<p>• The immune system response has the potential to be harmful – RNA has long been known to be an immunologically active molecule, and mRNA has a number of immunostimulatory mechanisms, which may be detrimental for mRNA used for vaccines.</p>
<p>• Recent human trials (pre COVID) have demonstrated both moderate and severe injection site or systemic reactions for different mRNA platforms. </p>
<p>• While some preclinical studies have generated optimism about the prospects and advantages of mRNA-based vaccines, two of the more recent clinical reports led to more tempered expectations. In both trials, immunogenicity was more modest in humans than was expected based on animal models, and the side effects were not trivial.</p>
<p>• Liver toxicity was observed in pre-clinical studies with one potential mRNA therapeutic delivered in lipid nanoparticles for Crigler-Najjar syndrome… These were serious enough to halt the work with this particular entity.</p>
<p>• This observed toxicity may be concerning for vaccines as well, since even live replicating viruses and viral vector vaccines (which generally are more immunogenic than subunit vaccines) need repeat dosing</p>
<p>• There were reported toxicities seen with the rabies mRNA vaccine that included limited systemic adverse effects (AEs) for the majority of patients (78%) and even grade three AEs in ~10% of patients following doses of mRNA via different routes. This was despite the conclusions from early studies showing that this vaccine was generally thought to be safe.</p>
<p>• Known potential safety concerns that have been identified as needing to be evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies (as of six months before the first case of COVID) include: </p>
<p>• local and systemic inflammation</p>
<p>• the biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen</p>
<p>• stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies </p>
<p>• potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components.</p>
<p>• Another potential safety issue derives from the presence of extracellular RNA during mRNA vaccination, which has been shown to contribute to oedema [oedema is “excessive accumulation of fluid, mainly water, in the tissue spaces of the body”]</p>
<p>• Another study showed that extracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation and pathological thrombus formation [blood clots]</p>
<p>• There are nine areas that scientists have noted need continued research and development for mRNA vaccines, as well as nine “Issues to be addressed for clinical efficacy and safety of mRNA related to inflammation,” including:</p>
<p>• “Potential toxicity of mRNA due to inherent mRNA inflammatory activity, use of unnatural modified nucleoside, and the formulations;</p>
<p>• “Several pathways of RNA-induced inflammation: TLR 3, 7, 8, plus cytoplasmic pathways</p>
<p>• “Known toxicities of drugs containing unnatural modified nucleosides</p>
<p>• “Potential mitigation or enhancement due to formulation of the mRNA</p>
<p>• “Will anti-self RNA antibodies be generated and play any role in autoimmune diseases?</p>
<p>• “Design of clinical trials to detect inflammation/toxicity due to mRNA”</p>
<p>The general conclusion of all these studies?</p>
<p>"Safety will therefore need continued evaluation as different mRNA modalities and delivery systems are utilized for the first time in humans and are tested in larger patient populations.”</p>
<p>Most studies that have been done have been to show that the vaccines are effective compared to not having a vaccine. I've looked and found hardly any research proving the safety of the vaccines, and most of the safety reports that have been provided are from the manufacturer to the FDA, so it would require FOIA requests to access.</p>

        <p>The problem is that it's not ONLY about death. To be clear: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No one is seeking to discount that there have been promising and tangible developments in mRNA vaccines over recent years. The question is whether enough historical safety concerns have been solved in these jabs to apply indiscriminately across the entire population. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is not only long-term effects, but understanding which populations have any adverse effect and WHY, which we don’t know. </p>

<p>This argument is not to try to prevent other people from taking the vaccine, but defending people’s right to opt out. Especially young and healthy individuals with almost no risk from covid. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arguing that any medical treatment be forced on someone puts the burden of proof on the coercing party to provide evidence of safety; it should be enough that a person has the right to deny any medical treatment, so “reasonable doubt” is more than enough reason to refuse, especially with the lack of safety data. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As of 2016, no lipid nano particle-mRNA (LNP) vaccines had ever been tested in humans because of “unanswered questions,” and also because--this is important--<strong>the tolerance for side effects in healthy individuals is very low.</strong> In other words, with cancer patients who are already dying, doctors will do more experimental treatments to try to save a life, but they don't want to put an already healthy person at greater risk. Note that the corona vaccines have mRNA wrapped in LNP in order to deliver the code through the body’s defenses. </p>
<p>From the 2016 study "mRNA vaccine delivery using lipid nanoparticles"
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439223/): </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Currently, no mRNA therapeutic is approved for use in humans, and <strong>a beneficial safety profile in patients still has to be demonstrated.</strong> A first clinical application will likely not be a prophylactic vaccine, <strong>because the tolerance for side effects is very low for a drug that is injected into healthy individuals.</strong> Establishing the safety profile in a therapeutic application, such as cancer immunotherapy, will be followed by prophylactic applications.” </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Currently, no LNP [Lipid Nano Particles]–mRNA vaccine has been tested in patients, because there are still a number of unanswered questions.” </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, from CDC safety and effectiveness standard guidelines (https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download): </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Data from studies in animal models administered certain vaccine constructs against other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) have raised concerns of a theoretical risk for <strong>COVID-19 vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (ERD)</strong>. In these studies, animal models were administered vaccine constructs against other coronaviruses and <strong>subsequently challenged with the respective wild-type virus.</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"These studies have shown evidence of <strong>immunopathologic lung reactions</strong> characteristic of a Th-2 type hypersensitivity similar to ERD described in infants and animals that were administered formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine and that were subsequently challenged with RSV virus due to natural exposure or in the laboratory, respectively (Refs. 4-9). <strong>Vaccine candidates should be assessed in light of these studies.</strong>" </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"A. General Considerations. <strong>As with all licensed vaccines, there can be limitations in the safety database accrued from the pre-licensure clinical studies of a COVID-19 vaccine.</strong> For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"The number of subjects receiving a COVID-19 vaccine in pre-licensure clinical studies may not be adequate to detect some adverse reactions that may occur infrequently. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Pre-licensure safety data in some subpopulations likely to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (e.g., pregnant individuals, or individuals with medical comorbidities) may be limited at the time of licensure. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[Note that I have not been able to find any publicly released safety studies for pregnant women, comorbidities, or in individuals who have already survived the virus. If you have any data on this please share!] </p>
<ul>
<li>"For some COVID-19 vaccines, <strong>the safety follow-up period to monitor for possible vaccine-associated ERD (vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease) and other adverse reactions may not have been completed</strong> for all subjects enrolled in pre-licensure clinical studies before the vaccine is licensed." </li>
</ul>
<p>Even the CDC safety guidelines note that we haven't been able to test for everything and we don't know how the vaccine will react in many populations. </p>
<p>Additionally, certain vaccines may not be recommended for people with certain pre-existing conditions, even though it's recommended for the larger population. For example, the Pfizer fact sheet (https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download) says people who "had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of this vaccine" should NOT take the vaccine, which could include people with allergies to Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) (which are included in the lipids). This is why it is critical for EVERYONE to consult their doctor before getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>Furthermore, most of the issues listed in those studies create much higher risk for death, like blood clots and cytokine storms. </p>
<p>All these peer-reviewed and well-cited medical studies are evidence as to why people should be skeptical. The thousands of vaccine-related deaths and adverse effects are evidence that the vaccines are not as safe as claimed. The recent announcement from the CDC is evidence that the vaccines are ineffective. </p>
<p>When has there ever been a vaccine that only reduces severity of symptoms? Is that even a vaccine anymore? The people who get it carry as much of the virus and are just as likely to spread it, and there have still been breakthrough infections and deaths (which are either from the vaccine failing or the vaccine causing immunogenicity issues so the recipients natural defenses are compromised). </p>
<p>I had covid already, it was a nasty two weeks, but no hospital or prescriptions needed. All self-treated at home.. So why should I take an ineffective and unsafe vaccine for a disease I've already survived and created natural antibodies for? Especially when animals being tested on had permanent lung damage after being re-exposed to the wild virus? </p>
<p>If you want to blame someone, blame the vaccine manufacturers for not doing enough to combat vaccine hesitancy.
If the vaccine manufacturers took on the liability for this treatment and provided a 10-15 year statue of limitations (instead of the one year SOL from the CICP), then more people would consider it. If vaccine manufacturers validated their science by actually putting their money behind their claims, we'd see a greater willingness to get this new treatment (Pfizer alone has made billions in profit, so they can afford to). But if they don't trust their own science enough to accept liability, then I'm not going to accept that liability for them. Especially for a treatment where all the new evidence that's come out shows its less effective and less safe than originally thought.</p>

        <p>I didn’t hear that from anyone, that’s the conclusion I came to myself. Not only that, but we even cut production and manpower in the military once the virus first broke out. If this is some big conspiracy to control people, I don’t think they’d sacrifice the money they’d make from the military industrial complex for this.

        <p>Polio outbreaks increased in the 1940s, yet the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/what-is-polio/polio-us.html">CDC page on Polio</a> reports that the first polio vaccine was available in 1955, but Polio wasn't eradicated from the US until 1979. This is with different versions of the vaccine (like IPV and OPV) as the treatment was improved with research and development over time. That's a 30 year timeline.</p>
<p>Plus, the rollout was not without safety concerns, as the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/concerns-history.html">CDC notes</a>.</p>
<p>"In 1955, some batches of polio vaccine given to the public contained live polio virus, even though they had passed required safety testing. Over 250 cases of polio were attributed to vaccines produced by one company: Cutter Laboratories. This case, which came to be known as the Cutter Incident, resulted in many cases of paralysis. The vaccine was recalled as soon as cases of polio were detected.</p>
<p>"The Cutter Incident was a defining moment in the history of vaccine manufacturing and government oversight of vaccines, and led to the creation of a better system of regulating vaccines.  After the government improved this process and increased oversight, polio vaccinations resumed in the fall of 1955."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1383764/">This medical journal</a> notes how the Incident above led to more use of OPV Polio vaccines, which, while it:</p>
<p>"had the advantages of being administered orally and of fostering wider `contact immunity', it could also be re-activated by passage through the gut, resulting in occasional cases of polio (still causing paralysis in six to eight children every year in the 1980s and 1990s, when a modified Salk vaccine was re-introduced)."</p>
<p>To think a disease can be eradicated in only a few years from a vaccine is optimistic but not well supported by history or science.</p>

        <p>One of your main points here is that the vaccines aren't helping with transmission of the virus, only symptoms. You entirely ignored the fact that between December and now the cases and hospitalizations have dropped dramatically (in the U.S). This peak is so much smaller than previously because of vaccinations. And even if they didn't help with transmission, reducing the symptoms to the point where way fewer people are dying helps too. Most of the people in hospitals right now aren't vaccinated. Most of the people dying aren't vaccinated. This simple fact alone should disprove your entire claim. Maybe use some logic next time if you want people to agree.</p>

<p>Correlation =/= causation</p>
<p>I also find it very intellectually dishonest to compare the spike from early 2020 (beginning of the epidemic) to what we saw in 2021. For example, you completely ignored the pre-existing natural immunity and the fact that health services actually know how to handle this disease now. </p>
<p>&rt;And even if they didn't help with transmission, reducing the symptoms to the point where way fewer people are dying helps too</p>
<p>The number of deaths isn't high in the first place, mortality worldwide hasn't risen in a significant way at all. I also believe that vaccinating people who aren't at risk with an experimental technology with no long term safety data even though there is a 99,7% survival rate for that group is dangerous and irresponsible. I also explained why in my post.</p>
<p>&rt;Maybe use some logic next time if you want people to agree.</p>

        <p>Ok. Then what caused the decrease in cases? Did they just magically start going down? Correlation =/= causation is only an argument used when the two things have no relation to each other. A vaccine and it's disease are VERY clearly related to each other. You also mentioned natural immunity, but both you and I know that there weren't enough with natural immunity to actually decrease the cases that much, that fast. </p>
<p>The point of vaccinating a group with a high survival rate isn't to protect them, it's to protect the people they can spread it to. Mainly people who have auto immune disorders and can't get the vaccine. But still, covid for those groups have a 99.7% survival rate (I haven't checked this number idk if it's right or not, especially with the new delta) the vaccine has a 99.999% survival rate. It has essentially killed no one. The only one to actually die from a vaccine was one person who got a blood clot from J&amp;J. They pulled it immediately after only one person died. It just seems foolish to trust covid over this vaccine.</p>
<p>Don't act like you weren't being condescending in your original post. "Can anyone try to refute this" comes of as (even if unintentionally) cocky and arrogant. And calling people who are just concerned for others 'doomers' doesn't help. I understand that you may not have tried to come across as an asshole, but that's the way I read it. If you truly just wanted to talk, sorry that I misunderstood.</p>

        <p>&rt;No, unvaccinated people are not the reason why we're still in this. They never were.</p>
<p>They ALWAYS were one huge reason we’re still in this. They are why it happened in the first place. If everyone had been vaccinated before the virus had emerged, it wouldn’t have spread and ended up killing millions. It’s just that no one had access to a vaccine back then, and now many people do. This is basic logic that is true of every deadly virus.</p>
<p>&rt;This seems increasingly harder to accept for doomers all around the world simply because that's what they've been repeatedly told by the media.</p>
<p>Sometimes the media is just reporting facts.</p>
<p>&rt;After all aren't unvaccinated people the perfect scapegoats ? It's so much easier to blame them than to start questionning the media and the government. The cold hard truth that we live in a world much darker than we think, that is ruled and controlled by evil people that only care about money and power...not you, is very hard to accept for the average person.</p>
<p>It’s easy to blame you because the risk of vaccination is so much lower to you than the risk you’re putting everyone around you in.  It’s selfish and ignorant to unnecessarily put everyone around you at risk of a deadly virus because you’re afraid of science or have a fear of needles. Get with the program.</p>
<p>&rt;This propaganda campaign aimed at unvaccinated people is meant to divide.</p>
<p>No, it’s meant to encourage you morons to get a clue and do your part, to do the right thing by everyone around you.</p>
<p>&rt;That is because if people are busy fighting against each other then their attention will be diverted from the real ennemy. An united population is what scares the ruling class, because they are the bringer of change.</p>
<p>🙄</p>
<p>&rt;Did you notice that over the years people got more and more polarized, especially on social media ? Yeah this has been going on way before covid.</p>
<p>A daily dose of the Facebook propaganda echo chamber will do that to you. Radicalizes people through algorithm-enhanced disinformation, a bit like this sub does. Pretty soon you have people thinking they know better than epidemiologists and infectious disease experts about epidemiology and infectious diseases.</p>
<p>&rt;Going back on topic. People have been fed a lot of lies that we need to debunk.</p>
<p>&rt;First of, people naively believe that if 100% of the population get vaccinated the virus will magically disappear. That's not how it works and it never work that way. </p>
<p>This is still possible, but not with the current slew of vaccines. I do not think there are many people who believe this. This is your perception of what they believe, and it is divergent from reality here.</p>
<p>&rt;Vaccinating close to 100% of the population, hell even more than 80% is absolutely impossible unless you're willing to go full Gestapo mode and send the army to force people to take the jab</p>
<p>Don’t need 100%, and no one ever said we did. This is what “herd immunity” refers to. The number changes based on the R0 value of the virus, the number of people infected on average by individual carriers of the virus. The bad news here is the delta variant has raised the R0 from transmission from ~2 to anywhere from 5 to 9. This means it’s a whole lot more infectious and if you aren’t vaccinated you’re more likely than ever to catch and spread it, leaving a trail of death and disease in your wake, even (and especially)  if you get through with an asymptomatic case (more likely symptomatic, though).</p>
<p>&rt;But let's assume 100% of the population gets vaccinated, why do you expect vaccines that were primarily made to reduce symptoms, not transmission, to be enough to make an incredibly resilient virus disappear ?</p>
<p>All vaccines are primarily made to reduce symptoms and stop transmission. It’s just a matter of how effective they are at doing that.</p>
<p>Fact of the matter is, they are <strong>largely the same goal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reducing symptoms reduces transmission.</strong></p>
<p>If you take a vaccine and get a breakthrough case, the window during which you are infectious is smaller. A smaller window makes transmission less likely to occur. In other words, you’re more likely to infect more people if you’re shedding the virus for 2 weeks than you are if you’re shedding it for just 3 days. This is basic logic.  500 cases a day is better than 1000. 250 is better than 500.</p>

        <p>&rt;Here's what the CDC director recently had to say about the covid vaccines : “They continue to work well for Delta, with regard to severe illness and death – they prevent it. But what they can't do anymore is prevent transmission.” 
Source : https://web.archive.org/web/20210805232759/https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-08-05-21/h_d2accec79fdc37f422d02c536828ea1e</p>
<p>&rt;All of this is not even accounting for the fact that mass vaccinating during a pandemic is not only foolish but dangerous. Why ? Because "leaky" vaccines that aren't efficient enough at preventing transmission are the perfect breeding ground for more virulent variants.
&rt;Don't believe me ? That's fine, here's some research paper on the subject : https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002198</p>
<p>From the paper you cited: “Thus, the use of leaky vaccines can facilitate the evolution of pathogen strains that put unvaccinated hosts at greater risk of severe disease.”</p>
<p>More evidence is required to claim this is the case with SARS-CoV2, as viruses are not all built the same, but assuming it is, then it sounds like you all need to get with the program, because everyone else is on board.</p>
<p>If these “leaky vaccines” prove to produce more virulent strains, that’s a problem for everyone, but much more so for the unvaccinated. And guess what: it’s not going to stop everyone else from getting vaccinated, either. You will be left behind to face a more virulent strain of the virus that’s even more likely to put you in the ICU or kill you.</p>
<p>&rt;It was used as a reference for this interesting article : https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/leaky-vaccines-enhance-spread-of-deadlier-chicken-viruses</p>
<p>&rt;So what can we do against covid is those experimental vaccines won't cut it ?</p>
<p>They will cut it better than nothing. And we will produce more effective vaccines in the future. We’ve been doing this for hundreds of years now. Viruses are an ongoing, evolving threat.</p>
<p>&rt;Well, how about we actually start treating people that are infected with covid ?</p>
<p>You don’t think we have been? Medical workers have been on the front lines of this pandemic since day 1, doing whatever they can to treat this. Just as we have EUAs for vaccines, so too do we have EUAs for shit like monoclonal antibodies, bablanivimab, tocilizumab, etc.</p>
<p>Just because whatever pet drug you think should be on the market like hydroxychloraquine or whatever buzzwordy “big pharma doesn’t want you to know about X!” garbage does <strong>NOT</strong> mean that it has been proven effective at doing anything other than giving you unnecessary side effects. This is why we do clinical trials.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the fact of the matter is that the best and most effective form of medicine is <strong>PREVENTION.</strong> It’s great if we know how to fix it after the fact, but it’s better to never break it in the first place. Vaccines are a means of prevention and they are correctly the first and foremost focus.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm still baffled that some of you believe that the government actually cares about saving lives when their response to the pandemic is "oh you got covid ? Sorry we're not going to do anything about it, just stay home and hopefully it doesn't get too bad to the point where you have to get to the hospital".</p>
<p>Oh you have a highly infectious disease that kills 1 out of every 50 people? STAY THE FUCK HOME UNTIL YOU AREN’T SICK ANYMORE UNTIL YOU THINK YOU MAY DIE WITHOUT MEDICAL INTERVENTION.</p>
<p>&rt;There are tons of effective treatments against covid. Hqc, ivermectin, azithromycin, zinc and so many other. Medecine that we know is safe because they've all been FDA approved and used for decades. Unlike you dear vaccines whose long term side effects are still unknown to this day. </p>
<p>See I didn’t even get to this paragraph before I wrote about HCQ up there, because I could tell it was coming, and sure enough..</p>
<p>Medicine usage is a risk/benefit trade off. If you can show the benefit of taking it is greater than the risk of not taking it, great, you can call the medicine “safe” for that purpose. The benefit of taking a drug that has proven highly effective in preventing malaria in a foreign land, for example, outweighs the risk of HCQ’s potential side effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>difficulty reading or seeing (words, letters, or parts of objects missing)</li>
<li>sensitivity to light</li>
<li>blurred vision</li>
<li>changes in vision</li>
<li>seeing light flashes or streaks</li>
<li>difficulty hearing</li>
<li>ringing in ears</li>
<li>muscle weakness</li>
<li>unusual bleeding or bruising</li>
<li>bleaching or loss of hair</li>
<li>mood or mental changes</li>
<li>irregular heartbeat</li>
<li>drowsiness</li>
<li>convulsions</li>
<li>decreased consciousness or loss of consciousness</li>
<li>thinking about harming or killing yourself</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with taking HCQ as a treatment against COVID is that the evidence of its efficacy against COVID is not clear. You don’t have proof that you’re doing anything other than putting yourself at risk of these side effects. The risk/benefit trade off is almost entirely on risk. You might as well try radiation therapy like they give to cancer patients, maybe it’ll help. Of course you won’t, because the side effects are much more clear. But the benefit is just as unclear an unproven. This is why it’s not a safe treatment.</p>
<p>And the thing is, let’s say I’m wrong and it IS a safe treatment. If you don’t have the evidence that it’s effective in treating COVID, you are still being irresponsible by prescribing it for COVID. And if it is safe and it is proven to work? Guess what: WE PUT IT ON THE MARKET AND AUTHORIZE ITS USE.</p>
<p>It is truly astounding that the same people who are wholeheartedly ready to hop on the unproven and risky HCQ train just because it was pushed by media and political figures, are at the same time hiding in fear of vaccines that have been proven highly effective and low-risk, with 2 of them over 90% effective at preventing severe disease. It is peak idiocy that shows the power of propaganda to improperly influence a population with a severe lack of understanding of science and evidence-based medicine.</p>

<p>Nice post, and for what it’s worth, the data in the article don’t even suggest that this is the case in the poultry virus being studied. So much of this sub is people reading one line from a journal article, misunderstanding it, and citing it to support their ideologically driven views on COVID.</p>

        <p>It’s like… especially the HCQ, ivermectin, etc., stuff, when paired with the anti-vaccine stuff.</p>
<p>I actually predicted long ago that these same people who were pushing politicized, unproven, and risky meds in the early days of the pandemic would be the same ones in fear and skeptical of clinically-proven-safe-and-effective vaccines. It makes me laugh every time I see someone do it in the same post, like this one, because it’s so revealing of their lack of understanding.</p>
<p>And yeah, I’m skeptical of the study, I’ll wait til it’s definitive and specifically on SARS-CoV2. The selection pressure on the virus is never toward more virulence (although it’s certainly possible to become more virulent), only toward more transmissibility, and a virus which evades vaccines would have much more selection pressure than one that is more virulent in general. Of course, it’s about transmission, so a virus that mutates to be both more virulent in general AND that can evade the vaccine is always possible.</p>

        <p>YES YOU ARE. The vaccines are a 100 percent safe. Only 6 people have had blood clots from the vaccine out of 100s of millions of people. Yet here you are, the ones who are being brainwashed, saying that people who are doing the right thing by getting a vaccine is not right. You say that phones have microchips in them, and then here you are being a burden to all by posting all this bullshit on your phone. Yes, phones have microchips in them. Shocking, right?

<p>You cannot state that and pretend to be intellectually honest. We just can't know yet. We will only get the response to this question in 20+ years. Saying that it's 100% safe is also very disingenuous considering the amount of side effects that were reported. Following your logic I could that covid is 100% non-deadly against young people, but that would be misleading wouldn't it ? See the flaw in your reasoning now ?</p>

        <p>No I did not. </p>
<p>I stated facts. </p>
<p>Go check VAERS,  this is easily obtainable information. You didn't prove anything, in fact, all of the studies as of late agree that the vaccinated are the variant factories and you saying it isn't true is just your opinion and unwillingness to accept the truth. The CDC even held a press conference about it and you'd think you would have known that. Even without the CDC, mathematics doesn't lie. All of the data coming from each country shows the exact same thing which supports the original statement. Numbers do not lie. </p>
<p>If you're such great mathematician and can prove otherwise then why don't you show us? We'd love to see it.  This is pretty basic stuff.</p>
