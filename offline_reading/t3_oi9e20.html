    <strong>Demonized for my own thoughts</strong>
    <p><p>Wow, I'm so glad I found this subbreddit a few days ago. For the last year, I've felt so alone since most of my now old friends were so pro covid restrictions. </p>
<p>My supposed best friend knew how I felt about the masks. She at first agreed with me, or so I thought. She told me how she felt guilty for enforcing restrictions that prevented people from mourning. (I would later experience the same thing). Then the first time we meet during the pandemic, she tried to guilt me in to wearing a mask. "You Have to wear this or else we won't be served". Then the photos started. "Hey. Look at how my mask matches my outfit, isn't it cute :D". </p>
<p>Apparently my response and actions made me the devil to them. I cab only imagine how they would react now. Especially with all the propaganda around the vaccine. I was labled as toxic because I was willing to argue against them. I was labeled a bad friend for voicing my thoughts.</p>
<p>My state is currently holding a lottery for those who get vaccinated. I've seen people get gift cards, free donuts, joints, you name it, my state will do it. </p>
<p>I've seen the signs around town. "VACCINATED? Thank you!!!!" Nearly on every street. </p>
<p>I've read the paper and seen columns about how my county will be at fault for low vaccination rates. The good old " You're destroying this country, you'll get everyone sick". </p>
<p>I'm so glad I found a place that actually allows for the questioning of propaganda. I'm sick of the pressure to get vaccines. I'm sick of people trying to make me be seen as the devil only because I question them. Keep fighting. </p>
<p>Now they'll be coming door to door.</p>
<p>Funny how those who are censored get proven right time after time.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed.</p>
<p>I saw one of my friends who I hadn‚Äôt seen in over a year, a few months back at some school ‚Äúcookout.‚Äù I was genuinely surprised she shared the same political views and hates masks and the ‚ÄòRona fear mongering just like the rest of my friends, as I had always thought she was a bit liberal.</p>
<p>It may just be unanticipated experiences‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt get my license till recently and needed a ride to another friend‚Äôa house, and one of my friends was able to pick me up. When I got into the car, I noticed he was wearing a mask‚Ä¶ and I made some joke- ‚Äúhey you don‚Äôt have to wear that, you aren‚Äôt Joe Biden.‚Äù That was literally all it took for him to change his mind and take it off.üòÇ Shit, I wish it was that easy for everyone‚Ä¶ so many brainwashed sheep out there who only listen to Fauci.</p>
<p>Of course, it does help living in a state with common sense, as you can actually find people with functioning brains here.</p>

        <p>My friends have been the same way, pretty passive aggressively. I'm okay sticking it out with them as long as it doesn't get worse, but it really is divisive. Remember that's what they want though, for us to feel isolated so that we cave in. Be compassionate and understanding with these people but stand your ground! I'm glad to have resources like this too; my thanks to you for being brave and to everyone else standing firm!</p>

        <p>You are not alone. I had enough of the bullshit and felt like the world was closing in on me. I‚Äôve heard bad things about Reddit but had no where to go. </p>
<p>My own friends and family started to zombify and turn on me. Anyway, welcome to the refugee camp.</p>

<p>It definitely seems to go that way, but in this case I really hope we're wrong. I hope everyone who has gotten the vaccine is okay.</p>
