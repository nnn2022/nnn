        <p>USA Take Action: Vax industry calls for blue-ribbon commission as confidence in covid 19 vax wanes
A group of vaccine industry insiders are calling for the appointment of a "blue-ribbon" commission to bolster sagging public confidence in potential covid 19 vaccines, and the federal agencies and companies that are supposed to produce them. Citing growing criticism of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) response to the covid 19 outbreak, and polls showing declining numbers of people who would get a covid 19 shot when and if it is available, vaccine industry insiders are looking for another way to move the vaccines forward.
"I'm hearing this from my peers, from doctors and nurses. They're not anti-vaxxers. They're pro-vaccine. They vaccinated their own children. But they are skeptical about this vaccine," said Dr. Kathryn Stephenson, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, and a proponent of a commission.
According to CNN polls, Americans when asked, "If a vaccine to prevent coronavirus infection were widely available at a low cost, would you, personally, try to get that vaccine, or not?" 33% answered "No" in May, but 40% said "No" in mid-August. "We're used to this world where if the FDA or the CDC or the National Academy of Sciences says something is safe and effective, that's enough, but I don't think this time that's sufficient to overturn public skepticism," said Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at NYU Langone Health and a vaccine industry spokesperson. "I think we desperately need an independent national commission." Blue-Ribbon Commissions are used for a wide variety of political purposes. The most important question usually is who will get to pick who is on the commission, because that will usually pre-determine the outcome. Blue-Ribbon Commissions are often used to make issues go away that decisionmakers don't want to deal with. They are sometimes a way for politicians to dodge responsibility for a tough decision. But the goal of this commission would be to get vaccines to market when the usual apparatus is faltering. The last thing we want to see is a commission packed with vaccine industry flunkies pushing covid 19 vaccines of dubious efficacy and safety onto the market. A commission like this would have to be approved by the President or Alex Azar, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. We need to stop that from happening.
