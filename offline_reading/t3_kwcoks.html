        <p>As wealthy as he is, and many of his kind in Hollywood, the shitlords still dictate their every thought, and ability to work again.  As a former striving actor, I can tell you, if you aren't on board with their every thought, you are cast aside.  In the name of "inclusion", ironically.</p>
<p>I am not glad I'm out of the industry.  I miss the work.  The money is like it is in every industry: concentrated at the top, which I never got anywhere near.  But, I AM GLAD that I don't have to be submissive to these people anymore.</p>

        <p>financial autonomy should translate to a lesser dependency on the system and a lesser obligation to the system. We're talking about a guy who has had a lengthy, high-profile career and came out with millions of dollars on many separate occasions. There's a reason people refer to this as "fuck you" money. You're telling me he made off with all this cash, but he <em>still</em> can't say "fuck you" ? Imagine if you woke up one day and your bank account was filled with the paycheck Bruce Willis takes home after one movie. You're telling me you couldn't say "fuck you" to your job?</p>

        <p>https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20the%20burden,from%20influenza%20(Table%201).</p>
<p>According to the CDC 35.5 million people got sick with influenza in the US 2019. There have been 22.9M COVID cases in the US. Influenza has a much lower mortality rate, granted, but the flu affects people of all ages and demographics, whereas severe COVID cases are concentrated in elderly populations and people with preexisting conditions such as lung disease, heart disease, and obesity. </p>

<p>The argument is not whether or not covid is deadly, or more or less deadly than anything else. Covid is contagious and has killed people. The argument is whether or not it justifies a massive change in social structure, economic distress, and the sacrifice of our freedoms (telling us where we can and cant go, what we can and cant do, and who we can and cant see). The people on this subreddit simply make the argument that a disease which has a most severe affect on the elderly (85+) who are retired and have the luxury to stay home should not effect the day to day lives of the rest who do not have that luxury, and certainly does not justify the 10+ million jobs lost in the united states alone.</p>
<p>Covid kills, but not enough to justify whats being done</p>

        <p>Well, we can agree to disagree on what should be done, or whether or not it is justified, those are subjective. </p>
<p>But I have to correct you here: even the seasonal flu produces more complications in elderly and immunocompromised. That's why the flu shot is mandated for hospital workers and promoted heavily among elderly populations. </p>
<p>Also, I have no clue what you mean by changes in social structure. But if we "sacrificed freedoms" the way other countries did, we wouldn't be facing "economic distress". Look around the world, countries who paid people to stay home, had mask mandates, and aggressively contact traced are living normal lives and some even have grown economically (NZ).</p>

        <p>Not a correction, a misunderstanding. Elderly and immunocompromised are generally affected more heavily by almost any disease, yes. The difference is the severe reactions to covid by people middle aged and younger are very rare and highly circumstantial.
As a younger person in fairly good health i can tell you covid gave me joint pains for a few days and took my sense of smell for a week or so. Still as a younger person in fairly good health ive had severe reactions to influenza, unable to keep anything down, fighting a fever, too weak to get out of bed or off the couch.</p>
<p>Changes in social structure as in people being downright hateful to someone for not wearing a mask, people living in fear, people unable to see friends and family, or fearing in some places if they do see friends or family, which is entirely their choice, that they will face legal ramifications.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, I have no clue what you mean by changes in social structure</p>
<p>If you mean to say that the way you interact with people, strangers or friends and family, hasn't changed in the last year then you are either a liar, or i feel deeply sorry for your pre-covid self.</p>
<p>If we "sacrificed freedoms the way other countries did we wouldnt be the USA. If you think there isnt a political agenda behind the mandates and lockdowns you are mistaken, and if you think the politicians in the Capitol, collecting their 6 figure salaries while they argue about whether to give someone $600 or $2000 to make up for the year of unemployment, really care about what happens to american citizens you are deceived. I know in your eyes im just a crazed conspiracy theorist, but i urge you to give it some honest, unbiased, critical thought, and research it for yourself, not just going off of what youre told by politicians and mainstream media.</p>

        <p>I think people like you WANT this to be deadlier than it is. Look at the statistics.</p>
<p>Anyone with a functioning brain would stay home if they were sick. Masks are virtue signalling and asymptomatic is horseshit.</p>

        <p>Edit: 50% of spread is via asymptomatic people</p>
<p>The seasonal flu has a death rate of around .1%. COVID-19 is around 1%. I can do math, that's 10x more?? </p>
<p>Multiply that by 300M americans and you get hospital ICUs at 100% capacity?? </p>
<p>Another way to think about it, the seasonal flu killed 22,000 people last year, but covid killed 22,000 people last week.</p>

<p>"In summary, the detection rate of asymptomatic positive cases in the post-lockdown Wuhan was very low (0.303/10,000), and there was no evidence that the identified asymptomatic positive cases were infectious."</p>
<p>Also the tests are proven unreliable with up to 97% false positives but these things are not getting any media or government attention.</p>
<p>Do you have sources for your death rate of 1%?</p>
<p>I don't know how they can have accurate numbers on anything to be honest with the false positive cases, the death inflation by assigning covid death to anyone that tested positive within a month. The flu has basically disappeared for 2020 too, how strange.</p>
<p>If this was as deadly as they're making it out to be, people would not have to be forced into staying home or being vaccinated. </p>
<p>Nothing is much different than usual if you don't listen to the tv and radio.</p>
