        <p>I agree with 1-4 and also that 4 is also constant across the rest but the last two I don’t see happening. There will be calls for it but, so far at least, the nation isn’t that stupid.</p>

        <p>Why do people see mask-wearing as a "muzzle?" It doesn't make any sense to me. <br>
And they'll lift social-distancing requirements once enough people are immunized, whether though getting the virus or through vaccinations. <br>
What do people even have against vaccines? Life before vaccines sucked.</p>

        <p>Typical disingenuous claptrap from another brainless sheep.</p>
<p>Those of us who are against <em>this</em> vaccine are almost never against <em>all</em> vaccines. Lumping it together is transparently a tactic to keep us on the defensive for a completely reasonable position. </p>
<p>Being <em>all in for a rushed vaccine of this nature</em> is the unreasonable position. </p>
<p>Even that is understating the case: It’s wildly foolish. This sort of blind trust in government has led to so much atrocity in both the recent and distant past, that to think <em>this time is different!</em> makes you nothing more than another interchangeable brain-dead cog in an evil, murderous machine.</p>
<p>Stating that “they“ will lift the restrictions is A. Predicting the future, which you obviously do not know, and B. Naïve in the extreme. Every goalpost they have set has been a lie. They have used every excuse in the book to keep restrictions in place, and indeed, accelerate them whenever possible.</p>
<p>Do you really wonder why people see mask wearing as a muzzle? Are you stupid? You’re literally wearing a muzzle over your mouth. It isn’t even figurative. Literally, a muzzle. Over your mouth.</p>
<p>The universal masking of the healthy is evil. The feverish push to create a dystopian, faceless society is beyond belief. Those of you who are desperate to see this dystopia become reality are depraved psychopaths. Or just morons who feel good when you display obedience to irrationality.</p>

        <p>Today at the cash register a girl I've known for years was behind me, she yelled my name and i blankly just stared at her bc i had no idea who the hell it was till she pulled her mask down. I always just thought masks were a symbol for no freedom of speech. Now i realize anyone with a mask on has no identity. Mask wearers literally just handed their identity over to the government with no questions asked. Sickening.</p>

        <p>&rt; Those of us who are against this vaccine are almost never against all vaccines.</p>
<p>I didn't know this.
&rt; Being all in for a rushed vaccine of this nature is the unreasonable position.</p>
<p>Of course we should be reasonably careful. But it's still a good idea to take it once there's enough trusted evidence of its safety.
&rt; This sort of blind trust in government has led to so much atrocity in both the recent and distant past, that to think this time is different! makes you nothing more than another interchangeable brain-dead cog in an evil, murderous machine.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you're talking about.
&rt; Stating that “they“ will lift the restrictions is A. Predicting the future, which you obviously do not know, and B. Naïve in the extreme.</p>
<p>It's an educated guess. I think it is highly likely they will lift mandates once there's no need for them.
&rt; Every goalpost they have set has been a lie.</p>
<p>What do you mean? 
&rt; They have used every excuse in the book to keep restrictions in place, and indeed, accelerate them whenever possible.</p>
<p>The virus is worse than it's ever been in the USA and will escalate worse than ever if they don't take action now.
&rt; Do you really wonder why people see mask wearing as a muzzle? Are you stupid? You’re literally wearing a muzzle over your mouth. It isn’t even figurative. Literally, a muzzle. Over your mouth.</p>
<p>No need to be uncivil and call me stupid. Of course I know both masks and muzzles cover your mouth. I'm wondering if those who say "muzzle" see masks as a way to restrict free speech or something.
&rt; The universal masking of the healthy is evil.</p>
<p>It's a temporary precaution, similar to seatbelts. Using seatbelts on the healthy makes sense, doesn't it?
&rt; The feverish push to create a dystopian, faceless society is beyond belief. Those of you who are desperate to see this dystopia become reality are depraved psychopaths. Or just morons who feel good when you display obedience to irrationality.</p>
<p>Who's wanting a dystopian, faceless society? Nobody wants that. Do you think all the liberals want that? Why is that logical to you?
&rt; Unfortunately, there are a lot of you.
Luckily, there are a lot of me too. And we are prepared to fight you. Hard. Till the end.</p>
<p>We all want life to return to "normal." We are all on the same side. The issue here is we believe that the best way for life to return to "normal" is for everyone to kill off the virus via not spreading it (mandates) and vaccinations.</p>

        <p>Personally I have nothing against vaccines. Mandating this with so little development time for a virus which my immune system will have no issue in dealing with just seems off.</p>
<p>As for masks, it's not fair to just tell us we have to without properly researching it.</p>

        <p>There is so little evidence and studies conducted on the effectiveness of masks against viral transmission, and the health workers were saying it <em>might</em> help a little, but never solidly said the effect was more than negligible. Then they mandated them without solid evidence of a worthwhile effect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a study was taken I think in Denmark on the effectiveness of masks and never published, which suggests to me the data proved masks were ineffective but ofc we can't be sure.</p>
<p>Overall, I just feel a mask mandate is not backed up enough. A recommendation, sure, but a mandate just isn't fair.</p>

        <p>&rt; There is so little evidence and studies conducted on the effectiveness of masks against viral transmission</p>
<p>I've seen plenty of evidence that shows the effectiveness of masks, especially when you look at asian countries that wear masks like Taiwan or S. Korea. I'd be <em>very</em> surprised if there were not <em>several</em> sources available right now if you were to look for dependable scholarly articles.</p>
<p>&rt; Furthermore, a study was taken I think in Denmark on the effectiveness of masks and never published, which suggests to me the data proved masks were ineffective but ofc we can't be sure.</p>
<p>There's studies that aren't published for all sorts of reasons all the time. There could have been a serious flaw in the study, there could have been a lack of funding for getting it published, it could have been only <em>temporarily</em> unpublished because edits to the writing needed to be corrected, there's <em>tons</em> of reasons it could have been not published.</p>

        <p>Nothing wrong with vaccines that have been tested and proven safe.</p>
<p>This thing has been made with a radical new technique, it's the first of its kind. And it has been tested for only a few months. Impossible to say what the long term effects could be.</p>
<p>And given how easily governments all over the world have been lying, censoring, and brushing all other negative health effects of the lockdown aside... Why would I trust them with this?</p>

<p>I suppose I can respect that point of view. Perhaps they are too overwhelmed with mainly rescuing everyone from the virus to spend much time helping people also face the negative side effects of mandates?</p>
<p>&rt; The usual antivaxxers are a small minority. It's over 30% in some countries when it comes to this one. Where do you think that extra 25% comes from?</p>
<p>I'm assuming you're saying that the "usual antivaxxers" are 5% of the community? If so, yeah, being skeptical about a new, rushed vaccine makes sense. It's still important to take one that works and is safe eventually of course.

<p>The head of the dutch icu council was asked why we have such a low icu capacity (6 beds per 100.000 people iirc, almost the lowest in europe), and why not bring icu capacity up to the levels of 10 years ago in the face of a pandemic (there have been huge cutbacks on healthcare the last 10 years). He said having too much personell would risk them getting bored at work, and that's the worst thing that could happen.</p>
<p>Also, parliament voted against bringing healthcare back to the old capacity. From that point on, it's on purpose if you ask me.</p>
<p>But still, what if those negative effects are worse than the impact of the disease itself? In march, april, may, I can see why they would be too busy for that. But 7 months have passed now, and this side of the argument is still being ignored and even actively silences. 
A big group of doctors, scientists and healthcare workers wrote a letter to all members of the parliament with that argument. They asked for an open debate about how to treat this new disease and how to face the pandemic. They were ignored and that was the end of it. </p>
<p>&rt;I'm assuming you're saying that the "usual antivaxxers" are 5% of the community?</p>
<p>5% at the most, yes. And that's being generous. Some weird hippy moms and some biblethumpers. A very small minority. </p>
<p>&rt;If so, yeah, being skeptical about a new, rushed vaccine makes sense. It's still important to take one that works and is safe eventually of course. What would you life to see in order to trust it?</p>
<p>Long term testing. But given the lying and censorship I've seen the last few months, I'm not sure I would trust even that.</p>

<p>I definitely think making sure that it's not is a very good things to do. I personally doubt that it would be worse, especially considering that if we had zero mandates at all it would surely have spread more. But yeah, they should at least address those doctor's concerns or come up with a plan for covering the different side-effects of mandates.</p>

        <p>With all due respect, I think the sheep analogy is a bit ironic:
I personally doubt everything I hear until I can confirm it (and so don't consider myself a sheep) but I think most of the people that call people sheep are all following each other's opinions without solid proof (like sheep).</p>

        <p>Lockdowns are VERY authoritarian if you ask me, especially over a virus with a 99% survival rate. But you are kinda right about vaccines, most of them are harmless but the COVID one was put together in 5-6 months and wasn't thoroughly tested so I'm kinda skeptical about it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, having a healthy amount of skepticism is intelligent. I'm waiting until I see the vaccine isn't harmful through their human trials. It sounds like the side effects are just small fever/nausea for the first day (probably just the body's response to the weakened virus in the vaccine) and then you're fine.
&rt; especially over a virus with a 99% survival rate
Just want to point out that it's not all about dying: There's permanent harmful effects this virus could leave behind for some. It's also about spread: The reason why Ebola (which has a high death rate) wasn't as big a deal was because it can't spread super easily. This is a super duper contagious disease, meaning more people will get it and pass away or get lifetime bad effects from it. We're going to have so many more deaths from covid than the flu. I don't really get why they're ever compared.</p>

        <p>First of all let me just say I appreciate the fact that you are willing to have discussion about this fact rather than just calling people morons like the other guy. Now I can’t speak for anyone here either in fact I don’t agree with a lot of the sentiment here, I’ve always taken vaccines and despite my distaste for it I still wear my mask out where it’s mandated, however I can understand where a lot of people are coming from here and in my opinion to say that mandatory vaccinations are an impossibility is wrong and it’s an understandable fear. With this year being as crazy as it is and talks of the vaccine being rushed out even I’m afraid to put it in my body, so I can’t judge anyone for having the same fears and reservations about it after all the government isn’t always honest. Now do I think we are going to approach mandatory vaccines and stuff like that no probably not but I also can’t pretend it’s impossible. Nobody knows how everything is going to pan out there is so much misinformation out there that’s it’s difficult for anyone to know what way is up but as for me personally, I’ve always had a live and let live mentality in all aspects of my life I never truly know how what situation the guy next to me is in maybe he’s deathly afraid of having his mouth covered maybe he has a fear of putting things in his body or maybe he just doesn’t trust the government I’ve got no clue because I can’t speak for anyone here, but I think a big part of the fear or vaccines and masks is the fact they are slowly becoming more mandatory as time goes on and people who may very well have their own and very legitimate reasons for not wanting to mask up or vaccine up are basically being told they might not be even given a choice and that’s a scary thought and for some people it may be a scarier thought than any virus ever could be. At the end of the day I can’t speak for anyone here, but as for why I am here it’s because I don’t believe I have the wisdom or the authority to tell anyone else how to live their lives and I don’t think anyone else should have that absolute of an authority either.</p>

That's totally understandable. I only want the vaccine after it's been verified as safe through enough human trials.<br>
\&rt; people who may very well have their own and very legitimate reasons for not wanting to mask up or vaccine up are basically being told they might not be even given a choice and that’s a scary thought<br>
Just want to point out that there <em>are</em> some people who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons and these particular groups of people will <em>surely</em> not be forced to receive vaccines.</p>

        <p>I’m glad I was able to be understood then :D</p>
<p>Honestly for me personally I just want people to be more reasonable with each other and be able to talk things out none of us are ever all going to agree with eachother 100% of the time that’s the way of the world, I’m personally pro vaccine but there are people in the world who are anti vaccine and that’s ok I don’t hate them we just disagree and I just wish people could disagree instead of hate.</p>
<p>As for the people who can’t be vaccinated due to their medical reasons there is obviously them but I just also want people to recognize that sometimes it’s not always medical reasons for example I personally suffer from a medical condition myself and for a VERY long time I didn’t take any medication for it because I had tried before and it had hurt me I was afraid of the medicine even though it was supposed to help me because it had once hurt me and it took a good bit of therapy to move past that and that’s why I understand why some people don’t want vaccines and why I can’t support them being forced onto people no matter the severity because you never know when there’s going to be that one guy or girl that’s just as afraid as I once was.</p>

        <p>&rt; Honestly for me personally I just want people to be more reasonable with each other and be able to talk things out none of us are ever all going to agree with eachother 100% of the time that’s the way of the world, I’m personally pro vaccine but there are people in the world who are anti vaccine and that’s ok I don’t hate them we just disagree and I just wish people could disagree instead of hate.</p>
<p>Oh, I totally agree here in that I wish people could discuss rather than just hate.</p>
<p>I think what's a bit difficult about the vaccine situation is that those who cannot be vaccinated can only receive protection from the immunity of those around them.</p>

        <p>It’s definitely a gray area rather than black and white, honestly I don’t think anyone is truly right because I don’t think there really is a right answer we all want to live our lives and keep ourselves and our loved ones safe. I just don’t want anyone to jump off the deep end and start forcing them on people nor do I want people to not take them at all so it’s definitely tricky 😅</p>
