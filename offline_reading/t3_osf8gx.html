    <strong>Of all those that get Covid, what % require hospitalisation?</strong>
    <p><p>There’s a problem with talking about the “survival rate” even though it’s very high:</p>
<p>The current survival rate is based off the data of those that get it and recover.</p>
<p>those that get it are anywhere from:</p>
<p>“wow I had covid and I didn’t even realise” to “I was intubated and was an in-patient for a long time” compared with those that got it and died.</p>
<p>Both people had covid. Both people recovered. One person put pressure on the hospital system, one didn’t.</p>
<p>When talking about survival rate we are INCLUDING those that have medical intervention.</p>
<p>The a more accurate survival rate is ONLY talking about those that get it and <em>do not require</em> hospitalisation and recover at home. This is what TRULY paints the “how deadly
Is covid” picture.</p>
<p>This likely means that those that DID require hospitalisation, would likely have died if they didn’t get care/treatment and therefore the survival rate would be lower.</p>
<p>Hence the question: of those that get covid, how many require hospitalisation?
I’m sure many of you already have this data, I’m keen to read on this.</p>
<p>The reason why this is critical is because in my arguments with hysterical pro experimental gene therapy morons is that the ultimate argument to get vax is to </p>
<p>1) reduce symptoms so that</p>
<p>2) you are less likely to infect people and therefore</p>
<p>3) less infections mean less hospitalisation (which <em>presumes</em> that everyone that gets covid needs hospital attention) and therefore</p>
<p>4) less pressure on hospitals and therefore</p>
<p>5) people needing normal care are not triaged away because cross infection risk and then deteriorate further because of the covid blockage to the system </p>
<p>Once we know what the % chance of NOT needing hospitalisation, you can more accurately argue the point of risk-benefit ratio of covid vs experimental gene therapy </p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>youll never gwt an accurate answer on this because there will never be an accurate count on how many peoole actually got covid.  its likely at least 2 to 3x higher than the reported cases.  many were asymptomatic.  many were just felt kjnda shitty and didnt bother testing.  others just self disgnosed and stayed home.  the real number of cases vs hospitalizations/deaths will never be reported, because those numbers would make this thing look like the flu.</p>

        <p>Yea that’s the real problem and I realise that.
Two friends in Texas were asymptomatic. They were at risk due to medical condition and age yet recovered at home.</p>
<p>At the same time there is the whole problem with the classification system for covid that hospitals around the world use, as defined by the WHO. The UO7.02 and 7.01 classifications.</p>
<p>Essentially this means that one person could die and have positive c19 on record whereas the other could die with a negative c19 on record but the doctor could still sign off as c19 death based on their professional discretion (or based on hospital protocol/ policy since I know in the USA, hospitals get funded more when it’s a c19 death).</p>
<p>1) the official deaths are dubious and will be far less than stated</p>
<p>2) the unknown infected and recovered count has been well documented: I remember in NY state they did 3000 randomised antibodies test and found out that the amount of people that had already had covid without knowing was FAR higher than expected.</p>
<p>Likewise in the UK, over 100,000 people were tested and they realised that the gift estimation of infected cases unreported was about 20x higher than estimated (I think it was over 20x but I cannot remember the exact number, I think it was 23x).</p>
<p>So less deaths than normal, far more infected and recovered without hospitalisation than normal... all of that will define the true mortality rate.</p>

        <p>Based on the absolute risk reduction seen in the preliminary vaccine data, the base chance of severe disease/hospitalization is about 2% of cases, lumping all ages together.</p>
<p>I'm getting this from the relative risk reduction of about 95% and the absolute risk reduction being between 0.7-1.2% depending on vaccine.</p>

        <p>It just blows my mind that <em>this</em> is the reality of the situation, THIS is the real data and following “the science” but the mentality and agenda perpetuated in media leads people to think the mortality rate is greater than 10%.</p>
<p>Like all this talk about the delta variant being noted deadly. All the data says NO</p>

        <p>The media keeps saying that Delta is more transmissible or infectious.  People interpret that as more deadly, especially based on the tone of the articles.</p>
<p>I think I read one story where they surveyed people and they thought the mortality rate of Covid was around 38%.  People respond to emotion, especially fear, instead of reason and facts.</p>

        <p>Back when the UK or Brazilian strain was discovered, the news stated “new strain could be more infectious and deadly”
Then the cut to a clip interview of the specialist that identified the strain and he literally said “WE DONT KNOW YET IF IT IS MORE DEADLY OR MORE INFECTIOUS YET”</p>
<p>But because the media already implied risk, people walk away with the next paraphrase “it’s more deadly and infectious”</p>

        <p>To summarize, it’s all bullshit. The whole thing is a game. No reason for us to discuss numbers when the sheeple won’t believe us. Warning you and fellow posters not to fall victim to the echo chamber of a subreddit, as facts don’t work against the vax-brigade. I am with you. I want you to survive this war on humanity.</p>
