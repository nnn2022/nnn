        <p>I read that article this morning and wanted to throw it in the face of doomers who were complaining recently on a sports forum. They'd shown a pic of a Korean baseball game with spectators and said, "This is what we'd have now if we'd handled this better." </p>

        <p>This is my biggest issue here. The pro-mask people don't actually understand the anti-mask position. No, the virus is not a hoax and yes, masks are somewhat useful for reducing the spread. The thing is we NEED it to spread so that we can have herd immunity and it needs to be before flu season. For me, the mask is a symbol of a fundamental misunderstanding of the larger situation.</p>

        <p>Yes, exactly!  I'd suggest that they also don't understand their own position.  As I said the other day:</p>
<p>What is the current goal of these mask mandates and other restrictions? To eradicate the virus? To stop the spread? Clearly that's not working and not going to work.  To slow the spread? Ok... but <em>why</em>? The initial (supposed) rationale was to buy hospitals time to prepare for a surge and prevent them from being overwhelmed by delaying the peak and reducing its size. That at least had some logic to it. But now, <em>four months</em> later, what is the goal of slowing the spread? To save lives by buying time for the development and widespread distribution of a vaccine? Give me a break. It's <em>painfully</em> obvious that we can't slow the spread that much, and that even if we could that the benefits wouldn't be worth the massive cost. By the time an effective vaccine is available for widespread distribution, it will be almost wholly irrelevant. Slowing the spread at this point is not merely useless, it's counterproductive. It's only extending this nightmare and increasing the length of time that the truly vulnerable and irrationally fearful need to remain paranoid and locked down.  If anything, we'd be better served by efforts to <em>un-flatten</em> the curve led by the young and healthy to expedite the arrival of herd immunity. <strong>#SharpenTheCurve</strong></p>

        <p>Thanks! I really do think these are the most fundamental question people should be asking. What are the goals of the current measures? Why are those the goals? Do those goals make sense? What evidence do we have that these goals are achievable with these measures? What’s crazy to me is that “flatten the curve” was THE rallying cry back in March and now it’s like everyone has forgotten the entire concept of an epidemic curve even exists. But you look at Sweden, Italy, Spain, and really pretty much any country and you can see a curve. And you can see that this virus burns itself out once it runs out of susceptible people to infect. You can see the same thing in the US although it’s sufficiently large and geographically diverse that its different regions are experiencing their own curves. This thing is pretty much done in the northeast whereas it’s just now getting to its peak in the southeast and west. It doesn’t seem terribly difficult to wrap one’s mind around this stuff.</p>

        <p>Yes! My exact thoughts!! I even posed a question to my FB "friends"- "What is the magical number you are looking for, to begin living again, without masks and fear- AND let's add, continued shut-downs to the list???"  No one could give a clear answer, of course! Why? Because they are going with the flow. Believing that Fauci, WHO and CDC, etc... have all the direction they need. HA...The term "sheep" is very overused but so very applicable! We have the information world at our fingertips, yet ppl are taking what we're told by Fauci, Birx, etc...as gospel. My frustration mostly lies, in the fact that, no matter what proof, studies, info, etc... we have to the contrary, doesn't change the fact that we "have to" abide by current executive orders and shut-downs!! I have not worn a mask since this all began. But if I need to go see my physician for an issue not even remotely related to CoVid-19, I will HAVE to wear one, or not get the care I may need! If ppl think this is going to magically disappear and that is what they (and Gov't)  are waiting for???? Well we'd better get ready to see more of the same and then some. The control over us, is getting out of hand. And I fear it's the beginning of something bigger!</p>

        <p>Yes, we're not anti-mask because we don't care about other people/the community/the country. We're anti-mask because we DO.</p>
<p>We know the facts about COViD and know that in the long run, letting the population get exposed to it is healthier than isolating them. In fact, getting the government out of the way completely and allowing individuals to decide where they'll go and what they'll do is the best strategy. I don't disagree with shutting down events with thousands of spectators like sports and concerts, but the rest of the choices should have been left to the people.</p>
<p>I explained to someone that humans have never treated a pathogen this way before (isolating and quarantining untested and asymptomatic people) and that it's a tactic doomed to fail. That person responded that we as a society know so much more about disease transmission now, so we need to take action to save lives. </p>
<p>But if the actions we're taking are actually prolonging the outbreak, how many lives are we truly saving?</p>

<p>Particularly if these lives saved are coming at a staggering socio-economic cost.</p>
<p>My objection to masks has generally been focused around three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>That wearing one for show makes me complicit in something I know not to be true (not the reality of the virus, but rather the wisdom of the broader public health strategy since March).  It plays into a hysteria that I will not be a part of or endorse.  I want people to see I'm not scared to perhaps give them a bit more courage, as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That to accept the government's masks edicts and recommendations is to give them a level of respect and credibility that they have not earned.  I refuse to acknowledge "expertise" until the experts are held to account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That, from a purely functional standpoint, masks are fundamentally not as effective as claimed, even if the appropriate goal were to "crush the curve" rather than "flatten" it (it isn't).  Asymptomatic transmission is a small factor and typical masks are a weak measure.</p>
</li>

        <p>Pro mask crowd does not understand that we are anti-mask...mandates. Especially since everyone is hopping on the bandwagon to require them and not giving it any independent thought.</p>
<p>I can’t understand for the life of me why European countries find mandatory masks unnecessary for the public (especially the healthy with no symptoms), but Americans treat masks as the COVID Lord and Savior and want Biden to win so he gives us a national mask rule on Day 1. Science is really that different between America and Europe?</p>

        <p>Some European countries are also mask obsessed. I think Germany was the first to make them mandatory in shops and on public transport, and that was in April. It's nearly August and they're still shutting down suggestions to remove the mandate. Now they're trying to push them everywhere (they "won" the argument with airlines to make them mandatory everywhere, regardless of if the countries you're flying between use them or not). </p>
<p>Most other EU countries are only now forcing masks, but I do think that's a response to American propaganda influencing the general population rather than them actually believing they work. I've only seen these mask lovers on social media spout American talking points and refuse to shut up about New York.</p>

        <p>&rt; Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.</p>

<p>We say we're against mask mandates, and people think we are against anyone ever wearing a mask. It's as if people believe we do not want the sick to take medicine because we do not want the government to make drugs.</p>

        <p>Do you have a citation for proof of a novel corona virus? And no, masks have zero statistical efficacy against infectious contagions. None of this has anything to do with a mask or a virus for that matter. It’s also a conspiracy but not a theory</p>

        <p>Both of the hospitals my wife and I work at got close to ventilator capacity.</p>
<p>When you compare Sweden to the US, you are not considering three significant factors.  1 - their healthcare system is much better equipped in relation to population size and density.  2 - their city population density is much lower than US cities.  3 - their society is a reserved society.  They effectively practiced social distancing before COVID hit.</p>
<p>I've said it before - I agree that a national lockdown was the wrong response.  It should have been handled at local levels.  Look at Wyoming where population density is low and people keep to themselves. Low infection rate. Not much point to lockdown that state, except some local common sense restrictions in Cheyenne.</p>
<p>But to say "look at Sweden", it's not a fair comparison, and you end up ignoring important variables.</p>

        <p>It's funny you mention hospitals. I went to my yearly checkup last week and while waiting in the lobby I noticed it was EMPTY. This got me thinking, where are all these so called "covid" patients 🤔🤔</p>
<p>After I walked around and nothing, just people standing around like usual. I drove to two other hospitals anf yup, you guessed right, it was EMPTY. These hospitals receive funding for every positive patient they claim which is why there's so many positives. It's a scam. To prove my point I scheduled a test, checked in, but then left right away without ever taking the test. For some reason now my results show as pending. I won't be surprised if a positive result comes back, this is a known hoax people! WAKE UP</p>
