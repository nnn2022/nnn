    <strong>My bottom line opinion on masks.</strong>
    <p><p>I was having a conversation with my s/o yesterday, and I was able to articulate this better than I have previously.</p>
<p>I don’t think that people who <em>want</em> to wear masks are stupid. I think it is debatable whether or not the mandates violate the first and eighth amendments. There is so much information out there to prove and disprove both sides of the argument regarding the efficacy of masks, leaving people to come to their own conclusions. I believe this is done on purpose to create the divide.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the real problem, and bottom line, is this -</p>
<p>Masks set the precedent that you NO LONGER HAVE THE FREEDOM OF CHOICE.</p>
<p>Whether it is made into law, or forced by societal pressure, you no longer have a personal choice. Individual thought and critical thinking is no longer acceptable. Either fall in line, or be punished by law and/or shunned by your peers.</p>
<p>Masks are just the beginning. The ideology will not stop there. This precedent will be the stepping stone for perpetual control and restrictions on each individual life.</p>
<p>My qualm with the “mask police” people is whether they realize it or not (most do not, in my opinion), they are advocating for the abolishment of freedom of choice.</p>
<p>I think I can speak for the majority here - that is a world that I have zero interest in.</p></p>

<p>There really isn't any information showing masks are effective.  Some "studies" point to models or other theoretical situations but there is absolutely zero observational evidence that masks work.</p>

        <p>what sucks is newspapers do not platform anyone who “questions the science” which is ironic because heretics like us will link to a bunch of studies, and when you get down to it, the pro masking evidence is the two hairdressers in Missouri and that study with the mannequins blowing aerosols through a mask.  Am i missing any solid pro mask evidence?  i would be a little softer on the policy if it showed any effectiveness, but also if the “virus” was even a quarter as bad as they said it would be.  I’m sorry but 1 in a thousand dead, when one in a hundred die per year is not worth shutting down the world for many, many, many reasons downstream of these choices to lockdown and mask up for 1 in 1000 avg age of 82.</p>

        <p>The hair dressing story is so ridiculous to me because it's what the cdc officially says on their website as to why masks work. Like...That's it  ? All you Got? Also, if you walk into any hospital, they will ask you to switch from your cloth mask to a surgical one. If cloth masks were effective, that wouldn't be necessary.</p>

        <p>The mask police are the same as the "Good Germans."  Regular citizens who, knowingly or not, are doing the dirty work of the NWO.</p>
<p>The grocery store manager who flexes his power by going around telling everyone to mask up is just doing his job ("I'm just following orders", the nazis used to say) but he secretly loves the power and no amount of common sense is going to make him give that up.</p>

        <p>Exactly.The fact that it's compulsory just makes me not want to do it. Maybe I'm oppositional defiant, I don't know. But the argument they always make is "It's not that much to ask, just do it, it MIGHT save lives" just doesn't cut it for me. Forcing me to do ANYTHIMG is too much to ask.</p>

        <p>I'm not overly concerned with wearing a mask, if people were polite about it "excuse me please would you mind wearing a mask or moving away as I have X,Y,Z concerns about my health" absolutely fine I'll do whatever in my power to help you feel safe.</p>
<p>When it's expected of me, and then people get arsey and demand masks calling me names that's when I get pissed off.</p>
<p>Example, if I was standing at a bus stop smoking a fag, and someone said excuse me please could you move away with that, sure no problem. If they start pretend coughing or saying get the fuck away from me with that shit I probably won't budge.</p>
<p>It's not down to stubbornness (maybe a bit) but I would never in a million years speak to someone that way. Politeness really does go a long way, regardless of your beliefs, there is a way to get what you want and calling me a covidiot or grandma killer removes my want to reciprocate politeness.</p>

        <p>Masks are just very effective at displaying obedience to law, not necessary effective against the actual disease they were intended for, social distancing follows similarly, but what about Hand washing? The very first and most important line of defence against Corona. Why isn't hand washing being idolised as much as masks and social distancing? In my opinion, its hard to know whether someone washed their hands other than them telling you truthfully they did. Which confuses me when people complain about others not wearing a mask. Why don't you hear people say "well if you're not wearing a mask can you just wash your hands please?". It's not about protecting against covid really, but to ensure people are complying with popular opinion, mass media, law etc...</p>
