    <strong>Got 2 complaints for not wearing a obedience mask over my noise at work yesterday</strong>
    <p><p>My boss told me about it but he didn’t really seem to care all he said was and I quote: </p>
<p>“We received 2 complaints about you not having a mask over your noise keep it up and I’ll have to send you home.”</p>
<p>What’s weird about this statement is normally if I get in trouble at work I’ll have to go to the office and they Shut the office door. He told me after I clocked in. I was not sent to the office and he just continued on doing what he was he doing. </p>
<p>My work definitely knows my views on masks. I make it known every single day how I’m done with the mask bull shit. It feels like they took that into consideration honestly. I thought about arguing about but then I thought maybe I should just have a wait and see approach so I just said “Okay” even though it did piss me off. </p>
<p>Because I don’t cut off my air supply willingly. Your lucky it was even over my mouth. What do you guys think? Does it seem like not a big deal? Just a “I have to tell you situation even though I don’t really care about it situation”.</p></p>

        <p>I think your work is misinformed. Proof exists that masks cause hypoxia.</p>
