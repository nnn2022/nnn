    <strong>I’m chronically ill, and COVID is a joke</strong>
    <p><p>For a bit of background I’m a pretty severe asthma patient, and thanks to my daily medications my immune system may as well not exists when it comes to anything infecting my lungs. I regularly get sent to the hospital for normal common cold infections.</p>
<p>I stopped giving a single f*** about my state’s mask and social distancing orders way back in June. I hung out with family, went to church, went to parks, and lived my life like nothing was going on. I only wound up catching the super scary COVID off my MIL two weeks before thanksgiving because she came over after catching it from a coworker. </p>
<p>I’m the poster child for needing an extended hospital stay for any normally minor respiratory illness, and the freaking super scary COVID-19 super death pandemic gave me how I would expect a normal person to experience the flu... 3 days of blowing my nose, mild fever, voice lost to throat inflammation, and taking mucinex and the thing was gone. It was literally the most mild respiratory illness I’ve had in over a decade.... which is really saying something when I’ve spent time in the hospital  in really bad shape as an adult with a virus that is so mild it’s normally only able to affect children 4 and younger...</p>
<p>All this fear-mongering, social distancing, mask wearing, contact tracing, and the continued draconian lockdowns are nonsense.</p></p>

        <p>I wonder if there's any correlation between severity of Covid-19 symptoms and how scared a person is of getting it.</p>

        <p>Not really. The common cold isn't a specific virus, it can be caused by a few different things. Rhinovirus is the most classic, but mild viral ailments caused by a variety of germs, including coronaviruses, are all classed as "common cold".</p>
<p>Except for the fact that Covid-19 wasn't, until recently, "common", it seems to fit into the same category pretty well.</p>

        <p>This is what happens when the MSM and politics gets involved in something that is on par with a seasonal cold/flu, coronaviruses cause the common cold and this is just another strain of it... yes, those that have severe outcomes are older and have severe co-morbidities but not to forget that the average age of death is in the 80's and the recovery rate is 99.7%</p>

        <p>No, the CDC's latest estimated IFR for people 70+ is 5.4%, which would equate to a 94.6% survival rate.  But this IFR is for the average person older than 70, so that exact IFR is probably only reached by a person considerably older than 70, possibly 78-80 or so.</p>
<p>The IFR for ages 50-69 is 0.5%, or a 99.5% survival rate.  Since age 60 is right in the middle of that age band, the survival rate for a 60-year-old is probably close to that same number, 99.5%.  A healthy 60-year-old would be higher than that.</p>

        <p>I got it too, it was one of the mildest colds I've ever had. Actually, the best part was using it to stay home for 3 days and watch movies</p>

        <p>You are lucky, Mr. Dirge. My father was a transplant patient and he got this at a negligent rehab center after having a coronary artery bypass and brought it home to Mom and I.</p>
<p>Both my parents died from it and my mother was HEALTHIER than I am and was at the time of her death. My symptoms were what I would call moderate but the real kicker one was that for literally 4 days I could not get out of the recliner and on the last day my nose started fountaining blood like a literal fountain.</p>
<p>Scared the pee out of me and my mother who saw it start happening (this was before she got worse and had to be taken to the hospital where she died).</p>
