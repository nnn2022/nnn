        <p>I laughed hysterically at this, tried to read it to my husband and was unable to because I was laughing and crying so hard. Thank you, laughing like that is so rare nowadays</p>

        <p>LoL now this is a serious question.  A man's proximate cause of death was due to a fall from a ladder.  But because of the way his lungs were found during the autopsy, they claimed it was COVID, despite the fact that the condition of his lungs could have been due to something else.    <br>
 Additionally, they didn't even test him nor was he ever diagnosed with COVID!  In most places, you need a doctor to certify to change cause of death, and places make $ declaring COVID illnesses and deaths, so you know you're probably better off getting someone to fake a death certificate lol.</p>
