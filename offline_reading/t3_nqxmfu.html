        <p>There is the J&amp;J case with the bloot clot, but that was a single instance.</p>
<p>There is obviously still an inherent risk with taking the vaccine, including it not being administered correctly. However, it's just basic risk analysis. The stats of people dying from the vaccine are basically non-existent compared to covid.</p>
<p>I do see the argument about lockdowns too. When you compared Florida and California, they had the same death rate, despite California being on full lockdown and Florida not being on lockdown.</p>
<p>That's the thing. People don't think like that. Yeah, if a place has a low enough death rate and they can do some risk analysis to determine that it's <em>better</em> to be open than closed, then sure. But that's not the case in many places.</p>

        <p>The difference is that the 3.7m million deaths have been over a year and a half, with the largest amount being 80+. We're still in the first stages of the mass experimental vaccine that will have implications not only now, but in years to come, to people of all ages.</p>
<p>I wonder what you'll think once they start attributing covid deaths back to being caused by the flu (which have been noted as practicably none during the pandemic). Will you notice?</p>

        <p>Well you didn’t actually provide an example, as there is no mention of covid itself playing any role in her death, only that there is a currently an investigation of the astrazeneca vaccine in her death, as she may have gotten a blood clot from it. Which in itself is extremely rare, only 332 reported cases and 58 desths amongst the 35 million astrazeneca vaccines distributed in the UK.</p>

<p>I don’t see how that is at relevant to you just picking some random ass article to defend your point when it didn’t provide anything of the sort</p>
<p>And i don’t see how it is relevant to how 3 million people who got sick died within two weeks of getting the virus. Obviously some of those deaths are people who otherwise would’ve survived, but denying those three million people, 2.14 percent of the people who got the virus just happened to die within two weeks of getting it, is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Surgeons started wearing modern surgical masks in the 1960s (according to google), now either this whole mask conspiracy has been planned for almost 60 years or they work to at least some extent.

        <p>And are they even 1% effective? I have yet to see convincing evidence of this. I understand the claim in theory, but in practice I would love to see this 1% in the data.</p>
<p>And you're right, there is no way even the most generous proclaimed effectiveness comes close to offsetting the cultural damage they have done. Watching people desperately clinging to masks is truly mind blowing and sad.</p>

        <p>Pick your source. Worldometers, ourworldindata, Johnshopkins, Google, etc. Then pick a place (California, Texas, New York, Utah, etc). Compare their numbers with when masks were mandated. Go check out compliance numbers. This guy does a good job at compiling the data and laying it out visually. https://twitter.com/ianmSC?s=09. Go through the charts. You're going to have to do more than just taking what Anthony Fauci tweets or what CNN reports as gospel. </p>
<p>Models have their place. But the models being used for covid have been objectively wrong from the beginning. It's because they were built on bad assumptions and weak data.</p>

        <p>Just because masks were mandated doesn't mean people actually followed through with it. But I know from my experience and from statistics in my country and state that masks have been working along side other preventative measures.</p>
<p>Also the only times I've heard Fauci mentioned were from subreddits like this. I don't listen to him or anything, he's not my health expert. </p>
<p>Utah mandated masks on Nov 9th, during a rise of cases. Of course the cases didn't start dropping down immediately because people wouldve been still infectious after the mandate began. The cases have dropped significantly since the vaccine rollout near the start of December (however rollout was slow so it took time before it took effect)</p>
<p>New York implemented masks in April, as well as a lockdown. They did great until they got the second wave, but vaccines have helped reduce it</p>
<p>The reason we wear masks is to protect others from our bacteria and whatnot. We are supposed to wear masks and social/physical distance and maintain good hygiene (which we all should be doing before covid). </p>
<p>Masks are not the one thing to stop covid. It requires a multitude of things but masks are one of the easiest things to do because it's just putting something on your face for a few minutes while you shop that offers protection to others and yourself. It can be harder to regulate social distancing in a busy grocery store, but wearing a mask is simple and effective when combined with other measures.</p>

        <p>Mask compliance has been extremely high through out the world. Never in human history have more masks ever been worn by more people at the same time.</p>
<p>What state and country are you in? There is not one state in the US where mask usage led to better covid numbers. So I am curious what place you are talking about.</p>
<p>I live in Utah. Masks were mandated in in Salt Lake County at the end of June. They were mandated in Utah County in September. Masks were required in every store and school in the state in june. Then a statewide mask mandate was implemented at the beginning of November. Yet with unprecedented levels of mask wearing, cases continued to skyrocket, not peaking until after Christmas. Masks did not stop the initial peak in July. And then with objectively more people wearing masks in the fall, cases, hospitalizations, and deaths rose to record levels regardless of the mask mandates. There was no impact on the trajectory of cases. There was no measurable impact on the spread of covid. And utah's curve matched every surrounding state almost identically even though each state had very different covid restrictions. Masks DID NOT WORK in Utah. I live here. I know. I have looked at the data almost every day for the last year.</p>
<p>New York implemented its mask mandate after its cases had already peaked and started to decline. Masks had no impact on the spread of covid in New York. And then with even higher mask usage, New York's second wave exploded beyond its first wave.</p>
<p>Masks do not have any measurable impact on protecting others. This is because covid is primarily spread via aerosols and masks cannot stop aerosols.</p>
<p>Your faith in masks is not supported by the data. I get that you are a true believer, but masks do not do what you think they do. Masks are a religious talisman that empirically do not slow the spread of covid.</p>

        <p>Im not a "true believer". I honestly hate wearing masks and im thankful that I didn't have to wear them for months until we had another outbreak. Im in vic, Australia and we've had the worst amount of covid but masks have helped reduce the spread slightly</p>
<p>&rt;"Both surgical masks and unvented KN95 respirators, even without fit-testing, reduce the outward particle emission rates by 90% and 74% on average during speaking and coughing, respectively, compared to wearing no mask, corroborating their effectiveness at reducing outward emission."  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7">here</a></p>
<p>The best types of masks to wear are n95 and I do agree and understand that masks can not 100% stop the spread, but it helps limit the spread.</p>
<p>&rt;“The results could indicate a more moderate degree of protection of 15-20%, however, the study could not rule out that face masks do not provide any protection.”  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-facemasks-idUSKBN27Y1YW">here</a></p>
<p>All of the data and articles I've read all say that masks do help to limit the spread and provide some protection, but the best masks are N95 as they are the most efficient.</p>
<p>Can you send me some actual sources? I've provided you 5 articles that show how and what masks are effective.</p>

        <p>How are you coming to the conclusion that masks have helped reduce the spread slightly? How are you quantifying "slightly"? Is there some sort of data set that shows this slight reduction?</p>
<p>Australia has had one of the most strict lockdowns in the entire world. You guys are still continuously locking down a year and a half into this mess, while where I live there are basically zero restrictions at all. Your borders have been completely closed to international travel for over a year and military enforced quarantines are required for any of the few people allowed to enter your country. I've watched the videos of the police enforcing lockdowns in Australia, and it's disgusting. To attribute this claimed slight reduction in covid spread to mask wearing is like beating cancer using aggressive chemotherapy, but attributing your success to you taking a daily multivitamin.</p>
<p>Sure, there are a few limited situations where masks can be helpful. But those situations require a controlled, sterile environment like a hospital; trained professionals who know how to use their masks correctly (good hygiene, frequent disposal, limited touching and adjusting) and who have had them properly fitted; and high quality masks specially designed for the task at hand. So n95 masks, used by trained doctors, in the hospital, could have some positive benefits, but that is not really what we are talking about. Doctors wearing masks has been a common practice for years. We are talking about forcing every man, woman, and child to wear any kind of mask they can get their hands on, any time they interact in the public, often times for hours on end, indefinitely. How you cannot see the ridiculousness of such a thing is strange. And especially since after over a year of unprecedented mask wearing in almost every nation on earth, there has no measurable impact on the spread of covid. There is no correlation between mask wearing and better covid numbers. For every example of a place where you might be able to argue that masks were helpful, there are 20 places where masks objectively failed. This desire to cling to masks and insist that they must work, despite all the data clearly showing that they don't, is so utterly bizarre.</p>
<p>So one of the problems with this whole thing is that people like you just want to see "sources" or "studies" telling you what to think. The evidence is in the raw data. It's readily available in multiple locations. Go to worldometers, or ourworldindata, or johnshopkins, or google, or one the countless other covid tracking sites out there. Pick a country, look at their case numbers. Then go and see what kind of restrictions were put in place and when. Do it to a bunch of countries. Look for reductions or changes in trajectories in case numbers. It requires work and time, but it's worth it. Look for patterns. Look for trends. Use your critical thinking skills. Don't go in with the assumption that masks must work. Go in with an open mind.</p>
<p>Here is a guy I follow on Twitter that has gone through the data and laid it out in an easily digestible way. <a href="https://twitter.com/ianmSC">https://twitter.com/ianmSC</a> .</p>
<p>I know you can find studies that say masks are helpful. Pretty much without exception, when you actually go through the studies with an open mind, you will notice the weak methodology and premature conclusions. Most are not even actual studies, but analysis of other studies done by other people that they then editorialize. Many of them are obviously attempts to add credibility after the fact to justify mask mandates, so they go in with a desired conclusion and cherry pick whatever evidence they can find to support their predetermined conclusion. But since you asked, here are some studies that show the ineffectiveness of masks. For the record, I don't find this kind of "study war" to be all that convincing or helpful, where I show you my study, then you pick it apart, and then show me your study, where I then go through and pick it apart, and so on and so on. There is plenty of scientific literature on both sides of the argument, and you can find a study to back up almost anything you want. The actual results of actual masking by the general public in the real world are much more convincing to me, but here you go.</p>

        <p>I quantify slightly through the percentage of reductions</p>
<p>A lot of the studies you sent said that masks make it difficult to breathe and whatnot but we already knew that, and thank you for sending me your studies </p>
<p>If in a couple years time it turns out that masks really don't make a difference when it comes to diseases like this and all the scientists agree, at least I know I was tying to do the right thing by everyone else, so would everybody else who wears masks. It's just wearing something over your mouth and nose for a few minutes or hours. I would wear mine for the whole 6 hours at school, 5-8 hours at work and 6-7 hours at uni. If you follow the guidelines, even if they turn out to be wrong, just means you wanted to do what was best for yourself and others. Im not a mask clinger or anything, I just want to follow the guidelines and try and prevent others from getting sick</p>
<p>And yeah victoria had the most strict lockdown, last year it was like 112 days over 2 lockdowns, but we were completely covid free since like October? To feb or something when some guy from NSW came down and infected us so we had a snap lockdown of 5 days and we were fine again right up until 2-3 weeks ago when there was a breach in SA hotel quarantine, but our lockdown ends soon anyway. We normally have 0 restrictions but we locked down and mask up to ensure we don't keep spreading the new variant. Our federal government failed at building a proper quarantine system and housing for returned travellers and failed at an effective vaccine rollout and failed at financially supporting people who've lost work due to lockdowns</p>
<p>The police only get involved if the person is positive and has breached quarantine. While our federal govt is pretty crap, our state government locks us down only when necessary to ensure that no more people die. Most of the time we are out of lockdown and maskless and don't really social distance because the only way for us to get covid is from overseas travellers. </p>
<p>It's our way of protecting others</p>

        <p>We don't need to wait years. We knew before 2020, and we know now. Masks do not have any measurable impact on slowing the spread of respiratory viruses like covid. There is a reason why in the last 50 years, never once were masks ever recommended (let alone required) to stop the spread of the multiple global pandemics that have happened over that time. Masks were well understood and readily available, and the experts could have recommended their usage, but they went out of their way to not only to not recommend them, but went as far as to advise against their usage by the general public. This is why in March of 2020, the Who, CDC, Anthony Fauci, and every expert in the world advised against people wearing masks. Hell, the recently released emails from Fauci are filled with him telling people not to wear masks. ALL the science prior to 2020 was clear that masks were not effective at stopping pandemics. And now after over a year of unprecedented mask usage throughout almost every country on earth, the data is even more clear that masks do not have any measurable impact on slowing the spread of covid. This year long, worldwide, mask experiment just confirms what was well known for years that masks do not work.</p>
<p>So here's the problem. I get the sentiment that you are just following guidelines, and ultimately your intentions are good, so it doesn't matter if masks work or not , its just a minor convenience with the noble goal to hopefully save lives. I get that. The problem is that mask mandates just normalize governments passing laws that aren't supported by data, evidence, or common sense. They are imposed upon people, regardless of whether the people agree with the measures or not, regardless of whether they are effective at all, regardless of the mountains of evidence showing that they don't work, and it is done through the gross abuse of authoritarian emergency powers, using fear, misinformation and peer pressure, to force people to behave a certain way, with no agreed upon end conditions or even methods to verify if the measures are doing anything at all. Masks are unnecessarily divisive, and their many negative cultural impacts are completely ignored, and any opposition is silenced and shamed. This is terrible on so many levels, yet people like you buy into it and think it's no big deal. Normalizing this type of fear based, anti-scientific, purely emotional, policy making should never be tolerated in any rational, democratic society. Never. But here we are.</p>
<p>You brush off a 112 day, hard core, police enforced, lockdown as if it is nothing. That's over 3 months. And in your mind you believe it was necessary and good. That is pure insanity. Covid is not remotely deadly for the vast majority of people, and even for the most vulnerable it is not even close to a death sentence. Australia's covid response is absolutely reckless and irrational based on the actual risk the disease poses. Please look at the actual data. There is not one bit of evidence that supports what Australia has done. It makes zero sense. It is such a ridiculous overraction it's hard to believe it's real. And look what it has done. It already has you blaming actual people from NSW and SA for causing lockdown and spreading a respiratory virus. Good lord. You talk about having 0 restrictions, yet when 1 case is detected the same harsh lockdowns are enacted all over again, which ultimately destroy entire industries and slowly kill normal, free thinking societies. And this has happened multiple times. This is not normal, and you should not tolerate such nonsense. The looming threat of irrational, draconian lockdowns, all over 1 positive case of a relatively harmless virus, with multiple effective vaccines and treatments, is absurd. That is not living life with 0 restrictions. That is a ridiculous dystopia. And Australia has basically shut itself off from the rest of the world, and there is no end in sight. It has imprisoned its own citizens and convinced them that it's justified and for their own good. And all of it is based on basically no empirical evidence.</p>
<p>Your way is not protecting anyone. It is normalizing tyranny, pseudoscience, and insanity. You are being manipulated.</p>

        <p>One of the links I sent you was from 2008 and showed that masks work, but oh well. People wore masks during the Spanish flu and during the black plague doctors wore those bird like ones. People from Asian cultures wear masks whenever they have a simple cold to protect others from catching what they have </p>
<p>And science changes all the time. Doctors thought that prescribing cocaine was good for a headache lmao but now we know it's not fantastic. Fauci did do a massive 180 but there is the potential for masks to work, so it's not super bad</p>
<p>I don't blame NSW it's just a fact. I don't blame SA for the current outbreak, it's just a fact that there was a breach despite doing all the right things. I blame ScoMo for sitting on his ass and that one vic guy who was showing symptoms for a week and held interviews and only got tested after everyone else was becoming positive. We don't lockdown after 1 case, we lock down after around 20-30 to ensure we run it to the ground. It may be an overreaction but we have a fairly small population compared to US states and over 50 deaths and 700 new cases in one day is a lot for us. The rest of Aus is doing alright and they all have 3-7 day lockdowns as well whenever there is an outbreak</p>
<p>The police barely enforced the lockdown, people i know were travelling well over 80km to see people for work, well above the 5km and 25km limits</p>
<p>I do understand the enforcing masks can possibly set a precedent for our govts. to enforce more rules like that, but we aren't required to wear them all the time when cases are low/zero. We do have an end in sight when the majority of people are vaccinated, much like what is happening in the US how restrictions are easing as more people get vaxxed and cases drop. We've closed off our borders to most other countries, except for ones we have 'bubbles' with, to ensure we don't have massive outbreaks again</p>
