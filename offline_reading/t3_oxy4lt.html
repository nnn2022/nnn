    <strong>Trying to talk to these pro mask / lockdown people is just infuriating</strong>
    <p><p>So I was supposed to get married in June 2020.  Obviously that didn't go through thanks to lockdowns.  Several reschedules later, now it is supposed to be next month.  Things were looking fine until Illinois' Governor Fatty decided to do the whole mask mandate nonsense and threaten to shut things down.</p>
<p>I get into a discussion with my mother over this shit, (something I have told myself to stop doing, but I am too hot-headed), and I tell her how this whole thing is completely asinine - how our moronic government is dictating policy because some 6,000 vaccinated people got breakthrough infections.  6,000 people....out of 161,0000,000 vaccinated Americans.  Fucking bananas.</p>
<p>Of course her mental gymnastics kicks in and says the normal talking points: "EvEn OnE DeAtH iS tOo MuCh!" and "iT nEvEr ShOuLd HaVe GoTtEn ThIs BaD!" (of course implying that the previous administration did not do enough to combat it  - cause, you know, orange man bad.)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Talking with these people, despite throwing actual statistics at them, and them just being too stubborn to question the narrative is infuriating.</p></p>

        <p>It is a good point...A lot of people died as a result of these policies through ODs and suicides, etc..  I am not sure the numbers and that would be a good thing to look at, but I am sure it is a pretty strong ratio.</p>

        <p>Normally, I would 100% agree with you that truth is what wins the war.  But I tell ya, it really seems like these people are immune to the truth.  I don't know if it is the mainstream media feeding them bullshit or what.  Perhaps after years of not having to think critically has made them lose the ability.</p>
<p>Just this timeline of events alone makes me question people's ability to even grasp the truth:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hearing the president say that "we must mask up to protect the vaccinated"</li>
<li>He cites CDC data to make this claim</li>
<li>the data cited shows that 161 million people are vaccinated</li>
<li>the data cited shows that roughly 6 thousand vaccinated people have had breakthrough infections</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I am no mathmagician,  but 6,000 / 161,000,000 is an astronomically low number.  And if <em>that</em> number is what we are using as a crisis point, then the whole world has gone mad.</p>

        <p>I hate to say it, but honestly it is almost as if it is willful ignorance.  They are too willfully ignorant to understand <em>basic data analysis</em> of the COVID numbers.  How can they be assumed able to do simple math analysis?</p>

        <p>There are 6 times more people experiencing famine and starvation in the world. If you look at the death counts throughout the world, there aren't even that many Covid deaths in third world countries. But they are starving to death in those countries. How the hell is that humanitarian?</p>
<p>So many news articles are incredibly misleading when they talk about an "Increase in Deaths" during Covid in the U.S.A. They talk about how so many more people are dying on average during this Covid crisis, but only mention once or twice that actual Covid is only accounting for, at most, a third of the increased deaths. That means that at least 66% of the extra deaths are due to other things. And pro-vaxxers think that wishing death and suffering on those who disagree with them helps things. "Even one death is too much". I wonder how many people pro-vaxxers and the Covid hysteria has pushed to suicide? There is plenty of blood on the pro-vaxxers hands.</p>

        <p>The thing about it is that it doesn't matter to them what side of politics you are. I do not fit the usual profile of an anti-vaxxer, but that never stops a Covid hysteria victim from stereotyping us and assuming we must be stupid. When all of there arguments about vaccines fall through, they will invoke the "We are protecting our children!".</p>
<p>The idea of "Even one death is too much" falls apart too when they reach bringing up children . In 2015, more children died of Pneumonia in a single day (on average as well) than in this entire pandemic. I would really love to know how many Covid warriors got their pneumonia vaccine before Covid. Anyone who did not and says that anti-covid vaccine people are putting children at risk are complete hypocrites.</p>

<p>The “even one death is too much argument” is exhausting because we’ve battled how many diseases for centuries? And how many debilitating diseases don’t even get proper recognition (like Lyme disease, for example). And people are basically screaming at each other over covid at this point (which for people under the age of 50 still has less than a 1% mortality rate in the U.S.).</p>
