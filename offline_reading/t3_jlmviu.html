    <strong>Daily Mail’s Lamest Attempt Yet at a Cover Up: “Has Covid killed off the flu? Experts pose the intriguing question as influenza cases nosedive by 98% across the globe“</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>Many feared 'twin-demic' of flu, which kills thousands, and Covid-19 this winter</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Thirty million people - 20 per cent more than normal - now eligible for the flu jab</strong></li>
<li><strong>'Surveillance' data collected by WHO shows how flu cases plummeted globally</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“Globally, it is estimated that rates of flu may have plunged by 98 per cent compared with the same time last year.</p>
<p><strong>'This is real,</strong>' says Dr David Strain, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School. 'There's no doubt that we're seeing far fewer incidences of flu.'</p>
<p>So where has flu gone? And what does it mean for our winter?</p>
<p>There are intriguing theories – some more outlandish than others.</p>
<p>There are those who claim flu cases haven't vanished at all, but are instead being recorded as Covid-19. Sceptics say Covid tests are unable to distinguish between coronavirus and flu, but this is simply untrue...</p>
<p>There's no chance <strong>of mistaking one</strong> for the other – the fragment of viral genetic material from the coronavirus looks like a bit of spaghetti, while the flu genetic material we test for looks like eight pieces of penne pasta.'</p>
<p>Another compelling explanation suggests the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 and has run rampant throughout the world, has somehow 'crowded out' the flu virus.“</p></p>

        <p>The simple truth of the matter is that they are not counting flu cases (per the CDC) and have bunched the flu along with covid cases. The further truth is coronavirus causes the common cold and if you take a look at the symptoms of both the flu and covid, they are one in the same :)</p>

        <p>I know two people who were positive for flu and covid because their doctor tested for both. Unless we start testing anyone who comes in for a covid test for the flu as well, we have no way of knowing.</p>

        <p>SS:</p>
<p>Apparently we need an expert to tell us “this is real”. Certainly hard to believe otherwise...</p>
<p>While pushing the flu jab in a bullet point non sequitur, they do at least address the most likely justification for the almost total absence of the flu this year. They rightly point out it would be hard to “mistake” COVID for the flu, but they don’t address the already-proven fact of wilful conflation, or supersession of one over the other, at least in the minds of highly-incentivised medical “professionals”.</p>
<p>Marks taken off for pushing the ludicrous “twin-demic” narrative and for lack of elaboration on the specifics of “surveillance“ data.</p>

        <p>more propaganda</p>
<p>the cdc isn't compiling the reports and i reckon all the other nation states equivalents aren't as well</p>
<p>the state that enslaves me still counts and tracks p/i cases and deaths though.</p>
<p>For week 41 (2nd week) of the current influenza season: </p>
<p>5.3% of all deaths that occurred in Hawaii during week 41were related to pneumonia or influenza. For the current season (season to date: 8.0%), there have been 300 deaths from any cause, 24 of which were due to P&amp;I.</p>
<p>last year's flu season claimed 780 out of 11,638 deaths from all causes. fake ass 'covid19' claimed 192</p>
