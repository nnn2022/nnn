        <p>The propaganda networks have slowly ingrained tribalism in society for years and this is where to rubber meets the road...</p>
<p>The constant barrage almost daily done by the propaganda networks, if you're against mask and attend a protest denouncing tyranny, you're an extreme right wing racist nazi... This is where the tribalism propaganda theory gets tested out.</p>
<p>The people who vote left but don't agree with the ideology of authoritarian/tyrant governments and depopulation, regular humans non socialist who votes left, do they accept this fucking non sense cause their "team" is the one enacting it?</p>
<p>Tribalism propaganda has been around for a long time, I believe it's being tested as we speak and you can see it's not as effective as they thought. In the US for example, there is a shit load of people openly claiming they voted democrat a long time and are voting for Trump this year because the democrats have become delusional.</p>

        <p>Tribalism isn't the end, it's the means.</p>
<p>The goal is a mocha-coloured society of compliant drones, with all culture erased and replaced by international corporate logos, chanting of approved mantras about unicorns, rainbows, and "fairness" - and mindless consumption of product.</p>
<p>We will be a herd of livestock - penned, tagged, counted, and fed. Until it is time, as with all herds of livestock, to perform a cull.</p>
<p>Then the world will be a giant version of Brazil - elites nestled in houses upon the hill, a small class of experts and techs to keep the luxury goods flowing and the lights on, and a mass of disenfranchised peons living in the stinking favelas in the valley.</p>
<p>To get there, the elites must destroy the present society - by turning everyone against each other - politics, philosophy, religion, the environment, anarcho-tyranny, the welfare state clients vs those who pay the bills but have no say. A society of atomized individuals is too busy with it's own internecine warfare to see what is happening and fight back.</p>
<p>D<em>ivide</em> et impera is as true now as it was in ancient Rome.</p>

        <p>That's a more pessimistic view then I have. I believe tyranny will be defeated, the "new normal" great reset/depopulation agenda is insane, it's not compatible with modern society...</p>
<p>Every living thing on earth has a basic survival mechanism, generally speaking, nobody wants to die... The "new normal" is not compatible with human rights, or for the benefit of mankind, the idea of depopulation is insane. It's counter intuitive to believe once people find out about the truth within the next few years, they will still gladly go along with the great reset.</p>
<p>Once general AI has been achieved in 20-30 years +, considering where super computers will be at that time, it will game over for the vast majority of humans. Humanity will have become worthless and over powered by the deep state and the robot enforcers.</p>
