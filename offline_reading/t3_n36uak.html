    <strong>How bad is life in Pennsylvania?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm just curious how life is in counties like Lancaster and Lebanon counties. We recently moved to TX. We really enjoy TX (wayyy more expensive than we thought) however we realized we moved to an area that is kind of out of our element in terms of the people, we don't really fit in (we fit in politically but not background). We are considering moving either to another part of TX or PA. Why PA? Well, one of my best friends and his wife are moving there to one of those counties. Having a friend like that around the corner is a really great thought and will help out my wife in the sense that she will have someone to talk to and spend time with outside of the house. On the negative, PA has a garbage governor and ridiculous laws. The governor says he won't impose vaccine passports now but what happens if throws a fit that not everyone wants his labrat vaccine? I'm kind of afraid of vaccine passports and we are pretty used to in TX being able to go to 85% of places without masks and seeing people hate this garbage.  </p>
<p>I have to say it's really ridiculous that this has to become a factor in major life decisions.  I grew up in a blue state and generally, in keeping to my own town and county, that really didn't have a huge effect on me (other than taxes). Now I have to worry about disgusting things like "if this bastard does vaccine passports, will that preclude me from a job since there is so much government work in the area?"</p></p>
