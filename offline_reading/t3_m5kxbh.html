    <strong>We Have Woken Up in an Era of Abandoned Reason</strong>
    <p><p>I feel many of us are tirelessly fighting to keep sound science straight and we have woken up in an alternate timeline, bizarro world, if you will. It's almost as if everything we have come to reason about in society as a whole is inside out and upside down, up for debate, many of us begging our loved ones to look at the facts to be met with mocking and shaming. Clearly, all of us understand that something extraordinary is happening before our eyes.</p>
<p>The Georgia Guidestones have always been a topic of interest to me, but it always seemed very far off and confusing when I read what is written on them.</p>
<p>Now, they are beginning to resonate with me. I have felt an impending sense of doom for the last 10 years of my life and I've never been able to put my finger on the reason why:</p>
<p>We are being mocked for expecting due process when threatened with mandatory experimental chemicals. We are being shamed for being skeptical when DOUBT is the essence of science itself. Being skeptical IS REASONING.</p>
<p>This is just something I am speculating upon, and I am curious if anyone else feels the same way.</p>
<p>In June 1979, a man using the pseudonym R. C. Christian approached the Elberton Granite Finishing Company on behalf of "a small group of loyal Americans", and commissioned the structure. Christian explained that the stones would function as a compass, calendar, and clock, and should be capable of "withstanding catastrophic events". Joe Fendley of Elberton Granite assumed that Christian was "a nut" and attempted to discourage him by providing a quote for the commission which was several times higher than any project the company had previously taken, explaining that the guidestones would require additional tools and consultants. To Fendley's surprise, Christian accepted the quote. When arranging payment, Christian said that he represented a group which had been planning the guidestones for 20 years and which wanted to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>The monument stands at an approximate elevation of 750 feet (230 m) above sea level, about 90 miles (140 km) east of Atlanta, 45 miles (72 km) from Athens, Georgia and 9 miles (14 km) north of the center of the city of Elberton.
One slab stands in the center, with four arranged around it. A capstone lies on top of the five slabs, which are astronomically aligned. An additional stone tablet, which is set in the ground a short distance to the west of the structure, provides some notes on the history and purpose of the guidestones. The structure is sometimes referred to as an "AmericanThe monument is 19 feet 3 inches (5.87 m) tall, made from six granite slabs weighing 237,746 pounds (107,840 kg) in all.</p>
<p>The anonymity of the guidestones' authors and their apparent advocacy of population control, eugenics, and internationalism have made them an object of controversy and conspiracy theories. (Search Bill Gates Newspaper 2011 Forced Vaccines and Depopulation)</p>
<p>A message consisting of a set of ten guidelines or principles is engraved on the Georgia Guidestones in eight different languages, one language on each face of the four large upright stones. Moving clockwise around the structure from due north, these languages are: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Traditional Chinese, and Russian.</p>
<p>Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.</p>
<p>Guide reproduction wisely — improving fitness and diversity.</p>
<p>Unite humanity with a living new language.</p>
<p>Rule passion — faith — tradition — and all things with tempered reason.</p>
<p>Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts.</p>
<p>Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court.</p>
<p>Avoid petty laws and useless officials.</p>
<p>Balance personal rights with social duties.</p>
<p>Prize truth — beauty — love — seeking harmony with the infinite.</p>
<p>Be not a cancer on the Earth — Leave room for nature — Leave room for nature.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that everything these people have abandoned reason, freedom and accountability for have reported things that are the complete opposite of what we knew to be sound facts. Opposite Day. Bizarro World. We all see it. </p>
<p>Immediately below this is the outline of a square, inside which is written:</p>
<p>Let these be guidestones to an Age of Reason</p>
<p>Stay away from people who have been shot up with this abomination for a while if you can. My intuition has been screaming this to me since this started.</p>

        <p>Humans in general are not reasonable creatures.   They are easily manipulated and herded.    Edward Bernays, the founder of modern marketing, developed some of the techniques that work today as well as they did a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Wealthy people are trying to manipulate society to their benefit.  They always have.   Rockefeller helped found and promote the modern education system to benefit himself.  He wanted better workers in his factories and offices.</p>
<p>Humans are hierarchical.  They seek approval from the Alpha.   Government has become that Alpha for many people.   And one way to seek approval is to berate anyone going against the Alpha.   </p>
<p>The world is working much the same as it always has.  It's just moving faster and more noticeable now because we can communicate much more quickly than in the past.</p>
<p>What it means for us?   Hang on and stay true to self.   Always strive to remember who you really are.</p>
