        <p>Thank you. I see some valid sources and some not so valid sources, but whatever. I'd just like to point out, that science, especially medical science, is constantly evolving as we learn new information. Things that were once thought true, say, on October 18 2016, may not be true now in 2021 because additional testing, studies etc have been done. Therefore, it is the responsible decision to remove the study rather than misinform people with outdated information. In fact, a lot of the reason why the whackos like you and the rest of this sub subscribe so fiercely to every conspiracy theory regarding this pandemic is that you cannot grasp that humanity doesn't have all the answers. Why was a vaccine created so quickly? Because the entire world started pumping money into research that needed to happen quickly before this virus got out of control. The CDC released guidance based on the quantifiable information available at the time. Are they 100% sure of their findings? Of course not, but they've got much better data and equipment to make their decisions than a bunch of assholes on Reddit. We don't have the time to study the virus and the vaccine for decades. People (PEOPLE, HUMAN BEINGS WITH FAMILIES AND LIVES) are dying. Spare me the 99.9951935% whatever the fuck survival rate you chodes have come up with and your endless strawmen. We're 100% fuckin' winging it, bud.</p>

        <p>It absolutely does 180 if the evidence calls for it. Creationism and flat earth are caveman theories that have been debunked for a very long time so I'm not sure what you're trying to say. My point is just fine without the insults, I just added them because you absolutely 100% deserve it.</p>

        <p>This is ridiculous based on what he’s saying, and it doesn’t even make the point you think it does. </p>
<p>If there was a peer-reviewed, scientific study done tomorrow that suggested that Earth was created 6,000 years ago by God then scientists would either agree, or replicate the studies research to see if they came to a similar result. If they did, they agree, if not then they dispute the findings. </p>
<p>Science was under the impression that cloth masks did little to prevent the spread of viruses because viruses are very small and can easily get in between the holes in masks. When an actual experiment was done to test this <strong>hypothesis</strong> scientists determined that viruses are generally transferred through saliva or mucus that is natural when talking. Cloth masks absolutely prevent the spread of these bodily fluids which, in turn, can spread the virus. </p>
<p>Now, I understand what sub I’m on and get that the majority of you reading this disagree. If that’s you, <a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/v1?fbclid=IwAR0XQTr11EM2n3xGsxmR1FGLNnjYLZgaysxyVMgRQOjkgRdT7knoGPir4NE">here</a> is the study I am referencing. Instead of making a rude reply to this comment you are welcome to do your own study to refute their claims 🤣</p>

        <p>Firstly, politically motivated science isn't actual science and their findings aren't relevant :). Secondly you've shown at best there is disagreement on mask use, so how does "Masks maybe work maybe make things worse" lead to "wear a mask or you're an anti science barbarian who deserve to lose your job"</p>

        <p>Do you have some evidence to suggest that the article I posted that lists the methodology, data, and results so it can be replicated by other scientists is politically motivated? Furthermore, do you have any peer reviewed data that suggests the opposite? </p>

        <p>I reject “studies” that are cherry picked articles by former Trump officials trying to justify the decisions they made that costs thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people their lives. </p>
<p>I’ve provided you with the one study here that is a peer-reviewed study on masks and how they prevent the spread of COVID. Unless and until you provide evidence to suggest otherwise you’re just some random person on the internet speculating. </p>
<p>I’m done talking to you because it’s clear that you have no actual evidence that backs up your claims. Anyone who is reading this is more than welcome to make their own decision on who to follow: a consensus of millions of scientists and healthcare professionals who have dedicated their lives to healing people; OR u/FreedomIsFascist and Donald Trump, a known conman and grifter.

        <p>I’ve provided evidence, bud, you did not. One person here is interested in the truth and that person is the one quoting full scientific articles not snippets and screenshots. </p>
<p>If you’re so interested in truth show me the evidence. I’m always open to being proven wrong. It’s happened before and it will happen again, but not by you, at least not in an argument about this. </p>
<p>If you really don’t like Trump and you’re out here parroting his talking points and pushing narratives from people in his administration I feel  bad for you. You should look into things more before posting about things you clearly do not understand.</p>

        <p>I know you're probably not used to critical thinking, but not everything is absolutes. As it turns out, there's a happy middle ground that involves practicing simple things like hygiene and wearing a mask that can prevent unnecessary deaths. That's like saying "don't disarm that bomb, people die all the time".  </p>
<p>Basically, the difference is that these deaths are in fact preventable.</p>

        <p>Masks are recommended for asthma. They're absolutely soaked in pollen after a day oiutside but they work because the pollen that's on the outside of them isn't irritating the lungs. Simple enough.</p>
<p>The reverse is true for Coronavirus, someone who is sick will cough and the virus particles will get caught on the *inside* of their mask. Wearing a mask to prevent yourself from getting the rona is way less relevant than someone who is actually sick wearing one. Although it still helps and as such its the norm in a lot of Asian countries to wear a mask when you have a cold or the flu so you don't spread it to everyone else.</p>

        <p>You realize thousands of people go outside every day and unknowingly spread viruses and diseases? You do realize there are people who have worn a mask every time they went into public well before Covid? Do you know why those people wore their own mask, and didn’t go screaming at other perfectly healthy people to wear one too? It’s because THEY are at risk. THEY want to make sure they don’t get sick. You can’t look at anyone and tell whether or not they’re carrying a a dangerous virus. Should we just require every person on the planet to wear a mask for the rest of eternity to protect everyone from the unknown?</p>

        <p>Mhmm maybe it's because the long term side effects could cripple our work force for a whole generation. Let's not also forget nobody wants to get sick cause some jerk is selfish can't think of anybody but them selves. So what if you won't die supposedly but then the possibility of you getting some one sick and them dieing doesn't bother you then we obvious will never see eye to eye and this planet is doomed to fail due to the selfishness . How would you feel if you got your friend sick and in turn his mother got sick and died.  Her death would be on you hands. Would that not bother you?</p>

        <p>Why did my friend go around his at risk mother before testing himself for Covid? My point. I’m responsible. I don’t go around those who are at risk because I’ve been in this day one. I would tell those same loved ones to not go out in public if they want to blame others for catching a virus. Protect yourself.</p>
<p>The person who is irresponsible is not the person who shows no signs of being sick, the one who is irresponsible is going out in public with a known health concern that puts them at risk for serious complications for Covid when we have so many alternative options nowadays to having to go out in public for needed items. Damn near every store still open offers delivery or curbside pickup.</p>
<p>If Covid only affected say people with a B negative blood type, would we quarantine those with A positive blood so that those with B negative blood wouldn’t feel excluded from not having to quarantine? No. That would be stupid.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic people don't show symptoms which is why it's important to wear masks. It seems like that aspect keeps going over your head. If you were not showing symptoms and he hung out around you and then he is in his Asymptomatic time period around his mother how was he to know he was infected?  Your arguments are dumb and counterintuitive and shows your lack of care to anybody but your self. Anti maskers are sociopaths . You seriously need to get checked and I hope nobody innocent get sick and dies from the selfishness of you.</p>

        <p>So are we blaming me for spreading it to my friend, blaming the friend for not wearing a mask around me/making me wear a mask, or blaming the friends mother for not wearing a mask/making him wear a mask? Or are we blaming Donald Trump along with the other 500k Covid deaths he single handedly caused?</p>
<p>Also who’s to say the mask would’ve even been effective? </p>
<p>Until we see a court case about charging someone with unintentionally spreading a virus, I guess you’ll just have to throw blame at whoever you want.</p>
<p>Also, you claim I’m an antimasker yet I’ve worn a mask in every single establishment that’s required me to with no questions asked since last March. Far from being anti mask, however I am 100% anti stupidity. And masks aren’t even very effective in preventing the spread of Covid 19. You can’t blame someone for spreading something when the “required item to prevent from spreading” (mask) isn’t even close to being 100% effective at stopping it.</p>

        <ul>
<li>
<p>"It should be concluded from these and similar studies that the filter material of face masks does not retain or filter out viruses." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Yet there is no convincing scientific data that supports the effectiveness of masks for respiratory protection" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Masks will always fit fairly loosely with considerable gaps along the cheeks, around the bridge of the nose and along the bottom edge of the mask below the chin." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Focusing on universal masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated."' </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"There have been extensive randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies, and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators do not work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H)." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"A total of six RCTs involving 9,171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"In light of the medical research, therefore, it is difficult to understand why public-health authorities are not consistently adamant about this established scientific result, since the distributed psychological, economic, and environmental harm from a broad recommendation to wear masks is significant, not to mention the unknown potential harm from concentration and distribution of pathogens on and from used masks. In this case, public authorities would be turning the precautionary principle on its head" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"By making mask-wearing recommendations and policies for the general public, or by expressly condoning the practice, governments have both ignored the scientific evidence and done the opposite of following the precautionary principle." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"So, at the end of the day, the only thing that provides personal protection for the person wearing the mask is a respirator. And that is the thing that healthcare workers should be wearing" </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"My biggest problem with telling people they can wear masks is it gives you this false sense of security. And it might even encourage you to think that now you’re protected and you’re protecting people around you." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"just want them to understand that they aren’t very much more protective than if they weren’t wearing them. And they’re really not doing a whole lot of good for the people around them." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"the wide use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not supported by current evidence and carries uncertainties and critical risks.” </p>

        <p>It can if it’s covered in whatever virus causes said disease. I can assure you thousands of cases of Covid were spread through the soles of shoes, and all over pants and shirts. And I can all but assure you thousands of cases of Covid happened due to someone constantly touching their face/improperly wearing a mask.</p>
