    <strong>Coffee Bean requires masks IN THE DRIVE-THROUGH!</strong>
    <p><p>Needed to rant about this. The other day I wanted to get coffee for a friend and walked to the Coffee Bean down the street. Despite being allowed to be open for "take out" under current restrictions, this Coffee Bean wasn't; only drive-through. So I had to go back and get my friend's car. When I pulled up to the window to pay and get the coffee, the barista pointed to a sign on the window saying "Masks Required," and yelled at me to put on a mask. I WAS IN THE DRIVE-THROUGH, IN A CAR. I normally keep masks in my own car, but I was driving a friend's car, and surely thought I wouldn't need one IN A DRIVE-THROUGH. I shouted that I did not have a mask, and the barista shrugged and refused to open the window. I explained that I was OUTSIDE and don't need a mask, but the barista said it didn't matter. Frustrated as hell, I finally pulled my shirt up over my nose and shouted, "How about now? Same thing as a cloth mask." The barista checked with his manager, and finally opened the window and allowed my to buy the coffee while holding my shirt up over my nose. I will never go to a Coffee Bean again.</p></p>

        <p>I'd just boycott with my wallet.  There's plenty of other mexican and coffee places to get take-out.  I will wear a mask inside to stores even though I don't enjoy it.  There's no way I'd put one on for a drive-thru.</p>

        <p>I’m also in LA. I had to boycott my local Habit because of their idiotic policies. They allow you to order inside (with a mask on of course), but then you are required to wait outside for your food to be prepared. They ask for your phone number and then text you when it is ready. No shade anywhere. 100+ degree weather recently. Standing outside like a dog. Why when there is more than enough room indoors to social distance? Makes no sense. </p>
<p>This is the only restaurant in the area with such a policy. Fuck them. Never going back.</p>

        <p>This is ridiculous. The drive through and curbside pickup are the only options they give <em>for</em> people who can’t wear masks at many businesses. To not even give this option? Not okay. I’d report them for not making reasonable accommodations (with no added hardship to the business). I know we’re not specifically talking about a med exemption here, but as far as they know you could have had one</p>

        <p>I think most laws are to prevent litigation. I don't see why businesses can't just put up a sign that says "enter at your own risk, you're out in public and might catch a cold." Every store and product in California has a sign saying it gives you cancer. And people will give this slave made crap to their children to play with because the news doesn't tell them to be scared about childhood cancer nonstop.</p>

        <p>Back in April, I went to a Sonic Drive-In while traveling. I sometimes go to one near my home and it had been operating normally. I pulled up to one of the stalls and tried to order, but the employee explained that it's not safe to operate the regular drive-in. They were drive-thru only, for my safety.</p>
<p>Now, for those unfamiliar, with normal service a carhop will run the food out to your car and pass it to you through the window. In the drive thru, you order at a menu board and then...a car hop runs the food out to your car and passes it through the window.</p>
<p>I said "No thanks," and drove across town to another Sonic. It was operating normally (unsafely?). Some guidelines are sketchy, and some operators have gone off the deep end trying to over-comply.</p>
<p>At a McDonalds recently, I had another weird experience. I was about to pay, but before I could hand my payment to the employee, she hands me the credit card machine through the window so I can run my own card. I guess they are safe from touching my debit card and only have to handle the hard-to-clean point-of-sale equipment that I just had inside my car and touched with my hands? Meanwhile at my home McDonalds, they don't seem to care at all anymore and the employees are back to being chatty and friendly. No gloves to handle the payments, some half-hearted masks. I'm sure someone will bust them for it eventually, but at least it's nice while it lasts.</p>

        <p>Lol yeah. Along with the crap where they hand the food or credit card back to you using a plastic container. And they’re not consistent, they’ll only do the plastic container with the food or the credit card, not both. And it’s so random that I wonder if it’s certain employees asking to do it that way because they’re just extra paranoid and illogical.</p>

        <p>I never wear a mask when ordering at my local TB. No one has said a thing. Even in LA. They won’t touch your credit card though and slide the food out the window on a tray. Lol. Feels like prison. </p>
<p>Is that supposed to make me feel safe? As if people back there didn’t touch my food to prepare it? These rules are so idiotic and make no sense. I don’t understand how people blindly comply with them.</p>

        <p>Can I ask what state or country you are in?</p>
<p>Here in Texas I have counted 3 stores that have refused me service. Every other business I have been in (which is dozens) has not even batted an eye at my maskless face.</p>
<p>I haven't worn a mask once since this all started. And I am having very little trouble living life normally. Almost everyone else is wearing a mask out in public though, which is pretty depressing.</p>

        <p>Went to a brewery that was closed except for drive thru. Good to support local businesses, so pulled up and requested two 6 packs. The masked "runner" proceeded inside and came back and handed us the beer. The masked order taker gimp told us the price, and we tried to hand him cash. He told us,  "Noooo, nooo, we don't take cash because of the virus." We asked WHY? and handed back the beer. (Should've just driven away with it). Will NEVER be back to that brewery and will NEVER purchase their beer in the stores. Imagine you're hurting for business and you REFUSE a customer? That's payment discrimination. And they can fuck off.</p>
