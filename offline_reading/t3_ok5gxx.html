    <strong>My son will never see his grandpa again.</strong>
    <p><p>February 2020 was the last time they spent any real time together. Over the year he would see him here and there with masks, visit at the car or outside the house. My mother’s husband is the only grandpa he really knows. My son is the only person on the planet who loves that man without condition.</p>
<p>The man is under 60 years old, has a heart condition, diabetes, he’s overweight and he had a knee replacement several years ago he never did anything he was supposed to for and is now losing the leg. These are the real reasons he doesn’t want to see my son. He’s dying and he’s spent the last 15 years sitting in a chair drinking extra large slurpies doing fuck all about it. But now that we’ve decided not to vaccinate, it’s our fault he won’t see him.</p>
<p>He found a way to blame the outside world for his imminent death. We are selfish and irresponsible for not getting the vaccine. The kids not even old enough to get it but that apparently isn’t relevant. He also no longer thinks it safe to see us with masks, even though that was fine before.</p>
<p>For someone whose so certain we’re wrong for wanting to wait to see how this whole thing pans out, he doesn’t have a lot of confidence in it providing himself any protection.</p>
<p>People are fucked and my kid will never see his grandpa again.</p></p>

        <p>I feel your pain.  My injected 92yo grandmother is slowly slipping away mentally, has spent the last year lamenting she doesn't get to see my children, her grandchildren, any more, but her daughter (my aunt) has told her she can't be around people who haven't taken an experimental gene therapy, so she won't even let them see her.</p>
<p>They're 2 and 4, and aren't eligible (and wouldn't get it if they could).  The younger one will never know her, and the older will simply forget he ever did.</p>

        <p>A bit morbid, but it’s things like this that make me somewhat glad my grandfather passed in 2019. Can only imagine what it would have been like for him dying in isolation. Glad he didn’t.</p>

        <p>Would he have though?  I know my family, the ones I see most of the time, didn't change a thing throughout all this. We still did dinners, get togethers, holidays were the same, cookouts, whatever.  Not sure about your situation, or if he was in a nursing home (god forbid..) so may not have had a choice, but we did nothing different because there was no reason to.</p>

<p>There's probably a reason this society pushes elders away from their grandkids. Makes changing the culture go faster when old people aren't around to teach their grandkids their ways.</p>
<p>Kinda like the reverse of what canada did with residential schools, but in slow motion, and against all of society rather than a specific  group.</p>

        <p>So let me get this straight.</p>
<p>He is dying, but is afraid of getting COVID?</p>
<p>What, is COVID like "super death", "double death"?</p>
<p>Also, once again, vaccination protects THE PERSON WHO GETS THE VACCINE.</p>
<p>The idea that the vaccine helps you to protect others is completely unscientific and bullshit.</p>
<p>My guess is, your son is probably better not seeing his grandpa, if grandpa is completely insane, and could be a negative influence in his live.</p>
<p>If he wants to die alone, that's his thing, he can blame you, but you know it is his own decision.</p>

        <p>Yes yes and yes. My allowance of their relationship was tentative at best, but he wasn’t bad at grandpa-ing, this is it for us. I am not responsible for the condition he allowed himself to get in and neither is my son. He will die with only my mother as he has alienated everyone else.</p>

        <p>To his credit, if he’s old and in poor health covid is a lot more serious. Heck, the flu can be serious (a few years ago the flu killed like 100k in a year, although it usually hovers around 40k).</p>
<p>That said he needs to learn to respect other people’s decisions and operate within reasonable boundaries</p>

        <p>Yeah, it’s tremendously sad either way. It’s not too terribly uncommon for people, once they know they’re about to die, to become completely unreasonable/not know how to handle the situation. Some of the top posts on r/asktransgender are people who, after a terminal diagnosis with a short window, renounce their families to start hormones and dream about living life again as a girl or whatever.</p>
<p>If he lost his foot and only has a year or two left to live, he might just become completely unreasonable. It won’t matter that the kid is too young to vaccinate or whether you’re wearing a full hazmat suit, he’s just having trouble facing reality.</p>
<p>I’m of course saying this not because I know how to handle the situation, I don’t, but because he’s still family, and a lot of random internet people are going to tell you to dump him because they want to win a culture war</p>

        <p>I hear you 100%, I tried not to make my feeling about grandpa effect my sons relationship with him. He was a good grandpa, taught him lots, played with him all the time, they communicated really well and had a strong relationship. It was all about the kid stuff and that was okay with me. </p>
<p>The toxic behaviour was for himself and the rest of the adults but with my kid it was different and I allowed them to maintain a relationship. Had I known all of this would happen and he would forsake his relationship with his grandson for 2 more miserable years sitting on his ass on this earth, I would have done different.</p>

        <p>None of us can ever know what the future holds, so you can't beat yourself up for doing what you thought was best for your child.</p>
<p>What you can do, IMO, though, is make sure your child isn't subjected to this man's negative behavior anymore as, if he is this obsessed with vaccines, he is likely to attempt to persuade your child to think the same way. And that will never end well.</p>

        <p>Yep. I know people like that, I've had to 'abandon' (guilt trippers would say) some friends and even family members due to their continued self-destruction - they almost enjoyed making me watch them do it.. for sympathy or manipulation or otherwise.</p>
<p>I helped them best I could, encouraged them best I could, showed them with my own actions and example when overcoming adversity - nope was never enough.. just a big black hole of 'poor me and watch me kill myself'.. and doing nothing on their own accord to improve their situation.</p>
<p>So I left them behind. I grieved as though they had died, and moved on with my life, wishing them well.</p>

        <p>And he didn’t do any physiotherapy, put all the weight back on that he had to lose to get the surgery and did a ton of heavy lifting and going up and down ladders working on personal projects (he’s a project guy who never finishes anything and the house is borderline hoarder), just generally not doing what he should and doing what he shouldn’t. Now with the combination of it not healing properly, his heart not being able to get blood where it’s supposed to because it’s weak and he’s gigantic, and the diabetes, the leg is dying. He’s actually losing both feet, but the whole one leg is nearly done.</p>

        <p>They play video games together a couple hours a month and talk on the phone occasionally but it’s not at all the same and while my son expresses over and over again that he wants to hang out with them, see them. He deflects and avoids and I finally just told him myself what’s going on (in the vaguest of terms) despite being asked not to. My mother just backs up whatever her husband says and I’m not letting my kid think his grandparents just don’t want to see him anymore.</p>

<p>Luckily they did manage to be together as the symptoms got weaker. But I'm not sure for how long the old man is going to be able to make it.</p>

        <p>It won’t. Most of us are healthy with strong immune systems and strong minds. The fact that you want the independent thinkers to die for being nonconformists really says a lot. In fact, your intolerance and bigotry towards people who refuse to be lab rats does nothing but reinforce our position and make us MORE opposed to getting an experimental shot. So please, keep it up so more people will refuse it. Just goes to show the level of brainwashing we’re up against. ;)</p>
