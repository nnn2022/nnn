    <strong>How far back did the planning for COVID go?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m becoming increasingly convinced it goes back as far as 50 years.</p>
<p>I’d love to see the patents that Nelson, David and Winthrop Rockefeller were obtaining as far back as the 1970s.</p></p>

        <p>Look up agenda 21. There's a podcast by 'Those Conspiracy Guys' that I listened to recently that gave me a bit of an eye opener. Not sure what this subs view is on the channel itself  but they put in a lot of research
I'm sure theres also plenty of other resources for agenda 21</p>

        <p><strong>”PRESIDENT COOLIDGE UNSWAYED BY MEDICAL PRESSURE</strong></p>
<p>We need strong, intelligent leaders. Where are they now when we need them? <strong>President Coolidge set a good example. When the Jones-Parker Bill and the Randall Bill (bills to set up a medical dictatorship within the government</strong>, raising the head potentate to the official status and salary of the Surgeon General of the Army) were rushed through Congress in 1928, and were brought before President Calvin Coolidge, <strong>he was unmoved by the high pressure medical lobbying.</strong> He looked at the bills and stopped them with a Presidential veto. He gave as his reason for this action: ^1</p>
<p><strong>”These bills give a military status to men supposed to be engaged in scientific research."</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>plot of</strong> medical establishments to set up a <strong>medical dictatorship in U.S. goes way back to the Founding Fathers when they were framing the U.S. Constitution.</strong> There were quite a number of medical doctors in Congress at that time trying to <strong>high pressure a constitutional decree to set up a medical dictatorship.</strong> But the wise opposition won. Dr. Benjamin Rush and Dr. Josiah Bartlett were the opposing forces. They convinced Congress that <strong>one branch of healing in control would be as bad as one religious sect dominating all the others.</strong> That’s exactly what we were fighting against.</p>
<p>George Washington was also a strong President. Even that long ago in 1775 he knew more than our present day doctors do about the harmful effects of vaccination. He issued an order that no man in the Continental Army was to be inoculated. Any enlisted man or officer who submitted to that blood contaminating practice would be dishonorably discharged. He had seen the devastation of smallpox caused by the practice of arm-to-arm inoculation which was introduced from Europe. Edward Jenner and his cow pox abomination did not begin until 1791--16 years later. <strong>Both methods caused widespread disease, disability and death</strong> until compulsory vaccination was abolished all over the world except in about three backward countries and the U.S. armed services. <strong>These are the places which still have outbreaks of the same diseases they vaccinate against. And the diseases are in the vaccinated.</strong></p>
<p>George Washington had enough problems without a lot of vaccine induced disease. Vaccination and inoculation was practiced by the unenlightened as far back as 1,500 years B.C. (See the chapter on HISTORY OF VACCINATION).</p>
<p>What is wrong with our leaders of today. Are their heads turned by bribes or can’t they tell the difference between false propaganda and facts. They are being paid by us to do some home work and investigate before putting our lives and our money on the line.”</p>
<p>Dr. Emanuel Josephson writes in 1952:</p>
<p><strong>”The use of fear of disease had been one of the first approaches to public goodwill adopted by Rockefeller and he knew it to be effective.</strong> Since then it has become standard and accepted practise among the conspirators, even in radical circles. Thus <strong>the Russian Communists offered as an excuse for the invasion of Rumania, statistics that were designed to show "an appalling prevalence of endemic diseases" in Bessarabia.</strong> The Communists propose, in the words of one commentator, that "if Rumania will not treat the needlessly ill with Communism, Russia will cure them with bombs." ^2</p>

<p>i honestly believe that vaccines are one of the best inventions of humanity. this is not sarcastic.</p>

        <p>ok</p>
<p>the qr code scanning to get to certain places</p>
<p>which is a simplified version of saying that businesses and governmental institutions will be able to check your health status at entrances, </p>
<p>and, if you allow extrapolation, will have enhanced possibilities of tracking your whereabouts as they wish,</p>
<p>and also could(!) thus enforce you to take booster shots in order to keep your new gained qr-code empowered freedoms in order for you to be/stay part of society</p>
<p>is authoritarian or at least a big leap getting us very much closer to that.</p>
<p>do you disagree?</p>
<p>and out of curiosity my favourite question in this context:</p>
<p>what needs to happen in order for you to say "the covid-measures are now going too far! "

        <p>The government has literally been tracking you for a decade already, and whether or not you scan a QR code they will continue to do so at a greater extent than you mentioned. The difference is that the we code will actually help to stop the virus.</p>

        <p>does this argument make sense to you?:</p>
<h2>"i have been smoking all my life, so starting to drink a liter of vodka (or 5 liters of coffe) per day doesnt change anything. on the contrary, it helps to complement the taste of nicotine. "</h2>
<p>meaning:
even though i agree govs and corps are tracking us more than ever via e. g. smartphones, is no excuse to do even more surveillance aka privacy breaching. </p>
<p>also, to stay in your narrative: the qr codes wont stop covid deaths, the vaccines will. </p>

        <p>That's not the same argument at all, the QR codes' effect will be a negligible addition to the amount of surveillance you currently experience, but they will slow the virus as it prevents people who could spread the virus from being in close contact with healthy people, while also encouraging people to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Edit, accidentally pressed post early. To answer your question, it would be if you were not allowed to leave your house for any reason, which has never happened in the UK or any other western country.</p>
