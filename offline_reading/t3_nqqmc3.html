        <p>&rt;People who questioned whether masks or lockdowns really worked were shouted down and denounced as a “death cult,” or better yet, simply silenced with the click of a moderator’s mouse.
I supported masks and distancing, mind you. And having had many, many arguments over them, I know how easy it is to fall into the “experts say” trap. For starters, obviously we should listen to experts, because they know more than we do. Just maybe not so much more that we should treat their pronouncements as having dropped from heaven on stone tablets.</p>
<p>&rt;But the illusion of near-infallibility among experts promised certainty at a time when the world had turned out to be much less predictable than we’d thought. And of course it was an easy way to avoid a nonstop game of whack-a-mole with the amazing series of false memes and “facts” that some conservative skeptics, including Trump, kept generating.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Yet I, for one, expected more out of lockdown and masking policies than we ultimately got, and I wonder how my analysis might have changed if I’d engaged more fully with skeptics.</strong> And as a matter of pure scientific analysis, screaming that anyone with a different opinion has joined a science-hating death cult seems to have been among social media’s most popular and least effective non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p>

<p>Bitch, it was only promoted as hysterical uncertainty because of propagandists like you.</p>

        <p>A little bit surprised by this article, but the Washington Post has been one of the least bad neoliberal news sources about COVID.</p>

        <p>I'm still waiting for my apology after being yelled at this entire year.  After losing my business, losing the savings I've built up over the years, and losing dozens of friends because I spoke the truth and respected the scientific method of examining every hypothesis instead of blindly following the decrees of the "Science Cult"®.</p>
<p>After literally accepting piles of vicious abuse for an entire year and counting, I for one, would like an apology.</p>
<p>I doubt we'll ever get it.</p>
