        <p>Can you link some of these studies?  I've yet to see one that "proves" hydroxychloroquine is effective at treating Covid19.  </p>
<p>In fact the FDA revoked the EUA for hydroxychloroquine after a large randomized clinical trial showed it to be ineffective at treating Covid while also <em>increasing</em> the death rate in Covid patients.  </p>
<p>I'd also like to add that hydroxychloroquine can cause heart problems such as ventricular trachycardia and fibrillation, kidney and liver issues.</p>

        <p>Do you not know how to follow the link in the OP?</p>
<p>How it works:</p>
<p>We have known since 2005 that Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1232869/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app</p>
<p>Chloroquine works by opening up the pathway to allow in more Zinc. </p>

<p>Chloroquine Is a Zinc Ionophore. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0109180</p>

<p>Leaked conversation of Lancet and NEJM Editors-In-Chief reveals they already know Big Pharma is a “criminal” cartel pushing rigged science for profit</p>
<p>http://archive.is/6gdy1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app</p>
<p>French audio with English subtitles — Richard Horton, the Editor-In-Chief of The Lancet, says:
“Now we are not going to be able to, basically, if this continues, publish any more clinical research data because the pharmaceutical companies are so financially powerful today, and are able to use such methodologies, as to have us accept papers which are apparently methodologically perfect, but which, in reality, manage to conclude what they want them to conclude.”</p>
<p>--Paraphrased, this means Big Pharma can rig any data necessary to achieve publication of junk science in the journals.

<p>“The U.S. is an international outlier on HCQ,” the paper says. “Right now, doctors around the world are prescribing HCQ to treat COVID-19 outside of hospitals, as well as prophylactically to prevent infection among healthcare workers and vulnerable populations. This paper argues that HCQ has met the appropriate burden of proof and urges members of the U.S. news media, public health community, and regulatory agencies to stop politicizing the use of this medicine. Tens of thousands of lives still hang in the balance.”

        <p>Because they did not prescribe Zinc supplementation with HCQ. It is known that with HCQ and analogues, you HAVE to prescribe Zinc with it or else it is like a 'gun without bullets'... it won't harm the disease you are trying to treat even in the best case scenario.</p>
