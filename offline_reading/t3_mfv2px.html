    <strong>Scary realization</strong>
    <p><p>Its scary that a great amount of people don’t like this sub. Scratch that, staunchly hate us. Every other day on my feed I’m finding more and more subs that are literally going crazy. They feed off the energy of being on the side of authoritarianism. Then again they were always the kind of people to want to, just needed a cause. Between the wrong numbers justified and the cringeworthy rationalizations we are literally well on our way to vaccine passports and subsequent social credit system. No one seems to realize this. Im convinced they just like wearing the masks. Isn’t it funny how the masks don’t work but at the same time they work perfectly. Most people can disagree about a topic and walk away, not these people. </p>
<p>Soon they’re going to change the word Disagree to Disobey.</p></p>

        <p>&rt; No one seems to realize this</p>
<p>They realize just fine. The identity wars of the mid 10s unfolded in a similar way. We'd point out the contradictions, double standards, bigotry and statistical fuckery of grievance studies zealots and they'd answer with more of it. They're on a power trip. They know they're not being intellectually honest, and the fact you still argue as if they are gets them off.</p>

        <p>Honestly this is the first time I've seen this sub, I am someone who will definitely get the vaccine however I respect people's opinions on the matter, if you don't want to get it that's fine as most people will. I think a lot of people on this sub are sick of lockdowns (I live in Ireland we have the longest work lockdown in Europe) and yes I'm sick of them too but I feel as though this anger against lockdowns and the way governments are handling the situation are the problem and are failing people and once the trust in government goes it tends to trickle into distrust for the science community which is a very different kettle of fish.
This is where the more what I would consider 'irrational' theories come from, distrust trickling down. Where you guys would consider my opinion dangerous for humanity, I would consider your opinion dangerous to humanity. Either way whether it's us or you guys I think we can all agree society and the world is a bit fucked and I hope we can come back from it 
 Anyway good health to you all</p>

        <p>So by your definition of science if more people say something to the contrary its the truth and now its back by “science”. Its origins are a different conversation to have although I think its crazy not to think this didn’t come from a lab at this point”</p>

        <p>I think your confusing my definition which is my fault for not being clear so I will elaborate, when I say 'scientists say' what I mean by this is a clinical test designed and run by scientists. So yes if tests are done and 1000 say yes and 5 say no I will go with the results of the 1000 as that is how the scientific method works, and these people have spent their whole lives becoming specialised in their fields.
I think it's best to not go into the origins as I don't believe it was created in a lab and I feel that would be a more circular discussion. But yes your definition is right, science is repeatable, once many people all over the world conduct their independent research and come up with the same answer it is considered correct. Is this to say science knows everything? Of course not as that's the point of science it is to discover things that we don't know through this scientific method. Just look at dark matter and the 'God particle' trying to be isolated in Cern Switzerland, we have barely any idea what the fuck this partical is and what dark matter is. The math checks out but studies are limited because we have never done it before. Taking this train of thought, vaccines have been around for a hell of alot longer. The science behind it has been improving since the 1800s. I agree with you that govornments do some shady shit and should never be fully trusted, but scientists are not the govornment and if almost every scientist in the world says that something is true I believe them because that is how science works.</p>

        <p>I personally just feel if you agree with vaccine passports and the ilk that goes along with it im glad you are not in my country. Im not questioning the science the numbers are numbers they are there. Who I question are the so called “health experts” our government props up in-front of us to misread or frankly lie to the public about the said numbers. The hyper normalization is what I have a problem with.</p>
<p>Edit: also its science it should be able to be questioned. Its not a religion.</p>

        <p>That's fair enough, personally I do think vaccine passports are good short term as I don't want anyone flying into Ireland who could carry the virus, we now have 2 week hotel quarentines for people coming in which I definitely agree with, though once everything calms down they should be ended.
To be fair your govornment is very un-trustable I won't disagree with you there though Biden is definitely a step up from trump.
I think it's the fact that the world locked down and millions of people have still died. The videos from my family in Italy were horrifying when it hit there hard. </p>
<p>And yes your right science should definitely be questioned however when 1000 pieces of evidence say something is right and 5 say that it is wrong you go with the 1000 because that's the scientific method. I am an atheist so religion does not come into the situation for me, though of course I respect people's religions as long as they are not forced on me. I just can't imagine believing this tiny percentage of studies that say corona is fake or made in a lab or not that deadly, against a wealth of studies saying that it is a bad virus and needs to be quelled. I get that you don't trust your govornment but how can you not trust almost every other govornment in the world?</p>
