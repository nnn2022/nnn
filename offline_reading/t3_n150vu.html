    <strong>It’s all going to plan</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve seen a lot of pressure from pro-vaxxers to get the vaccine to “save lives” and “get back to normal”. The truth is, that wasn’t ever gonna happen. The government and health care officials knew that there would be a lot of people who wouldn’t get it. This summer, they will use the fact that nearly half of America remains unvaccinated to tell us that we did not reach herd immunity and we will need to start over again with the vaccinations and continue the masking. The pro-vaxxers will blame us because they believe we could’ve returned to normal if we had just taken the jab. Yet we will rightfully blame the government for their overreach. What we will be left with is a never-ending cash cow for pharmaceuticals, more laws that restrict basic human rights and an even more divided country. My only guess is that people like us will begin to flee to states who are still interested in the sanity of the people, perhaps beginning anew the process of secession. I just don’t see either side moving on this issue.</p></p>

        <p>I am talking to husband about the fact we may have to flee to a freedom state. He doesn't want to leave here. However I said we may have no life here since clubs are already banning me and there's no people here but Covid true believers. [I have the complication of severe autoimmune disease and disabilities] The country is cracking in half. We are progressives to which makes things complicated and scary since the left has gone full into totalitarianism. The Democrat party at this point can kiss my ass.</p>

        <p>It should’ve never been like this. People who want to wear a mask, people who want to take a vaccine, people who want to stay inside, I’ve never had a problem with that. But, as the old adage goes, your right to swing your fist ends at the beginning of my face. Forcing people to wear masks, to stay inside, and perhaps soon, take a vaccine, is the beginning of tyranny. Plain and simple. I suspect law enforcement has been, at least in the US, somewhat complacent in enforcement because they don’t have to. The people have been so entirely turned now that they will perform vigilante justice for them. The more we resist, the louder they will scream in our faces and deny us to live in their society. </p>
<p>So yeah, I see some states turning into social pariah camps. And from what we know about the government is that they will not stop pursuing us until we have bent the knee. I can only suspect that is the reasoning for the big push on disarming the populace right now so we can’t fight back. Then, sanctions and penalties and everything else they can possibly do to make living especially difficult.</p>

        <p>They will tell us exactly that, and we will all just quietly go back to normal.</p>
<p>I'm deep in "enemy" territory (a blue city) and even here, people are barely ever giving me a second look for not wearing a mask, let alone hassling me any more. And every time I go out I see more people's actual faces.</p>
<p>I was in a very fascist store the other day in a clear face shield, which I had to wear to get past the door guard, and everyone stood about a foot or 2 from me, like normal times. Several people spoke to me, smiled at me, and acted completely normal even though they saw my OMG NaKeD FaCe!!</p>
<p>People are done with this bs. They're looking at the free states, *noticing the lack of bodies stacked in the streets in those free states, and deciding to go back to living their lives.</p>

        <p>Have no illusions, I don’t want a civil war nor do I want the US to break apart. I welcome hopeful points of view like yours that we can get past this as a whole country. I may be doomsdaying a bit with my post, granted, as I am unsure how much pressure Americans such as myself can take before we feel we have no choice but to run. What I do think is for certain though is that the lack of vaccinations will lead to more mandates and a renewed vigor for the second attempt at nationwide vaccination. And I don’t think I’m alone in that line of thinking. I am just unsure of the aftermath, rather, the people’s response when that does occur.</p>

        <p>Idk. Around here they just repealed the masks outdoors thing and we are only 1/3 fully vaccinated. I’m sure the CDC changing it helped but I don’t see how they can go back now that people are getting the vaccine</p>
