    <strong>So brand new super scary variant found in South Africa</strong>
    <p><p>Here we go. They've stopped flights from SA and they're trying to ramp up the fear porn to what it was back in March '19. Are people going to buy this shit again? 'Cause I swear if they do they are beyond retarded and we are simply doomed as a species. If they're able to lockdown Europe in 2021 the same way they did in 2020 the face of our economy will be entirely transformed by 2022. There will be nothing left apart from major corporations that were capable of weathering the storm. The face of humanity will have completely changed, too, with how goddamn long they'd have been socially engineering us to isolate, wear masks, limit contact with others and basically remove all joys from our lives that aren't digital. This simply cannot be allowed to happen. If there isn't a mass revolt in 2021 for these measures I don't know what is going to become of us.</p></p>

        <p>Crazy how when everyone in the world was celebrating a light at the end of the tunnel (vaccine) this crops up. They are saying its less lethal now but thats exactly how they described the OG strain back in Jan-early March</p>
<p>Also just read they found a new one in Nigeria as well.</p>

        <p>Crazy that people are falling for this shit and allowing the exact same playbook to be run on them again and again. Juuuuuust when the vaccine finally came out and promised an end. </p>
<p>Imagine being that dense.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's going to go the same way as the first one did. When it happened back in March, a lot of people were reasonably concerned since we had no idea what to expect. Now it's been almost a year later, a year of social media censorship, media fear porn, government incompetence and outright malice, destruction of thousands of small businesses, and some very obvious double standards (BLM can riot but you can't open your store). Even the ones who are still believing the dangers were hedging their bets on the vaccine - and now apparently they're being told that the vaccine doesn't actually do anything. </p>
<p>So yeah, they can try, but I don't think it will work. Good luck getting people in the same mental state they were in before.</p>

        <p>The did here in the UK first and now we can't cross our own internal borders to visit family for Christmas. I think mutations will replace long covid as the new fearmongering trend. Luckily it's also a super easy argument to refute since mutations are common and more contagious almost always = less deadly.</p>
