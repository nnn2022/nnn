        <p>Q1130 <strong>Chair</strong>: Okay. We have talked a lot so far about things that went wrong,
but I think we should spend some time on the big thing that went right:
the vaccine programme. Three colleagues want to ask you about that,
but let me open by asking: what is it that you think we got right on the
vaccine that was so different from some of the other things we have been
talking about today?</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Cummings</strong>: I think, fundamentally, on vaccines, there was clear
responsibility. There was someone who was actually in charge of it—Kate
Bingham. She was working with Patrick Vallance; she built a team of
people who understood what they were doing. She had the strength of
character not to be pushed around.
We had a kind of formal thing which was, “You’re in charge of it. You
report basically directly to the PM. You don’t report to the Department of
Health.” So she knew who her boss was on it. She built a great team, and we also said to her, “Treat this like a wartime thing. Ignore rules. If
lawyers get in your way, come to us and we’ll find ways of bulldozing them
out of your way.”
Clear accountability, and people who really understood what they were
doing. Relative to almost everything else in Whitehall, it was extremely
low friction, and there was some great technical help. Those things, when
you put them together, meant that it worked better than pretty much
anything else.
This is not in any sense a comment on Kate, but I think the fact that it
worked out relatively well to the rest of the world, though, should not
blind us to the fact that we only really got that going—I think my first
conversations about the idea of it with anybody were in March. Patrick
Vallance texted me on, roughly, 24 March I think it was—something like
that; I have got the exact date. Like lots of other things, though, there is
no doubt that we could actually have done this faster than we did.
The conventional wisdom was that we were not going to be able to have
any vaccines in 2020. In March, I started getting calls from various people
saying, “These new MRNA vaccines could well smash the conventional
wisdom, and don’t necessarily stick to it.” People like Bill Gates and that
kind of network were saying that.
Essentially, what happened is that there was a network of Bill Gates-type
people who were saying, “Completely re-think the whole paradigm of how
you do this. Build in parallel—here is the science thing; here is the
manufacturing thing; here’s the distribution; here’s the supply; here’s the
logistics; here’s the data.”
The normal thing is that you do those sequentially. What Bill Gates and
people like that said to me and others at No. 10 was, “You need to think of
this much more like some of the classic programmes of the past—the
Manhattan project in world war two or the Apollo programme—and build it
all in parallel. In normal Government accounting terms, that is completely
crazy, because if nothing works out you have spent literally billions
building all these things up, and the end result is nothing—you get zero for
it, it’s all waste.
What Bill Gates and people and Patrick Vallance and his team were saying
was that the actual expected return on this is so high that even if it does
turn out to be all wasted billions, it is still a good gamble in the end. All
the conventional Whitehall accountancy systems for that cannot basically
cope with it, and you have to throw them all down the toilet. That is,
essentially, what we did.
Patrick came to me and said, “I want to do this. We must take it out of the
Department of Health.” Bear in mind that this was the time we were
having all the conversations about PPE, testing, shielding and all the
things we have gone through today already, with all these different things
being wrong. Patrick said, “Take it out of the Department of Health. Will
you support me on that with the PM?” I said, “Absolutely—damn true I will.” I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary and he completely agreed because,
also, he was watching all of these meetings in April about all the problems
the DH had. So weirdly, this was one of the things that actually had
almost no real formal meetings and actually very little discussion. Patrick,
me and the Cabinet Secretary all basically went to the Prime Minister when
he came back from being ill and said, “There’s just no alternative. We’ve
got to do it like this. It’s inconceivable we can leave it in DH. Here’s the
structure,” and the Prime Minister just decided in 90 seconds: “Fine. Do
it.” That was it, and there was basically not really any formal structure.
There was a little bit of whingeing here and there. There was a little bit of
pushback in some quarters, saying, “This is extremely risky. If you don’t
go down the EU approach and that works, and we do it ourselves and it
doesn’t work, you guys are all going to be in a huge political hole.”</p>
