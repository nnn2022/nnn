    <strong>FDA Approval, or "How I learned to stop worrying about the jab"</strong>
    <p><p>FDA approval is imminent for Pfizer's jab. You know it, I know it, they know it. The odds of it happening are high, but not as high as one might think. The thing about FDA approval is what it opens up legally, and I don't just mean in the realm of new laws or enforcement of laws by the state. Instead, it opens the consumer up to many forms of compensation.</p>
<p>Upon FDA approval, vaccine companies may never become liable like we want, but insurance companies will be forced to pay for the treatments of side-effects for the no-longer experimental vaccine. Insurance companies, who hold the biggest and loudest lobbyists against the medical system. Imagine them being forced to parse through claim after claim after claim of compensation for side effects from a vaccine. Yeah, I got a little smile too.</p>
<p>So functionally, what does this mean? It means approval may not actually come, because no insurance agency is going to want to have to deal with that. They may push back against approval if only so they don't have to pay out, and even they don't push back, they're on the line for all that dosh. This does, however, mean that upon rejection, all of those people hospitalized from side-effects will then be personally responsible for their medical treatment, as none of the vaccine manufacturers can be held liable. Either way, there is a positive to this nonsense. Either the vaccine fails, or Insurance companies get fucked. And either is a win, even if they both incur losses.</p>
<p>So let's stop worrying. Make the truth known instead. You want to push hard against Pfizer? Make sure poeple know they can get paid out in other ways.</p></p>

        <p>Licensing these vaccines would require the state to formally rescind their "propaganda". Simply put, their insistence they could reach herd immunity and the vaccine would prevent infection... (<em>despite the developers being up front, saying that it wouldn't do that</em>). </p>
<p>In short, licensing would require the government to back off the "need" to get vaccinated. As such -- I don't suspect they're in any hurry to send out the approval -- at least until they can't keep that narrative going.</p>
<p>Depending on how the side effects play out, the vaccine will get approval for diminishing the severity of COVID-19. But not as an immunization. (It never was going to get that). Barring that immunization status, the teeth really falls off any of these mandates.</p>

        <p>Hmm. Could this be the answer the the puzzling question as to why places are starting to ramp up the whole vax passport for regular life thing just as it‚Äôs starting to really get out there that these things don‚Äôt work so well?</p>

        <p>Pfizer is definitely getting approved.  Bought calls on their stock, hoping to at least profit off this miserable bullshit.</p>

        <p>This is the sickest fucking thing of the current situation.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs suspend reality and imagine these vaccines actually provide the protection from Covid that is claimed.</p>
<p>1) Your employer makes vaccination mandatory</p>
<p>2) You get vaccine and have debilitating side effect leaving you disabled</p>
<p>3) Many insurance companies will not cover your expenses at all or if you are lucky only limited amounts</p>
<p>4) Your employer who mandated the vaccine is under no obligation to file a worker‚Äôs compensation claim on your behalf</p>
<p>5) Your employer is under no legal liability to you because you ‚Äúvoluntarily‚Äù took the vaccine; you can sue them but you are looking at a decade before you‚Äôd see any money and that‚Äôs if you win which isn‚Äôt guaranteed</p>
<p>6) You don‚Äôt even have access to the US‚Äôs shitty ‚Äúvaccine court‚Äù that‚Äôs been set up for other vaccines because these are exempted; even if you were; the burden is on you to prove the vaccine caused your injuries which may be impossible considering your health status pre-vaccination (pre-existing condition, smoker etc.)</p>
<p>6) Of course you can‚Äôt sue the manufacturers</p>
<p>It‚Äôs another example of crony capitalism in which the corporations get all the financial rewards and the citizens get all the risk.</p>
