    <strong>I'm going to post this again, it will help everyone trying to share info. I think my post somehow got sorted out</strong>
    <p><p>Here's what I posted last night:</p>
<p>I am trying to upload small video files that can be viewed directly if posted on here, but doing batch uploads just doesn't seem to work anywhere!</p>
<p>I tried Streamable. 9 videos uploaded, then blocked regardless of device change, VPN, clearing cookies etc. Could not add more, it uploaded but as soon as it went to processing, it shows an exclamation symbol and no further info.</p>
<p>My guess is since the upload worked at first until processing, they use it to identify the file by hashing it using CRC or MD5 to see if the file has been attempted before.</p>
<p>Went to Google Drive. All videos uploaded, could not be processed.</p>
<p>Went to Catbox, most files uploaded but were broken or not processed.</p>
<p>Went to mega, all files uploaded but no built in preview/video player. Have to download.</p>
<p>Is there any good alternative? Sorry if I sound frustrated but I am, have been working all night trying to share these in one batch, so the can just be played like any other video in browser.</p></p>
