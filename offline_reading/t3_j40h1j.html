        <p>"hopes it might be a covid denier colony?"</p>
<p>You know that denying is not happening here. Pretending we do to keep up your " i am smart and educated" charade makes my body literally cringe of awkwardness. </p>
<p>We are bagatellizing covid19 here because most of us do not consider it very important, or grave enough to justify the measures, attention and all the moral accusations people have to deal with.</p>
<p>I am not a covid denier. Otherwise I would not joke about it as much.</p>
<p>I personally think covid is hilarious and people here in the Netherlands mostly pretend to care. Loads of people are not ready yet to joke about the apocalyptic virus that turned out to be a nasty version of the flu. Mainly old people with one leg in the grave dying of it.</p>
<p>I had covid and it was a joke. Mild cough and over it was. All the people yelling about long term damage?</p>
<p>Probably very fat and neglecting their health to a great extent.</p>
<p>Nobody I know, nobody had anything worse than a flu. In my parents age group 60 nobody had any problems.</p>
<p>But that is because here in the Netherlands we exercise and live healthy and do not binge on fastfood as much.</p>
<p>"Lets be logica- oh nvm"</p>
<p>Cringe again. But you are right that it would be odd to search for "nonewnormal". </p>
<p>I personally think you saw an antimask comment, antilockdown comment etc and followed someone's profile down here.</p>

        <p>The data certainly doesn't support this ridiculous statement. People have been socially distancing and wearing masks for months, and the virus keeps spreading regardless. Some of the most locked down places on the planet have not had any success whatsoever at containing this disease. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Your strange devotion and faith to masks are absolutely irrational and illogical. Its not supported by the science or the data. But you keep doing your rain dance.</p>

        <p>Ah New Zealand. So a tiny, sparsely populated island nation that has completely blocked all all international travel and locked its citizens down for 6 months is your counter example? You attribute their "success" to masks. C'mon. </p>
<p>There are studies on both sides of the issue. Here are a few:</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19216002/</p>
<p>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x</p>
<p>https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747</p>
<p>But in the end they are all limited studies. The real world data trumps the studies. And the teal world data is very clear that masks have no measurable impact on the spread of this virus.</p>

        <p>No, the research doesn't say that. The research is the actual data from the places where masks have been mandated. Why you think a peer reviewed limited study about masks is superior to the actual results from real world mask usage is utterly bizarre. The numbers speak for themselves, and almost without exception, masks have not helped prevent the spread of covid. If your theory is not supported by the data, your theory is wrong.</p>

        <p>Here are a bunch of examples. They don't do peer review of just reporting the raw data. I get that you have gone all in on masks. I get that you desperately want masks to be the savior that you have been told that they are. I get that faith masks are part of your religion now. Just know that at some point you will realize you have been manipulated and misled. You are neck deep in it, and so devoted to the cause that you are doing missionary work on reddit trying to bring new converts to the fold, so I don't expect you to waver in your faith, but every day it becomes so much more obvious to anyone actually trying to know the truth that masks are no different from a rain dance. </p>

        <p>Nope, it's the actual data showing it. It's no surprise you will ignore the real data, I definitely expected that. Accepting the actual numbers and facts would destroy your entire worldview, so it makes sense that you would rather blindly reject the truth. But just know your entire religion is built upon fear, lies and ignorance.</p>

        <p>You might want to check out a cute little study Oxford did, looking into these so called “studies”. They found that most of them had thrown the scientific method out the window in order to get an intended result. Most of them aren’t scientifically sound at all and can’t be labeled studies whatsoever. </p>
<p>There are plenty of studies that were done before covid and this narrative were ever a thing that focused on masks and the transmission of the flu, also a respiratory virus not too dissimilar to covid.  They found overwhelmingly that anything short of a fitted N95 did absolutely nothing, and many found they increased chances of transmission. While I understand the flu and covid aren’t exactly the same (because you guys seem to love to remind everyone of that), they are both highly contagious respiratory viruses that can spread through the air. And on top of that, people do have more immunity built up to the flu. So even with this immunity masks didn’t help decrease transmission, how the hell are they helping decrease it with covid, which most people have yet to build resistance to? Covid is a highly effective virus, it kills few and spreads easy, your little piece of fabric with gaps all over being worn improperly for the most part is doing jack shit. </p>
<p>Before you ask me to pull these studies, it’s a Friday night and I’m going out with friends to try and enjoy the semblance of a life I have left, they’re easy to find on pubmed and google scholar with a simple search.</p>

        <p>The issue is a virus that the population hasn't been exposed to and has no immunity for. Sure, we can slow it down by distancing for a month. But after a month, we're in the same boat. At some point, you've got to realize that germs exist and get on with your life.</p>

        <p>We get new flu vaccines each year because we're constantly dealing with new strains. We occasionally predict incorrectly and get through unvaccinated. This is nothing new.</p>
<p>The definition of a pandemic has nothing to do with the deadliness, it's only about spread. A pandemic is an epidemic that's in multiple countries. A flu fits the classic definition of a pandemic. I don't know how other countries' current status should impact our domestic policies.</p>

        <p>There are certainly commonalities as well as differences. I'm asking for the criteria that would necessitate any of these measures. Given that you expect a different response to the two, I assume that the criteria for this response lies not in the commonalities, but in the differences. What you've given me only included common aspects (epidemic in multiple countries, strain without a vaccine), until you named the number of deaths. So I'm asking for clarification. At what number of deaths did it become unacceptable?</p>

        <p>There is no need to NOT catch it. Most of the people who die from COVID are already dying from some other cause. If you're not old, obese, or chronically/terminally ill, you'll probably be fine. If you're any of those things, you're already NOT fine with or without COVID.</p>

<p>&rt;The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high</p>

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Of the nine trials of facemasks identified in community settings, in all but one, facemasks were used for respiratory protection of well people. They found that facemasks and facemasks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection in community settings, subject to early use and compliance.

A recently reported randomized trial showed a significant benefit of both hand hygiene and face masks (worn by the index case and contacts) in preventing influenza transmission in households

        <p>Smallpox was eradicated through vaccination over several decades, with a vaccine that was well-researched, well-tested, and reasonably safe. Forcing people without smallpox to cover their faces constantly wasn't part of it, nor was forcing healthy people to stay away from each other and not get to touch or whisper to another person for months or longer. Smallpox also was much, much more dangerous than COVID or seasonal flu.</p>

        <p>Does it depress you to know how many people die from cancer, heart disease, or suicide each year? If not why is COVID so special?</p>
<p>Sure masks reduce spread. But how long do you want these precautions? Cases are still going to go up no matter what until you reach a level of immunity. I’d much prefer the Florida approach than CA who will be in lockdown at least another 6 to 18 months.</p>

        <p>This depresses you so:</p>
<p>you were fine before with global famine because people do not donate pocket change to save a child?</p>
<p>Mostly old people dying of something that can be considered natural causes, which could be slightly diminished by a dystopian society where bare faces are taboo is your nightmare?</p>
<p>This is what manages to depress you? To take action? To scold us here for not wearing masks? To blame us for your depression? </p>
<p>Your worldview is even more alien to me than you think. </p>
<p>What depresses me is that you were fine before with all the global devastation and famine. Only now something depresses you and it is not even that disturbing.</p>
<p>These virus deaths normally not a single person would ever give a fuck, same with flu.</p>
<p>Only when the media tells you to emphatize: you do it and on command.</p>
<p>I am depressed by people who joyously whistle through the world where children get prostituted and killed in wars and those people do not care at all. They never feel any empathy or responsibility.</p>
<p>You want to know why?</p>
<p>Because the media does not persuade and implore them to care.</p>
<p>But when a mediocre virus arrives suddenly these same people feel the need to visit obscure reddit subs to scold people for opposing mandatory masking.</p>
<p>For what? For any possible marginal benefit you will come here and scold people?</p>
<p>All this while the lockdowns have destroyed progress in reducing global poverty and child famine.</p>
<p>People like you and I am sorry to offend:</p>
<p>Depress the living fuck out of me with your selective empathy combined with moral claims.</p>
<p>Children dying of famine in africa, getting prostituted in india. </p>
<p>No all the attention should go to the 80 year olds that face a significant viral threat. All the effort should go to yelling about masks while perpetuating economy damaging measures that wreck the same mentioned children that nobody of the "morally sound" people would ever care about enough to be depressed about, let alone saddened.</p>
<p>Did you ever care so much about any other issue so much that it depressed you to the extent you would look for specific reddits and scold those people with moral arguments:</p>
<p>Blame them for your depression?</p>

        <p>Old people are going to die of something. We are not talking about people in their prime snatched away from life.</p>
<p>You fail to account for which people we "kill" with our opposition to masks.</p>
<p>First we do not kill because this is not a binary thing. Everybody masking won't suddenly save everyone. Every freedom has a cost in life.</p>
<p>I don't call you a killer for driving your car eventhough everyone driving will inevitably kill people. </p>
<p>The link with driving is quite direct. But with coronavirus you are not getting whacked by a car. A car victim is not necessarily an 80 year old with two comorbidities that belongs to the 0.2% or less that won't survive this virus.</p>
<p>These people could have taken measures themselves, stayed home, often they could have eaten healthier, stopped smoking, exercised more. But in this causality chain you blame us for not wanting to cover our face to potentially minimally diminish a risk of spreading a disease 99.8% survive.</p>
<p>"But they are old!" </p>
<p>Old people die of the flu too. Old people are supposed to die of something at some point that is how this life unfortunately works. Most of the people that die of coronavirus live with one leg in the grave.</p>
<p>If you do not want to argue by putting so little effort in this pathetic drunk driving example, you might as well try your luck elsewhere.</p>
<p>You are not going to convince me without actually refuting my previous points.</p>
<p>You come here expecting that we here are just people not aware of what we are doing or causing.</p>
<p>You would be wrong as everyone here sees hypocrites daily and are expected to defend themselves against murdering charges for not covering up their face to curb the spread of something not that different from the flu in terms of survivability.</p>
<p>I can look at myself in the mirror. I know who I am. I am not someone that watches the hysteria induced mainstream news and feels justified in using his or her alleged mental health issues to scold some people online for wanting to live a normal life.</p>

        <p>Maybe you should come to terms with the harvesting effect as well. A drunk driver splattering your mother over the pavement isn't a very good comparison to an unmasked individual infecting your mother - or infecting someone who infects someone who infects your mother - with a virus that primarily kills those who are already dying anyway. If your mother isn't already dying from chronic/terminal illness or simply old age, she'll probably survive with no lasting complications, or perhaps some complications comparable to any other cold or flu. If your mother is already dying....well, she'd probably die soon anyway, with or without COVID. That's the harvesting effect. Sorry, wearing a mask won't cure your mother's AIDS or make her young again.</p>

        <p>Except most people who die from COVID are already near death from some other cause such as old age, obesity, HIV, COPD, diabetes, or - yes - cancer. See I'm not comparing COVID to cancer, the point is, <em>comorbidities</em> and <em>harvesting effect</em>. While COVID may be preventable to some degree, those deaths are not, as most of the people who would die from COVID would die from the flu, pneumococcal pneumonia, a heart attack, etc within the next few months or maybe years. Tragic, but no more tragic than disrupting the lives of young healthy people with mask mandates, social distancing, stay-at-home orders, business shutdowns, contact tracing, or supervised quarantines in the hopes of squeezing a few more years out of those who would have little time left with or without COVID. Many of those at-risk individuals don't even want protected, as many of them either know their own risk tolerance and have come to terms with their mortality OR they've been taking precautions to protect themselves from infectious disease since before COVID.

<p>We do not kill 70 year olds with coronavirus. </p>
<p>They die because they get it (which they can prevent by wearing a  n95) and otherwise they would have died from something else because even in the 70's people have multiple comorbidities.</p>

        <p>Lmao. They did not stop it. Either way if anything remotely similar to that was the case, they’re an isolated island so it’s kind of expected that cases will drop there. You can’t expect the same of the rest of the damn world and in fact NZ’s strict measures will greatly harm their economy in the long-run since they rely on tourism</p>

        <p>Ahh yes the all important economy. If the United States was as effective at controlling the spread of Covid as New Zealand, 1650 people would have died instead of 200,000. I’d accept great economic harm if it saved 200,000 lives</p>

        <p>All things considered, how is the “United States” supposed to control the actions and movements of 300 million people? What does that even mean? Do you really expect 300+ million people to adhere to all the rules the same? Do you expect essential workers to not go into work and run the country, in conditions where social distancing isn’t viable, and stay at home? New Zealand has a population of 4 million people and relies on the government for free health care, cheap/free education, and other provisions that we unfortunately do not have here in the US. A functioning social safety net. Of course the citizens of NZ are going to adhere to covid restrictions more; they trust the government because the government gives them extensive social benefits. You simply can’t expect the same of the citizens of the majority of the US. </p>
<p>We live in a democracy, not a nanny state. If you don’t like it here, quit whining and leave.</p>

        <p>Compared to someone in their 20s, people in their 70s ARE at death's door. When a person in their 70s dies, fewer years of life are lost than if someone in their 20s dies, nevermind the average difference in quality of life. People like you wanna talk facts, numbers, science? Your arguments are no less emotionally driven than ours. Your precious science says older people are vastly more likely to die or experience lasting complications from COVID, AND those older people are closer to death's door than a younger healthier person whether COVID is in thee picture or not. Whether those deaths "matter" any more or less is a moral judgement. An emotional plea. Science uncovers the facts, it doesn't tell us how to feel about it.</p>
<p>Nevermind that I did not say the deaths of older people "don't matter" or are "completely acceptable", I simply said that the death of an older person results in less years of life lost than the death of a younger person. And nevermind that passively spreading a virus with a largely age-dependent mortality rate isn't "killing someone" on the same level as actively striking them down with a motor vehicle. To say the death of every individual is equivalent regardless of age is histrionic talk.</p>

No N95s but plenty of KN95s, and guess what? They are pretty equal in what they do:</p>
<p>N95s and KN95s are both rated to capture 95% of particles. Among the minor differences, only KN95 masks are required to pass fit tests, while N95 masks have slightly stronger breathability standards.</p>

        <p>But what’s your stance on the flu? It’s been around forever. Did you mask up every flu season? If not then apparently you weren’t depressed by the number of people dying from the flu, which includes young people whereas corona typically does not. And what about RSV and Parainfluenza? These can lead to pneumonia and death. </p>
<p>So what changed? Seriously asking:</p>
<p>What made you get depressed about corona deaths? Especially since we now know the death rate is only about 1%.</p>
