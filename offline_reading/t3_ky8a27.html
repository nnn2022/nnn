    <strong>This stuff is available right on Wikipedia. And yet the sheep trust this rushed vaccine???</strong>
    <p><p>As they said on the X-Files, "The truth is out there". It isn't hard to find. How can anyone have faith in the processes governments and Big Pharma used to create a Wuhan Flu vaccine in less than a year, when you read this:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">Human Guinea Pigs</a></p>
<p>Just a few excerpts...</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1941, at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology">virologists</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Francis,_Jr.">Thomas Francis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Salk">Jonas Salk</a> and other researchers deliberately infected patients at several Michigan mental institutions with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza">influenza</a> virus by spraying the virus into their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose">nasal</a> passages </li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea-Spray">Let's spray bacteria over the city of San Francisco, and when people get sick, cover it up!</a></li>
<li>In 1963, 22 elderly patients at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jewish_Chronic_Disease_Hospital&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>,  New York were injected with live cancer cells by Chester M. Southam,  who in 1952 had done the same to prisoners at the Ohio State Prison, in  order to "discover the secret of how healthy bodies fight the invasion  of malignant cells". The administration of the hospital attempted to  cover the study up, but the New York medical licensing board ultimately  placed Southam on probation for one year. Two years later, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society">American Cancer Society</a> elected him as their vice president.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-textbook-research-ethics-26-29-54">[54]</a> </li>
<li>In 2004, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a> research participant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Dan_Markingson">Dan Markingson committed suicide</a> while enrolled in an industry-sponsored pharmaceutical trial comparing three FDA-approved atypical antipsychotics: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetiapine">Seroquel (quetiapine)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olanzapine">Zyprexa (olanzapine)</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risperidone">Risperdal (risperidone)</a>.  Writing on the circumstances surrounding Markingson's death in the  study, which was designed and funded by Seroquel manufacturer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca">AstraZeneca</a>, University of Minnesota Professor of Bioethics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Elliott_(philosopher)">Carl Elliott</a>  noted that Markingson was enrolled in the study against the wishes of  his mother, Mary Weiss, and that he was forced to choose between  enrolling in the study or being involuntarily committed to a state  mental institution.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-167">[167]</a>  Further investigation revealed financial ties to AstraZeneca by  Markingson's psychiatrist, Dr. Stephen C. Olson, oversights and biases  in AstraZeneca's trial design, and the inadequacy of university <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_review_board">Institutional Review Board (IRB)</a> protections for research subjects.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-168">[168]</a> A 2005 FDA investigation cleared the university. Nonetheless, controversy around the case has continued. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Jones_(magazine)"><em>Mother Jones</em></a> article<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-169">[169]</a>  resulted in a group of university faculty members sending a public  letter to the university Board of Regents urging an external  investigation into Markingson's death.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#cite_note-170">[170]</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Look at the names involved. Look at the companies involved. I'm sure they will sound familiar to you. And if you browse, there is example after example of this stuff.</p>
<p>The intellectually lazy and the naive, who are waiting to line up for this vaccine, are going to be the Wikipedia entries of tomorrow.</p></p>

        <p>Does it matter anymore? They are mandating vaccines at work places (UK, US) and opening detention  camps for people breaking covid rules (DE) which I'm sure they will use for unvaccinated people too, people get beaten up and arrested in AU and CA... We are heading towards something so evil and twisted and yet people have been so brainwashed already they are fucking clapping for the idea to be enslaved.
Sorry for the negative vibe but yesterday it was bank accounts and jobs, today it is camps.</p>

        <p>It always matters. We can't give up.</p>
<p>It isn't over until the Cellulite-Enhanced Cis-Woman sings.</p>
<p>One ray of hope is the massive number of health care workers who are refusing the vaccine, all over the western world. There are freely-available articles quoting figures like 30%, 50%, and up to 60% depending on country and facility.</p>
<p>If doctors, nurses, and health care aides won't take it, that might actually give some people pause. Imagine if the CEO of BMW refused to drive one of his own vehicles and owned a Ford - it's the same idea.</p>
<p>We can't just walk away and concede the field to the tyrants.</p>

        <p>&rt; It always matters. We can't give up.</p>
<p>Except nothing we've done or said has made any difference. This stuff is already being set in motion. There's going to be massive death, destruction, and suffering coming soon. </p>
<p>Before you or someone else from here chimes in, yes, "nothing last forever, this shall pass". Sure. But that doesn't negate the death, destruction, and suffering that will occur, and much of it can still go on for weeks, months, years, decades. If your child (or any loved one, really) were to get brain damage from one of the mandated vaccines or sent to a detention camp where they die, will you still be singing this same tune? I don't see this getting better anytime soon, it's getting worse.</p>

        <p>It takes more courage to face a battle knowing that it will be costly and you (or those you love, for that matter) may perish, than to simply go to ground and give up.</p>
<p>History is full of examples of causes that appeared lost, but prevailed in the end. I would rather be a Winston Churchill than a Marshal Petain.</p>
<p>If we fail, life won't be worth living, anyway. Why prolong the agony?</p>
