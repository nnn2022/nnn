    <strong>In the interest of returning to normal</strong>
    <p><p>I see a lot of people concerned, fearful, and mostly just outright against getting the COVID vaccine, and for some reasons I can relate. </p>
<p>I remember when they first started researching a vaccine, and I was sure it would take years. Lo and behold, here we are with this new type of vaccine, and we are told this is the key to returning to normal. Here is where I understand the resistance, especially given the issues with the JJ and Astra Zeneca vaccine.  This vaccine seems rushed and an unnecessary risk to my health so why should I get it?</p>
<p>But here lies the key. I got my first dose of Pfizer last week, and I was nervous, but I did not get it for myself. I am a healthy 25M, so even if I got Covid I doubt I would struggle with it. But the reasons I got it are three fold. </p>
<ol>
<li>I’m a medic</li>
</ol>
<p>I was a medic in the Air Force before starting college, and now I’m set to start a doctorate program in the fall. I will be studying and working in a hospital for the next four years before I graduate, and as a medic it is my responsibility to do what I must to ensure I don’t get my patients sick, and they don’t get me sick. Therefore my first reason is an ethical and occupational one, but it also is why I am willing to trust the vaccine. I’ve worked with MDs and PhDs in all fields of science and medicine, and I know they are extremely intelligent and hard working people. I don’t know the science they used to make this vaccine, but they are the educated ones and until I am at their level all I can logically do is trust their work as professionals.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are members of my family who are vulnerable to COVID</li>
</ol>
<p>This is one I think most of us deal with even though we may not want the vaccine. My Grandma is in her 80’s and struggles enough with her health as it is, how dare I risk her health by refusing a vaccine that can make it less likely I get her sick? I haven’t visited her in over a year because of this COVID bullshit, and not long after I get my second dose you bet your ass I’m driving down to hang out with her. </p>
<ol>
<li>Returning to normal</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the kicker guys. We all want to not be forced to wear masks, go drinking in bars with buddies, have large family gatherings, get back to in person class, and do all these things without masks, but case numbers and vaccine rates have to improve before we get there. Not all of us have to get it, if you’re a hold out be a hold out I don’t blame you one bit. But enough of us have to get it and the rest of us just need to not get COVID for a bit and we’ll finally be back to normal. In the interest of returning to normal, I’m getting my vaccine because in the big picture that is the first I can do to help.</p>
<p>Sorry for the essay, just thought I’d share my two cents. Like I said, I don’t blame any of you for your concerns and fears, so if you disagree that’s fine. Whatever your thoughts and situations, stay strong out there</p>
<p>EDIT: grammar corrections</p></p>

        <p>Most of us doubt things will return to normal even if we get the vaccine, and then, because of this precedence, anytime there’s any silly outbreak the world will shut down again until there’s a vaccine. Some of my family and friends live overseas and i know I’m not the only one. Restricting travel like that is inhumane and should NEVER be done again. It reeks of West Berlin and North Korea 😠.</p>

        <p>I totally understand, but also remember the us didn’t lock their borders first, other countries did  and then we followed suit to avoid a traveling virus. I agree with you, I can’t wait to be able to travel again as well. But also, I mean if things are never going to return to normal we are screwed anyway, so why not at least try?</p>

        <p>I'm sure if someone was holding a loved one hostage, you'd give them whatever they wanted for even the slightest chance the kidnappers would keep their word.  I think we all would.  But wouldn't you also fight like a wild beast to get them back any way possible?  I know I would</p>
<p>Our normal is being held hostage.  Now, we can pay and hope the kidnappers keep their word, or we can resist and fight to get it back.</p>

        <p>State governments in the US mainly.  They will keep this going unless enough people protest and rebel.
National governments in Canada (and provencial governments), the UK and some European countries.</p>
<p>In the US, businesses are requiring masks and such, but that's only because they think people want that.  They lose enough business and they'll change.</p>
<p>Also, some businesses want to force people to get an expimental vaccine as a condition of employment.   This is ethically wrong and against federal law to boot.  That doesn't stop them from coercing people amd making threats.</p>

        <p>In order to get an expermental agent, a person has to provide informed consent.  If they are threatened with unemployment, then that consent isn't valid because it was obtained under duress.  Therefore, they can't legally receive the expimental agent becaise they can't give consent.</p>
<p>Business can mandate their employees receive FDA approval vaccines.  However, they still habe to provide exemptions under certain conditions.</p>
<p>It isn't about requiring a vaccine as a condition of employment.  It's all about the experimental deaignation amd how that has to be handled to comply with the EUA terms.</p>

        <p>This was another thing I was confused about, these vaccines are not experimental, and they are approved by the FDA for emergency use. The vaccines have been shown that they can reduce the severity and risk of COVID, the only reason they do not have blanket approval is that they have not yet been shown to outright prevent COVID.</p>

        <p>They are approved for the EUA, but have not received an FDA approval as a new agent.  In other words, they haven't been proven safe and effective for prevention of Covid (to any degree) yet.  The consent says this plainly.  They haven't received blanket approval because they haven't went through the entire process.  It could still be approved even if it only lessons the severity.  However, the approved indication wouldn't be listed outright prevention, and it wouldn't be unusual if this happened.</p>
<p>Experimental probably isn't the right word, but most people don't understand what "not fully approved" means.  You're right, they aren't technically experimental because they aren't in phase 3 trials.</p>
<p>Employers have provide reasonable exemptions.  Right now, everyone can use the excuse that they don't have an FDA approval.  Conscientious objection is harder to justify for approved agents like the flu vaccine.</p>

        <p>You had reasons to get the vaccine before it's FDA approved, and that's your decision.  I respect and support it.  What I don't support is how people who are at a very low risk of severe Covid are being pressured to get something experimental.</p>
<p>As for getting back to normal, our freedoms were taken away.  According to the newest data, not only was this unnecessary, the stay at home orders were harmful.  Now, we're being told we need to get an experimental biologic agent so the government will cease these unnecessary and likely harmful practices.</p>
<p>In other words, the government will give us back our rightful freedoms if we do something they want.  Do you know what it's called when someone takes away something of yours and demands you do something for them in order to get it back?</p>
<p>It's called ransoming.  It's what kidnappers and terrorists do.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure what freedoms, protected by the constitution and bill of rights, were taken away by lockdowns, and as for them being harmful for society and the economy I agree with you, but I have to ask what your alternative plan would have been when the pandemic started. </p>
<p>Remember that this was a brand new virus, people were dying, and governments had a responsibility to mitigate the damage. I don’t envy their position at all or the decisions they had to make.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling pressured I’m here to tell you there is no pressure, you don’t have to get it. Like I said I don’t blame you and I understand your frustration, but I’m not going to go so far as to say “my freedoms have been kidnapped and the government is holding them ransom”. I support you man, stay strong and wait until you feel confident in the vaccine</p>

        <p>We did have constituional rights taken away.  Freedom of assembly was revoked.  Freedom of speech was compromised by censorship on social media and news, and the government turned a bljnd eye.</p>
<p>Masks hinder freedom of expression and people's ability to read lips.  Church services were stopped.  So, there goes freedom of religion.  Gun shops were closed in some areas because they were deemed non-esssential.  So, right there we have both the 1st and 2nd amendments violated.</p>
<p>By April 2020 we knew 70% of people had no or mild symptoms.  We knew most of those who died with Covid succumbed to their pre-existing conditions instead of the virus.  We knew in March of 2020 that the virus had been spreading wild since at least January 2020.</p>
<p>I just genuinely hope you nor anyone else has any long term effects from the vaccine.  Thing is we don't know because there's not enough data.  All this so we can get back wjat was rightfully ours all along.</p>

        <p>Wow, you try to come off reasonable, then you spout all this ignorance.</p>
<p>&rt;Freedom of assembly: not revoked, people assemble and protest every day these days.</p>
<p>During the stay at home order people couldn't assemble, and still there's restrictions on gathering.  Remember the police disbursing people in Miami?
Sure there are protests, but that's only if the government decided to allow it.  </p>
<p>&rt;Freedom of speech: not revoked, you just cant openly promote sedition or domestic terrorism.</p>
<p>Don't forget Covid "misinformation".  That got censored.  Don't see the government stopping that.  In fact they enabled it.</p>
<p>&rt;2nd: This amendment does not protect gun shops lol, I still have my guns and shoot regularly, so my right has not been compromised.</p>
<p>Actually it does, lol.  If you make it impossible for people to buy guns, that is de facto infringement.
Your argument about you owning a gun is immaterial.</p>
<p>Hurray!  We exposed another person who really doesn't care about our freedoms.  Another person who wants others to get vaccinated so they can feel superior.  You almost pulled the whole "rational" act off.  Good bye.</p>

        <p>Sorry I seem ignorant, I'm not trying to pull a rational act, just telling you how I view things. But anyway, gun shops are back open now, and stay home orders are lifted, so even if you feel you were robbed of your freedoms that is over. You are free to do what you like, whether you get a vaccine or not.</p>

        <p>But I feel this argument is irrelevant as with every pandemic in recent history society has accepted that in order to stop or reduce the pandemic we get vaccines. Flu, measles, rubella, chicken pox, polio, and I'm sure there is more, why is getting this vaccine for this pandemic so sensitive?</p>

        <p>That doesn’t mean we need to give the government the ability to swab my asshole for covid every chance they get or attempt to force everyone to comply to an experimental vaccine, every other “pandemic” in recent history also had a working vaccine on average around 9 years of development before it was considered safe for human consumption</p>

        <p>Did you just forget that the vaccine manufacturers have said that it wont necessarily prevent transmission? Only symptoms? Likewise I still respect you for coming on here and posting your opinion despite it not really being the opinion in general on this sub. I would encourage you to think about your number two and three a bit more though. For two, look into what manufacturers say the vaccine will do - more of them might be saying now that it reduces transmission, but that would not matter if the person worried about getting sick has the vaccine. There would always be some chance they can get sick, but only if they have the vaccine themselves would symptoms be reduced and hospitalization be less likely. Look at the stats published for age group risk of injury due to virus vs. vaccine. Multiple health agencies have posted information about this. For the elderly, it is around 30:1 (so 30x more likely to get sick from the virus than from the vaccine), but for young people, it is more like 2:1, or 1:1, and a lot of research is left to be done on the vaccines. You have to weigh this risk for yourself.</p>

        <p>Agreed 100%. To be clear, I’m not a member of this sub, just lurking. I’m a graduating undergrad student getting into the medical field and I’ve taken countless microbiology, immunology, and other related coursework. My professors have been working in their fields for decades and they get so frustrated when talking about people refusing vaccines (the greatest public health success there’s ever been). It’s a personal choice but I’d love to see anyone here try to debate them 😂</p>

        <p>I've seen enough about adverse reactions. And I'll trust dr. Micheal Yeadon over paid mouthpieces. There is not enough information out there, and there is a reason that this tech hasnt been used before, its had disastrous outcomes in animal studies. And why would I need to take it if I'm not at risk?</p>

        <p>It doesn’t make sense because the adverse events in the vaccines that y’all refer to are far less likely to occur than the adverse events from COVID infection. You guys talk about only 1% of people dying from COVID but then a post about a 1 in a million reaction to a vaccine confirms your hesitancy?</p>

        <p>The same ‘experts’ that used to use blood letting as a preferred medical method. Or the same ‘experts’ who prescribed thalomide to pregnant women. Or the same ‘experts’ who will willingly prescribe opiates to people regardless of their addictive qualities because the more prescriptions written the bigger the kickback paycheque.</p>

        <p>Most of us have no problem with vaccines in general.  I get the flu shot every year.  I have a problem with these particular vaccines which use new mechanisms of action and aren't fully tested.</p>
<p>They should only be used in the people who are at the highest risk of severe Covid.  The rest of us can wait until they're actually approved by the FDA and the long-term effects have been studied.</p>
<p>Now, if they'd just made a traditional inactivated virus vaccine, then I'd have much less hesitancy.  We know the long-term effects those generally have.</p>

        <p>Now I agree with this, I think the only reason low risk people are being targeted for the vaccine is to reach herd immunity, which I think is a longshot, but we can't force all the vulnerable people to get it so enough others have to get it in order to reduce their risk.</p>
