    <strong>In Noc yourself out!</strong>
    <p><p>Just a random observation.... Ever notice the ones who actually want it always seem to make fun of others unknowingly? Insecure much? They are cringy to be around. When asked about whyyy in your right mind whyyy the overwhelming response has been because "others expect me to". <em>Jaw drops</em> well Inoculate yourself out then! Let me know how that works out for ya!</p></p>

        <p>The most indoctrinated were already before this extremely intolerable people as it was, it's like they don't even have their own mind. They're always mad at everyone who even has the nerve to smile and do anything by their own opinions. Now they're the top new normal nazis, surprising isn't it? with most others the response I get the most to submitting to it is all is what you said. I shouldn't be shocked having been alive for 20 something years now but it's still irritating because if these people weren't like this the whole pandemic would never have been a thing. It's nothing but an enabler of the worst of people.</p>
