    <strong>WARNING to women who haven't been vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>The vaccine is worse than we thought. The vaccine is affecting ALL women regardless of whether they have been vaccinated or not. There have been reports of women having longer and heavier periods, missing or having early periods, and/or other problems with their period, including miscarriages, just from being near people who have been vaccinated even though they themselves haven't been vaccinated. Vaccinated people seen to be shedding and affecting other people around them. We're not sure whether this is also affecting men, so we should assume they are being affected. If you're unvaccinated stay away from anyone who has been vaccinated. Please share this with as many people as you can and upvote to get word out.</p>

        <p>I agree, I’m not going to avoid vaccinated people over this even if it ends up having some effect on me. Some of my best friends are and I don’t want to stop seeing them for the same reasons I didn’t socially distance over covid.</p>

        <p>I understand that there are concerns and hesitancy about the vaccine, but I think that suggesting that unvaccinated people should stay away from the vaccinated is a bit of a stretch.  We criticize the vaccinated people who suggest that the unvaccinated should be ostracized, so I just hope that we don't fall into the same way of thinking on the other side.</p>
<p>I am not planning on getting the vaccine and I vehemently oppose these restrictions (I'm in Ontario), but we're not going to move forward with reclaiming freedoms if we decide that vaccinated people carry an invisible threat.</p>
<p>I have friends and family who have been vaccinated and none of them (men or women) have had any side effects related to ovulation, sexuality, etc.  I just want to offer another take on this situation where we don't villainize those who were vaccinated for one reason or another.</p>

        <p>Though the idea of vaccinated persons effecting unvaccinated persons seems ‘far fetched’, ‘asinine’, or ‘implausible’, several research doctors have concluded that, due to the endless production of the spike protein from the shots, it’s entirely possible for an unvaccinated person to be effected, as eventually, vaccinated persons will be exhaling with contaminants of the spike protein. </p>
<p>The spike protein, of course, is Syncytin-1, which is absolutely vital in the development of human placenta. The body is training itself to combat the protein needed to develop a fetus. And it is being spread around.</p>

        <p>It is coincidental yes. I don't know if there's actual data on this, is it everywhere around the world or just one place? Everyone in the UK is surrounded by vaccinated people as half the population are vaccinated, are there masses of women here that are having these problems? Or just the same amount as everywhere else? I'm not ruling out the vaccine being the cause, just conscious that it is similar to claiming it's due to a new covid variant. I'm a sceptic of everything, not just covid.</p>

        <p>That’s good we should always question things. Lack of critical thinking is what got us into this mess. I think it’s mainly based on personal anecdotes, although I do remember seeing that there will be a study about it now. Guess we’ll have to wait for updates. However I’d trust my experience and the experience of people around me over whatever the hell they allow scientists to release these days</p>

        <p>We can’t really do any good if we start operating with the idea that all vaccinated people are dangerous to be around. That is the reverse of what we’re fighting against. The Doomers have constantly tried to sell us that even healthy people are actually sick, so we need to stay away from them. We can’t fall into the same trap. This won’t be good for anyone. Even if it’s possible that this might be the case with the spike protein, idk how we could ever hope to regain any aspects of the old normal if we start acting like all vaccinated people are going to make us sick. It’s just social distancing in the reverse. And personally, I’m a 28F who wants babies soon, but I’m not going to stay away from my mom and all family members who are vaccinated.</p>
