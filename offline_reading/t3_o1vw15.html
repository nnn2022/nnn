        <p>The nuance your missing is how Germany went from inclusive of jews, to having their own citizens celebrate as they get taken away on the cattle cars. </p>
<p>It didn't happen over night as if the government demanded the genocide to happen and people just complied. It took years of installing hate and fear against the jews.</p>

        <p>I just hope that the majority of the population don't actually consider the unvaccinated as a disease vector to be eliminated. </p>
<p>We will see what happens. Some Redditors seem comfortable calling us plague rats. Wonder if it will become mainstream.</p>

        <p>I do agree with you, that kind of language should be banned because it is hate speech but unfortunately Conservatives believe it's part of freedom of speech.</p>
<p>It's the same as saying immigrants bring diseases or are rapists for example or that LGBTQ should be segregated from marriage or that they're somewhat dangerous to kids. </p>
<p>That being said, if you refuse to wear a mask and also refuses the vaccine you're indeed a disease vector. I don't think you should be eliminated, that's quite ridiculous.</p>
<p>Think about traffic laws, they exist for a reason and there are consequences for offenders such as having your license revoked or even jail time if your negligence has proven to be fatal. </p>
<p>There's already precedent, for example;</p>
<p>&rt;Several states criminalize one or more behaviors that pose a "low or negligible risk* for HIV transmission. </p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/states/exposure.html#:~:text=Several%20states%20criminalize%20one%20or,disclosure%20to%20needle%2Dsharing%20partners.</p>
<p>And the worst part is, I'm sure you agree with those laws though.</p>

        <p>I am of the opinion that democracy and all resulting laws and legislation is just a fucking distraction from the actual issues. </p>
<p>LGBTQXYZ marriage is not a fucking issue. The issue is why we are allowing a system that requires marriage to make life fair. People should NOT need to get married for government tax breaks, Heath Insurance, investments. Marriage is a religious institution that the "government" repurposed as another form of fucking control.</p>
<p>If two consenting adults want to agree to spend their lives together it is really nobody else's fucking business. The fact that the government makes it their businesses is disgusting and should be stopped.</p>
<p>Any law that is not granting us freedom is a law that should be questioned. Especially laws that take others freedom away.</p>

        <p>I fully endorse the second and third paragraph. </p>
<p>Where I do disagree with you is that I believe that freedom of individuals must be limited for individuals to fully enjoy freedom. </p>
<p>For instance, I think we can both agree that every individuals have the right to live and that murder is bad, to ownership and that thieving is bad, to self autonomy and that rape and slavery is bad. </p>
<p>But laws or rules against those behaviors would take the freedom away of killers, of thieves, of rapists and of slavers. </p>
<p>This is obviously pushed to the extreme, but every laws taking some freedom away are not always a bad thing. </p>
<p>On a more realistic scale, you mentioned in your previous comment that people were calling for people like you to be exterminated, so which freedom should be predominant? </p>
<p>The freedom of those people to express their wish to see you being killed and perhaps even manage to extremize someone to the point he might actually kill an anti-masker, we'll come back on that later, or your freedom to live? </p>
<p>I must admit that it is extremely ironic that you're believing that we're in some way out to kill you while anti-health measures have literally killed many workers enforcing them, suggesting that the reality is completely different than what you believe it to be.</p>
<p>Think of the senseless murder of Calvin Munerlyn, father of 8 kids, a security agent, or Laquita Willis, a clerk working at a dollar shop.</p>

        <p>Its really hard to judge a societys morality. There are some places in the world that stone women for being the victim of rape. The population has been indoctrinated to see that behavior as virtuous. </p>
<p>While there are many laws I'm sure we could agree on, I would argue, that agreement is a result of being raised in societies that share similar values. It does not in anyway imply that it is correct or the most ethical simply because the total population has been indoctrinated to agree.</p>
<p>The objective reality is not easily available to us as members of the same society we are criticizing.</p>

        <p>I would argue that even in countries where death penalty still exists, which includes the USA, it is widely accepted that the act of murder is immoral. </p>
<p>Rather, the difference lies in what are the exceptions to that general rule. </p>
<p>Either way, that's a bit beyond the point. Mainly because I think(hope) I can assume that most people on this sub agree with me that murder, rape, thieving and slavery are immoral. </p>
<p>That, as such, you agree with me on the concept that <em>some</em> types of rules must be created to restrict freedom in order for all individuals to enjoy freedom. </p>
<p>That's what the Constitution is, a set of rights and restrictions meant for rights to not impinge on other rights. </p>
<p>All that being said, I think that people like the ones on this sub, I don't know about you but the ones that denies the science and are pushing over the top conspiracy theory, such as masks being precursor to nazism, have been a better ally to the ones wanting to use the crisis to restrict our rights than pro-health measures. </p>
<p>For one, these accusations have helped medias discrediting and shun valid arguments against the government behavior during the crisis. </p>
<p>Many are critiquing the government for focusing on saving the system rather than saving lives or for using the crisis to enforce surveillance laws that are permanent in nature rather than temporary like the measures that are so often decried here. </p>
<p>But they're not heard, sensationalism sales, claims like the ones made here are sensationalistic but they do not sound realistic to most people, yet they're the ones that sticks while claims that are more tamed and probably more accurate are ignored, even here. </p>
<p>Or even worst, valid claims are used to raise angers at the wrong target. Like when the comparison between vaccine being free vs insulin being pricy(in the US) is made, I mean, you ought to know that the problem is not that the vaccine is free as much as insulin is not in the US. </p>
<p>Anyway, I wrote enough, but please do think about it even if you disagree at first.</p>

        <p>Youre so misguided, its not that people would never ever conspire its that not only would medical professionals need to taught incorrectly but 1000s of them would have to be in on some grand vaccine conspiracy that you people seem to believe. Its crazy that doctors spend 4+ or even 8+ years either learning for you to tell them theyre lying to you about something you probably cant even comprehend. The IDEA of what youre saying is not only impossible and implausible but it shows youre unstable if you think soooooo many people are banding together to scam you and the public.... while being part of the public?

        <p>This comment is so convoluted it hurt me to read. The idea that scientists are only studying if vaccines are safe and are entirely neglecting studying the downsides because of funding is laughable. Proving a vaccine is safe is literally the same thing as proving its not unsafe. Just because you word it differently doesnt make it a different thing lol. Im done, your head is fucked, you believe whatever you want to believe and you twist things to convince yourself but they dont even make sense.</p>

        <p>The nuance you're missing is the entire history of Germany during the interwar period. </p>
<p>'It took years of installing hate and fear against the Jews'</p>
<p>Sorry, but the German population was largely antisemetic, or at the very least apathetic to the treatment of jews already by that point. A combination of the fact that they <em>elected Hitler</em> and that much of Germany believed in the backstab myth that it was Jews and communists who backstabbed Germany's war effort during WWI which caused their defeat.</p>

        <p>The topic is more specific than "the holocaust," I would hope that would be apparent to anyone reading the short post title. No one is claiming making people wear masks is the same as killing them.  If you can read a little more carefully, I'm not interested in a discussion with you.</p>

<p>It will be a perfectly fair comparison when they do start carting off the unvaccinated swine to re-education camps. </p>
<p>Till then it is just alarmist hyperbole. We should not fear when the government segregates populations. It is for our own best interest to let them. We should obey without question.</p>

        <p>Is your idea of "listen to scientists and experts" actually "listen to marketing"?</p>
<p>I have a pretty strong hunch it is.  In fact, because if your strange speak to authority wording, I'm quite certain it is.</p>
<p>No, we definitely should not listen to marketing.</p>
<p>Instead if listening to marketing agendas, we need to: determine what the ACTUAL problem to be solved is, then we need to see what relevant knowledge and evidence that science has regarding that.</p>
<p>Then we need to consider what is ordinary, then we need to consider if the ordinary is being properly applied, or not.</p>
<p>It isn't.  Then we need to test properly applying the ordinary and see if that adequately solves the problem.</p>
<p>If proper application of the ordinary does not meaningfully solve the problem, then and ONLY then can we consider if something extraordinary might be necessary.</p>

        <p>You're the one that wrote an appeal to authority.</p>
<p>Science isn't a person, or some select people, or a job title, or a degree, or some credentials.</p>
<p>It's a methodology.</p>
<p>Experts are individual people, subject to all the same shortcomings as anybody else.  When you study the mistakes of history, what do you learn about people?</p>
<p>There's reasons why appeal to authority is ALWAYS a logical fallacy.  You should study about them.</p>
<p>Marketing and science are in opposition to each other.  Marketing is a cause of a lot of trouble in the world in general, and almost all of the most significant trouble for the past ~~two weeks~~ 16 months.</p>

        <p>I didnt write any appeal about authority but maybe for scientific knowledge. when i dont have the time setup a study and gather data myself i rather let that people do who do this for their living. 
And if the vast majority of these people Independently come to the Same conclusion i tend to believe that. </p>
<p>What‘s the alternative? Educating yourself via random websites? Phishy YouTube Videos of People collecting Information they find on These random Websites?</p>
<p>Nah. Atleast in germany we have a strongly Independent science sector which is 100% more accurate and precise than any Information you gather yourself randomly on the Internet can be.</p>
<p>I think there can be marketing for scientific findings. Not to make them more accurate or to make them better describing realtity of whatever, but to let more People know what you found. In the End Every scientific magazine is some Kind of Marketing for findings. And science like we Human are doing only works better the farther spread every finding is.</p>

<p>&rt;Educating yourself via random websites? Phishy YouTube Videos of People collecting Information they find on These random Websites?</p>
<p>You're arguing against voices in your head.</p>
<p>Apparently you live your life as a sequence of random activities.  Since that's what you do, that's the only way you can relate to other people, and the voices in your head tell you the only possible conclusion is that's what other people do too.</p>
<p>Best wishes to you on coping with those voices in your head, and that living life as random activities thing.  You should stop imagining that that's what other people do too.</p>
<p>Those who do not learn from the mistakes of history are condemned to repeat them.  I'm really sad that Germany is rushing head long down that route.  I've known a bunch of German people in my lifetime that I respected.</p>

        <p>If you make that up as „voices in my head“ tell me, how you make your own Research? How do you educate yourself if not via studying and following current scientific research? </p>
<p>You make many statements about me. Without any proof in fact. Is it because you don’t wanna argue or is it cause of certain  glasses you are seeing through and judging people with?</p>

        <p>I most certainly do not support that nonsense and I do not support funding research to create more virulent viruses leading to a pandemic that killed 3.8M people, destroyed economies, created record high unemployment and plunged many into poverty. Meanwhile all billionaires have profited.</p>
<p>Whether you want to take the vaccine is up to you, but there's plenty of possible side effects, we don't know whether there will be any long term effects, it involves experimental gene therapy, the rollout was supervised by the same people that created the pandemic. We aren't even doing antibody tests before vaccinating people. The media has convinced everyone that adaptive immunity does not exist.</p>
<p>I'd personally rather take my chances and if I do get covid the second time and then die at least I won't have to live in your tech dystopia funded by billionaires.</p>
<p>Felt this needed to be said, not targeting op, it's aimed at the brigades of big pharma supporters.</p>
