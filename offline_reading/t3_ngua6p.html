    <strong>So... My aunt had a stroke recently...And this is what the paramedics asked</strong>
    <p><p>My aunt is on her 60's and had a stroke recently due to high levels of stress (she is not vaccinated).</p>
<p>I didn't go to the hospital with her, but my uncle (who went with her) said that one of the first questions that the paramedics made were: "was she vaccinated recently?"</p>
<p>You may think: "they are just asking how careful they must be with the patient because of COVID"... I disagree, that word... "recently"... was put there for a reason.</p>
<p>Take your own conclusions.  </p>
<p>P.S.: She is showing signs of fast recovery :)</p></p>

        <p>Yeah strokes are caused by blood clots which can happen. They aren't hiding that, just check any gov website for the numbers</p>
