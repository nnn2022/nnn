    <strong>The (Hungarian) Secret Service is in full-swing action against "anti-vax" people</strong>
    <p><p>Main points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a parliamentary committee meeting, it has been disclosed that the Hungarian National Secret Service is in action against 'anti-vaccine' groups and people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obviously not much details, but actions include: discrediting leaders, inciting arguments in groups, trying to break up groups from the inside, either with an operative or by 'convincing' an existing member to action to lower morale and induce churn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's for "public good", so it's okay</p>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>Where there is corruption and dependency of EU money for the benefit of the leading politicians and their friends, it's easy to do what pleases the big corporations and global power influence.</p>
<p>Greece was the first to talk about vaccine passports and travel requirements, and concidentally, Greece is still partly broke/bankrupt, relies on EU goodwill and money.</p>

"It has the secret service on hard-line vaccines</p>
<p>￼</p>
<p>OUR AUTHORAndrás DezsőTRACKING</p>
<p>EPIDEMIC SITUATION+</p>
<p>The secret service is not looking at the operation of the leaders of anti-virus or anti-vaccination propaganda groups with its hands on its lap - according to our information, this was also revealed at Tuesday's meeting of the Parliament's National Security Committee..</p>
<p>The figures who are intensively engaged in anti-virus, anti-vaccination propaganda are in the sight of the secret services, there is a group that the Office of Constitutional Protection managed to discredit in an operational operation - we learned this at the meeting of the National Security Committee on Tuesday. At our request, Zsolt Molnár, the board member of MSZP and Péter Ungár, the LMP member of the committee, did not want to comment on our information, saying that what was said at the committee meeting was a state secret, but they both confirmed that the secret services were doing their job in this area. .</p>

<p>According to a source looking at the area, the secret service can typically weaken organizations by disrupting them, which, with their anti-vaccination propaganda, could pose a threat to epidemiological control, which is precisely the emphasis on vaccination.</p>
<p>It’s not that the secret service has landed on people who don’t want to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Attention is paid to those who, for example, want to increase the camp of anti-virus / highly virus-skeptics, anti-vaccinators for their own business interests and consciously disseminate false information about the coronavirus or even defenses.</p>
<p>There can be several forms of intelligence disruption. Whatever operational operation was initiated by the secret service, it had to be preceded by a very thorough processing. This means that they have to map the internal structure and dynamics of the target group first and only then can they decide how to act against them. It is characteristic of these groups that they spread fake news, misinformation and although there will always be those who fall for them, it doesn’t really matter how big their base is, how many followers they gain, what influence they gain.</p>

<p>The task of the secret service is not the police, so it is not the task of detecting a crime, but of preventing an act dangerous to society, whatever the extremist group. Whatever operation follows a processing job, its steps must be approved by intelligence leaders because it is a “double-edged sword,” a source previously working there explained to our paper who saw several operations. The repository is infinite: sometimes the secret service is integrated into a group through an - already existing - relationship and there seeks to gain informal influence. But it is also common practice to “support” the group from outside, but not to the first-line member, “building” him or her. The goal is most often to break up the group, from which, in the event of a successful action, members or believers perceive only thatthat the mood will get worse, the leading individuals will quarrel with each other, start drilling each other. This method was also used by the secret service in 2006, when it tried to divide the protest groups and voices camping in Kossuth Square - successfully.</p>

<p>Another way is to discredit the group’s speaker in front of believers or a wide audience. In such cases, they go as deeply as possible to the target person's background, which may even include gathering information about their school studies. This is a particularly common method of disintegrating organizations whose leading figure identifies itself as a professional skilled in the scientific field. During each such secret service expiration, they not only find out real information about the target person, but also seek to credit the target person with false statements to his or her narrower or wider environment.</p>
<p>Although we do not know which of the known anti-virus / virus skeptics have come under the scrutiny of the intelligence services and against whom action has been taken, experts familiar with the field would be surprised that the figures who have called the street several times have not been included. their believers, all when grouping is forbidden. Memorable: in March, Gábor Lenkei, who was affiliated with the Church of Scientology, invited his followers for a walk in Budapest, which was stopped by the police, while György Gődény marched on Heroes' Square, and the police took action against nearly two hundred people in the square."</p>
