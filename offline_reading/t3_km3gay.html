        <p>“Dr. Ramers says he knows of several other local cases where health care workers became infected around the time they received the vaccine. He says all the cases illustrate the fact that results aren’t immediate. Even after you start receiving some protection, it won't be full protection.”</p>
<p>This is normal folks. Nothing to see here.</p>

        <p>So what he’s saying is that people need to recognize that your body has been given a small dose of antibodies. These antibodies will replicate within you over the next couple/several days. You can still get sick after receiving the vaccine because you have only the start of the protection, so a large exposure to the virus will still overwhelm that protection. This is the same reason why doctors have been found to get sick more than once. It’s also the reason why they still tell you to wear masks and practice social distancing after getting the vaccine. The antibodies need some time to replicate and give you full protection.</p>

        <p>What do you know about cellular biology? Not much, right? Well you could get the cheat sheet and have all the answers. Or you could learn on the fly because you’re not a dummy. But if you do that, the tests will have the opportunity to wreak havoc on your grade.</p>
<p>This is an analogy for the vaccine. Your immune system is good. But it will need to learn how to fight the virus while the virus is fighting you. The vaccine will teach your body to fight the virus before the virus ever hits your doorstep.</p>

        <p>Well, for one, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">we already know it works.</a>. The vaccine has been shown to be highly effective at stopping infection.</p>
<p>To your 99.7% survival rate, that would go to 100% survival rate, which would equate to the lives of 900,000 people saved.</p>
<p>Beyond that, ICUs will no longer be over capacity, family members will no longer be on ventilators, insurance costs will no longer be through the roof. And most of all, if everyone gets this vaccine, we can all just carry on and enjoy life again without worrying about a virus. Doesn’t matter if you think the virus is overblown or not. If we all get the vaccine, we can put this mess behind us.</p>

        <p>But they have ALL publicly said that the vaccine won’t stop transmission. <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/fauci-vaccines-will-only-prevent-symptoms-not-block-the-virus-195051568.html">Fauci</a> said it just decreases your symptoms. </p>
<p>Soooo...cases will continue to skyrocket. Deaths will pile up. And we won’t reach 100% immunity.</p>
<p>Edit: you’re also saying that the vaccine will eradicate Covid since the immunity will increase to 100%. </p>
<p>The flu vaccine has been around 85 yrs and yet the flu is still here. But a vaccine they’ve made in 6 months will now eradicate Covid...when no Coronavirus has ever been eradicated before. </p>
<p>Makes complete sense.</p>

        <p>Well the flu mutates. We fight different strains each year. When you get a flu vaccine, it’s this years three (?) most potent strains. Covid mutates significantly less/slower. So it’s not unreasonable to think that we can eradicate it, much like swine flu and SARS (though there’s some great stories of epidemiology on those)</p>

        <p>But according to experts, the flu has been eradicated this year...because of masks and social distancing...and NOT because of the vaccine. So the vaccine was useless all along. Right? </p>
<p>Fauci has said Covid is here to stay. So eradication is not possible. If it doesn’t stop the spread, doesn’t prevent you from getting sick, or eradicate the virus...then what is the point??</p>

        <p>It’s interesting how you cite Fauci when it’s convenient for you, but refute his recommendations when they’re not.</p>
<p>The numbers for the flu have very reasonable explanations that will be made clear when the scientists get into the data. Until then, let’s just get the vaccine so I can visit my wife’s family, take my son to daycare, and do my job again. If the claiming 23% of people decide against it, then we really can’t do that. And your belief that Fauci’s claim of Covid being here to stay and the government forcing this new normal forever will end up being true. Get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>It’s because he flip flops on everything and has deceived people - so what are you supposed to believe? He LIED to the public about masks back in March - his excuse saying he didn’t want people to hoard masks from hospital workers. And recently he admitted he LIED about herd immunity because he says the public can’t handle the truth. He shamed Anyone that dared to mention herd immunity- calling it a “myth” and saying it’s dangerous and unethical. But now he’s gaslighting, and saying herd immunity is the solution. </p>
<p>For example Read this <a href="https://www.mynews13.com/fl/orlando/news/2020/02/15/disease-expert--flu-a-bigger-risk-in-the-us-than-coronavirus">interview</a></p>
<p>If he’s lied before, he’ll lie again. Yet here you are, blindly trusting and defending a doctor who has lied numerous times. If your personal doctor lied to you, would you ever trust him again?</p>
<p>If masks work, then you should be able to do all the things you want. Nothing is stopping you - except the government. </p>
<p>The only people that need the vaccine are the high risk. Otherwise, we all have our natural immune system to protect us - just like all the other Coronaviruses. </p>
<p>I’m glad to see you are open to discussion about this in a civil manner. There are other experts out there. I hope you keep an open mind and read to what they have to say.</p>

        <p>You call it a lie. I call it a mistake. I remember that situation back in March because I was traveling to Thailand through South Korea (<em>the</em> hotbed at the time). I disagreed with his remarks and continued to wear masks. Despite his remarks, masks were already sold out everywhere we looked. Hospitals were already unable to secure a supply (my brother managed to snag me a small box after getting a shipment at his pharmacy). He made a call to help prioritize frontline workers. It was the wrong call because it continued to confuse and frustrate the general public.</p>
<p>Yes. I trust Doctor Anthony Fauci, a man who’s been working with infectious diseases for almost twice as long as I’ve been alive. A man who works tirelessly to keep the public updated. A man who has defied direct orders from “the most powerful man in the free world” to keep people informed and alive.</p>
<p>If I made as few mistakes as him in my job, I would be made VP of my company. He’s definitely got the hardest job in the government right now. Millions of people are relying on him to navigate the country through this pandemic, despite many people in the government making it harder for him. I don’t think America has handled this pandemic well at all, but it is not his fault and I still consider him the premier expert on this virus. He’ll make mistakes, but that happens (I do wish he’d recognize the mistake and apologize for it, but I guess working for the government, you can’t do that!...)</p>
<p>As per who gets the vaccine. I don’t agree. While you’re right that I can handle Covid if I get it, people with comorbidities, immunocompromised peopled, and children might not. It is our job as citizens to protect those who need protected. If they can’t get the vaccine, we should, so they can’t get it from us. Before you comment on how children can handle the vaccine, there is still much to be learned on the long term effects of the virus. There are still examples of heart defects found in patients who recovered from Covid. So, until doctors tell me that there are no long term effects from those who contracted Covid, I will not let my kid go to a daycare with workers and families that are not vaccinated. The risks these long term effects greatly outweigh the risks of getting the vaccine.</p>

        <p>You realise that if the power hungry politicians didn’t start these lockdowns in the first place then you would have always been able to see your family and friends all day. You’re blaming the wrong people for this lockdown and that’s exactly what they are trying to get you to do. the only risk would be the same risk that we have always had. RANDOM DEATH! It happens. People die. And if it wasn’t covid then it might be a car accident or hun crime or household accidents. A huge percentage of Americans die in their own household simply from heavy appliances falling on them or chemical mishaps. But we aren’t pulling bleach of the shelves just because it can make mustard gas are we. Grow up. Learn to live with the trials and tribulations of life death is just apart of the natural cycle</p>

        <p>The government absolutely fucked this up, and I wholly wish that they would pay for it with their career. I will not be re-electing politicians for the next couple years. However, if the government actually created meaningful plans to stop Covid, and if the general public actually fucking listened to them, we would all be able to go on our merry way. It was this on again off again, I don’t wanna go home bs from both people in the government and people in this sub that keep this shit perpetuating for 9 months.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on New Zealand? Did they handle the coronavirus poorly by electing to lockdown their country for two weeks?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on Sweden? Was their laze fair attitude successful? Personally, I think not.</p>
<p>Either way, I think America did worse than both of them. We failed to curtail the pandemic and only served to extend and depress the public (and economy!). You blame the government, and you’re right to. But I blame the government and you. Your defiance did not make this better, it made it worse. Whether you think so or not, it’s true. Because the government used people like you as an excuse for it’s failure, allowing them to try again and again and again. r/NoNewNormal is part of the problem, whether you believe it or not. You are not heroes, you are aggrevators, just adding more chaos into the pot.</p>

        <p>I live in Australia. We handled the lockdown great. The lockdown wasn’t the problem it was as you said how america fucked around and opened up and closed whenever it pleased. Australia had case tracing and mass testing which made this whole thing possible. What I don’t agree with is the fact that our state had a mask mandate in place for far far too long and we’re shutting down stupid things like beaches and parks but keeping fast food open where people cannot social distance</p>

        <p>Yeah, Australia did a great job. I have some friends in NSW that kept an excellent running commentary on all the trials and tribulations the government put you guys through. I don’t mind the mask mandate, as it’s no harm no foul. Though the corporate-controlled government allowing places like fast food and stores to remain open, while small businesses and public spaces were forced closed will forever infuriate me. I remember in early summer, people in California were being issued citations for kayaking in the ocean or running outside. I understand their thoughts were to not sidetrack first responders when they should be focusing on the pandemic, but I don’t recall there ever being evidence for a need of first responders when it came to Covid. Just seemed like security theater, with police issuing protocol enforcement in the few areas they can without corporate repercussions.</p>

        <p>Yes for sure. I think the biggest thing I didn’t like about the masks here in Australia is since we had so few people out on the street in Melbourne. Anyone caught without a mask was arrested on the spot and taken back to the station and forced to wear a mask. At least that’s what I saw in many videos including one of a 16 year old girl getting slammed to the ground by a middle aged male cop just for not wearing a mask. She claimed to have an exemption but regardless we should not be body slamming children just for not wearing a mask</p>

        <p>Why do I totally believe that?... Jesus thats ridiculous. I don’t wear a mask when I’m walking in the park. I go outside for fresh air, not to smell my breath... I understand why people do, but it should not be required when walking in an empty park. I understand that there’s a difficult and blurry line of when to put a mask on (how crowded is too crowded to be without a mask?) and I wish people had better judgement than they do, but no matter what it should be, it was not handled well.</p>
<p>I don’t pretend to have the right answers, but it’s pretty easy to see when an answer is wrong. And the government’s unwillingness to go back to the drawing board (like how they fucked up schools in America and refused to knuckle down and figure it out) really upsets me.</p>

        <p>For sure. And just for some clarity in this situation the girl was walking on the sidewalk of the inner city but since it was at the beginning of the lockdown the streets were basically empty. You were only allowed out of your house for essential reasons and thy were pulling everyone over to make sure they were going to the right places and not going to see people they weren’t meant to. It was a police state at one point for sure it’s kinda scary to think it could go back to that any second with the “second wave” and people would accept it right away. </p>
<p>The reason I know people will accept it no matter what is that even though we haven’t had any new cases in australia for weeks now. And even though my own country town has been covid free for even longer than that. People are still wearing masks around daily to do their normal errands. It’s quite sad to see once happy carefree people wearing masks and giving you dirty looks if you’re not wearing a mask when there are no active cases in the state. It’s a weird mentality. Almost us against them</p>
<p>I think I’ve found the good middle ground where I’ll wear a mask if it calls for it but if there are no cases I’m not going to wear a mask into a store that permits it</p>

        <p>I actually had to look it because despite logic, that would suck. Yeah. Babies actually would contract polio from the the vaccine itself. Thank goodness the disease has been eradicated and we no longer need to get that vaccine.</p>
<p>However the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are much different than traditional vaccines. Rather than getting a weakened strain of the virus (like we do with flu shots), we are being given proteins that contain “the code” to antibodies that can fight the virus. So, instead of getting weakened practice dummies for our immune system to fight, our immune systems are simply given a cheat sheet with no practice necessary. This is the first vaccine to ever be put to public use that uses this and is only possible with modern technology. It was able to be brought to public use so quickly because there is a 0% chance of contracting coronavirus <em>from</em> the vaccine itself and all known side effects from mRNA vaccines are considered mild and easily handled.</p>
<p>Still, you reminded me of the shit storm the world went through with polio. Thank fuck for vaccines and the doctors that helped eradicate that damned disease.</p>

        <p>Really? Your going to claim a never before used developed in six months vaccine is not only safe to use but effective? Based on what? Six months of research from two incredibly corrupt giant pharmaceutical corporations? Who are you that you so blindly believe this shit?</p>

        <p>mRNA vaccines have been around for a long time, just not feasible for human use. My mother worked with them on mice 20-something years ago. We know a whole lot about how they work, how effective they are, and how safe they are. We just couldn’t easily manufacture them, store them, or transport them. </p>
<p>I’m with you that pharmaceutical corporations are corrupt, but the scientists who develop vaccines are not. This vaccine is truly amazing and will pave the way for countless medical discoveries over the next 10-20 years.</p>
<p>As for who I am. I am an engineer with a family who has reason to fear a global pandemic. I am a son to a medical biologist with a PhD in education so she can easily teach me how these things work. I am a brother to a pharmacist, a pharmaceutical oncologist, and a currently serving soldier. I am a human being who wants to have reasonable conversations with people to make the world a better place and see through the darkness that our government and corporations want us to see.</p>
<p>But most of all, I want to take my son to museums and restaurants and family gatherings again. I will continue to do my best to shape the world in a way that I can do that.</p>

        <p>I’m sure and i’m an ass busting line cook without all those amazing family members and options that you have, where i’m from i can’t afford children, movies, museums or really any fun shit even if it wasn’t a 2 hour drive away. To say that “normal” consumer lifestyle is the number one priority to you to return to only shows how out of touch you are. So take your experimental cocktail if that’s what you think you’ll get in return and have fun!</p>

        <p>I don’t think you understand how the vaccine or mRNA works. MRNA is not conserved in a cell and without the proper modifications from the nucleus does not last long. MRNA must be methylated and carry a poly A tail in order to last long enough to make multiple peptide chains.</p>

        <p>Not pointless for those whom the symptoms would be very dangerous. For the rest it's probably a waste of time. Which is why insisting healthy people get it is a complete waste of time and resources. Treat it like a flu vaccine, give it to those at risk who want it.</p>

        <p>I have a lot of theories on this but I can't say for sure on what it is... it could be the effects of the vaccine along with the PCR test being used which we know is not all that reliable and another theory I have is that maybe the vaccine lowers the immune system so much that they were super susceptible to the virus and caught it, either way it's a clear pass for me on the vaxx</p>
