    <strong>First time posting, thought I would share this.</strong>
    <p><p>I live in a small town in South Western Ontario where mask mandates are still in full effect. I went into a local bar and grill last night to pick up some food. I walked past some people on the patio preparing to put my mask on as I went inside but as I looked around it appeared as though pretty much no one had a mask on so I kept mine off and approached the masked waitresses to inquire about my order. No one said anything so I paid for my food and was on my way.</p>
<p>I know this isn't much of a victory but it's the first time since mask mandates came in that I entered an establishment mask less. I told my wife and she was like "Duh, they were eating and drinking!" but all I saw were people with no masks on enjoying themselves and I wanted to be a part of that.</p>
<p>Hopefully things get better around here, my wife told me yesterday that trudeau is trying to push through a bill that would require all federal workers to be vaccinated so if we didn't already know, this tells us everything we need to know about where he stands and what he is willing to push on everyone in Canada. It filled me with rage to know what he (trudeau) is trying to do and how far he might try to take it.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone here for sharing your stories, they have helped a lot.</p></p>

        <p>I went to a busy resort area of South Carolina a couple weeks ago and saw only a hand full of masks the entire time.  It was like living on planet Earth pre dystopian times.</p>

        <p>Sounds like a nice place üëç. Here in Canada masks are still mandated indoors so businesses can be fined so it's nice to see them start to push back or ignore the rules.</p>

        <p>you are doing it right.</p>
<p>be prepared to comply if you need to, but FFS stop the blind obedience.</p>
<p>no one wants this shit any more, make them tell you and a high percentage won't because they all know it's bullshit.</p>
<p>the employees are just trying to keep their job, so they comply but they are largely over it.</p>
<p>some tactics i have seen when entering stores .</p>
<p>"would you like a mask?"  or "can i get you a mask?" </p>
<p>depending on my mood :</p>
<p>"no thank you"</p>
<p>"i don't need one"</p>
<p>"are you still on with that nonsense?"</p>

        <p>Thanks, Ya it looks like the covid craze is crumbling around here. I live in a small town near a city that borders the US so mandates are still in place but my wife told me she went in to a home hardware yesterday and almost all of the employees were going about their business without masks and a guy that looked like the owner or manager was walking around with his mask pulled down under his chin talking up close to customers so that is reassuring, It sounds as though people running the some stores are no longer caring about the government and their mandates.</p>

        <p>"Comply if you need to" that's the one part of your post I disagree with. You always have a choice, it just might not be as convenient. If we want this to end, ever, we need to stop complying, period.</p>
