        <p>Think you need to look into Fauci's wisdom on aids, sars, COVID, and advising Bill Gates while Bill reverses his decision about making vaccine patent public.  Fauci has been nothing but a hack back pedaling his science when real scientist prove him wrong for his entire career!</p>

<p>Maybe just by people with an agenda?</p>

        <p>All that can be true of Fauci, but it can also be true that ivermectin is a useful treatment and prophylactic against covid. The fact that you can’t have a discussion about alternative treatment of covid, even amongst experts in the field, is a red flag. Plenty of solid studies out there proving ivermectin, remdesivir, fluvoxasamine, and other drugs are showing good results. If Fauci is looking out for our welfare, he should at least be willing to discuss these treatments. As of now, it seems he is siding with the vaccines that have significant side effects. Ivermectin is cheap and has had billions of doses distributed. Not sure why they are stonewalling it, unless it’s for nefarious reasons.</p>

        <p>Clearly nefarious. Or it is because it is unproven in its benefits. A very small study showed it may help, in India, not under ideal conditions. A larger and better study showed it didn't do anything and recommended it would need further study.</p>
<p>I mean, it's not difficult is it?</p>

        <p>If that’s the case, why stifle discussion? A large meta analysis of 18 studies showed it had statistical significance, yet if you try and discuss that it’s quickly blocked.</p>

        <p>Some studies showed potential benefits, but these studies were largely flawed https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/tables/table-2c/</p>
<p>If you are going to 'science' you have to do it properly.</p>
