    <strong>Doomer friend discarded me as soon as she learned that I disagree with her ideas.</strong>
    <p><p>For the past year since I have known this person, I have listened to her rant about how much she hates Trump, how anti-maskers should be imprisoned, her endless fretting/fear-mongering over COVID, how she believes voter fraud and lockdown skepticism is nothing but conspiracies...and I sat in silence. I have comforted her when she’s been afraid of a disease with a 99% survival rate. I have respected our differences. I knew I couldn’t share my own ideas without making her uncomfortable. So I shut my mouth and tried to calm her down.</p>
<p>Today she wanted to know what I thought of the protest at the Capital. I told her I didn’t think she’d like my stance on the subject. She continued to push me to share my thoughts. So I told her that people feel voiceless and they’re protesting because they don’t know what else to do. They feel like they’re not being heard and people are rightfully scared and angry. </p>
<p>She said she disagreed with me, which is fine. She said I’m a crazy cultist who’s been brainwashed by Trump (although I explained to her that I’m not a fan of any politicians). Then when I asked her why we couldn’t just respectfully disagree. I told her that since I’d known her, I’d been aware that she’s a liberal and I respected her different ideas. I told her that I didn’t understand why she wanted to allow politics to get in the way of our friendship and that I’d stayed silent to keep her comfortable and that I didn’t find that fair. </p>
<p>She went on to say I’m a terrorist, that I’m an affront to democracy, and a threat to the American people’s freedom. This coming from someone who howls with rage when people don’t put muzzles on their faces. Someone who wants to have anti-maskers sent to prison. I’m threatening freedom by having different beliefs. </p>
<p>I was there when her ex committed suicide. I was there when she was tempted to go back to drinking. None of that mattered to her as soon as she put the conservative label on me. </p>
<p>I’m sitting here crying wondering why I ever let someone into my life who I couldn’t be myself around. I’m angry that I was her doormat for so long. I’m angry that I cared so much about someone who cares so little about me.</p>
<p>I’m done. I’m done silencing myself to make others comfortable. I’m tired of listening to my therapist interrupt my sessions to rant about how Trump and COVID are the root cause of all evil. I’m tired of being bullied, intimidated into silence, and disrespected. I’m tired of being the one sacrificing my authenticity to make these relationships work. I’m done tolerating the “tolerant left”.</p></p>

        <p>I’m tired of leftists being able to speak their minds to their hearts content and shaming others for having different opinions. I’m so tired of the division and the hatred that they spew. Im surrounded by Doomers and the isolation is killing me.</p>

        <p>To be honest, you had an unstable friend and a really shitty therapist. The country is extremely polarized right now so finding environments to have constructive conversations “across the aisle” is difficult. Sadly, the loudest people also tend to be the most belligerent in most situations and that is especially true when it comes to politics. All that being said, I promise you there are good, nice, authentic people on both sides. I hope you find someone who respects your boundaries but I also hope you don’t give up on having those conversations. We all need to talk less and listen more, especially your therapist!</p>

        <p>People are already getting ID'd on Twitter and fired for attending the protest in DC this week. </p>
<p>Number of people fired from their jobs for getting ID'd while rioting for BLM? Zero. </p>
<p>I'm so tired of them acting like the victims when their ideology gets a pass on every kind of bad behavior and they can literally point a finger at people and have them summarily canceled.</p>

        <p>Social media and bots on the platforms and their echo chambers, along with schools have convinced them their opinion is a huge majority. The diff is conservatives just want to be left alone and therefore don’t care to share so it gives the impression that they don’t exist. The leftists are shocked when they meet one. They seem to forget that 70+ MILLION people voted for the evil orange Hitler</p>

        <p>It's secular humanism.  Pints with Aquinas did a recent video with Steven Rummelsberg that compares the left/secular humanism to the 7 tenets of the Satanic Temple and...  Wow, they're essentially the same.   https://youtu.be/rxeF7m7gybw</p>

        <p>The value in the video is looking at them through a traditional Catholic lense - particularly St. Augustine and his writings - City of God.  It highlights the problems, and where secular humanism/7 tenets can take you and society.</p>

        <p>We’re dealing with children, who are only capable of black and white thinking. In adults, such type of thinking is a classic hallmark of borderline personality disorder. If you look into it, many of the traits present in BPD are also present in leftists. I’m not saying any of them have BPD - far from it - but I think it provides some insight into their minds.</p>
<p>The best way to deal with someone with BPD? Leave them and let them destroy someone else - don’t engage them. Let them wallow in their own misery. They’re not worth the emotional toll they take on you.</p>

        <p>wow, you were there when you helped her through a suicide AND sobriety? The only words I would have parted her with is "I can understand what [suicidal ex] was thinking"</p>
<p>You can find avenues to be happy and it doesn't have to involve a therapist. Especially if she is interrupting YOU to rant, if any therapist is ranting during my session it would follow that I'm the one who should be getting paid.</p>

        <p>Satanism is a real ideology with real characteristics and real adherents. If OP is doing wrong by accusing someone of following a Satanist ideology, then you are doing the same wrong by accusing the OP of holding a witch-hunting ideology. Your objections are hypocritical and don't even make sense. What's more, OP didn't even claim himself to have any religious affiliation to begin with. He was just making a factual statement about an ideology and that's it.</p>

        <p>I look at that differently. I think it’s important to point out the correlations between religion and ideologies. We can currently see those who have become so politically ideological on the left and right that it does have a lot of religious parallels. They blindly choose to worship their chosen “leaders”. They are willing to fight and die because the other side are heretics. Heretics are natural sinners regardless of their individuality. They must be converted or they are to be eradicated.</p>
<p>We see the same type of thing happening with Fauci, the CDC and science. If someone says “you don’t believe in science” as if that somehow is a trump card that only they can use. That statement is dumb as hell, because it literally means nothing. If someone says something like that I guarantee if you asked what science? The concept of science? The science behind masks? Testing? Covid? Then I would say I do believe in science and I would like for you to sit down, show me the scientific literature of what u are speaking of, and then I feel I could answer that question appropriately. Because if you are forcing me to say wear a mask because science. You better have a damn good way to back that claim up. Forcing people to wear something is insane. </p>
<p>If I went down to let’s say a pride parade and began demanding everyone wear snow pants because science. And all that meant was I heard a guy from a government funded institution like the cdc say it. That would go over wonderfully. Even though fat Men’s hairy butt cheeks could make one have Covid symptoms.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry. I lost friends from all of this too but fuck it... If I don't trust you to have my back during a revolution then I don't need you around anyway 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>
<p>The funny thing is, your friend probably says exactly what you did regarding the Capitol ransack but about the BLM protests that got out of control over summer...and that's okay. But if they aren't protesting something SHE agrees with then it's wrong.</p>
<p>At least these folks ransacked a government building to protest the government instead of fucking up private businesses that aren't doing anything to them personally.</p>

        <p>Yes, that was exactly a point I made to her. She agreed that the looting and destroying businesses was not okay, but still insisted the protest at the Capital was against democracy. She said they were trying to replace who the American people voted for with their cult leader Trump. Basically she vomited all of her hatred for conservatives onto me. I think COVID is a bullshit agenda and I think there was voter fraud.</p>

        <p>I have a friend who would get very upset when I expressed opinion they strongly opposed and they would shut me down. So we can't even have a conversation. I didn't want to fight with this person. And I feel like we can have strong disagreements and still stay friends. You can always find common ground somewhere I believe. </p>
<p>Sucks this happened to you. It sounds like you guys were close.</p>

        <p>I hate to hear that, I’m sorry. I guess I am an odd sort of person because I like to listen to different opinions since it helps me think for myself and draw my own conclusions. The way other people think is always interesting to me. So when she’d rant, I’d be genuinely interested in her thoughts on the subjects because I wanted to know why she thinks the way she does. Instead of respecting my individuality and approaching my thoughts from a curious stance she chose to discard the entire friendship.</p>

        <p>Never fear expressing your thoughts. If your family or friends can't have a civil discussion or even just agree to disagree then that's on them, not you. These issues are being used to divide people who would normally get along over their differences. People are tense and not forgiving in these times because of fear instilled into them</p>
<p>If you let fear consume you too much you become one of these people. The fear makes people see your opinion as a threat and they begin to dehumanize you.</p>

        <p>Your friend basically wants a Bashar Al-Assad.</p>
<p>During the Syrian uprising, Bashar Al-Assad labeled anyone who joined a protest as a terrorist and ordered his military to kill all protesters. This has led to a civil war.</p>
<p>Your friend is desperate for a civil war to crush any dissent or anyone that does not want a litterial dictator in American soil or a Chinese like cultural revolution that will bind, torture and kill people who are even slightly of right-wing. </p>

        <p>Syria has and has always had a strong, majority demographic in favor of Bashar Al-Assad. Just like Libya had in favor of Gaddafi. In both cases the "protesting" leading to civil war was highly inorganic, being largely provoked by Western elements both on the internet and on the ground. In both cases, the protests were infiltrated and used as a cover for foreign militants who disguised themselves as civilians, killing members of local law enforcement and state military while shielding themselves with crowds. In both cases, organic protestors were also targeted by yet more foreign militants, this time disguising themselves as state actors and raining indiscriminate sniper fire on members of the crowds from rooftops above the gatherings. All of this was plainly observable from every angle, being attested to on the internet by a broad assortment of local citizens the entire time it was ongoing. Maybe next time learn some shit</p>

        <p>I think it's time every one is going to have to start telling their truths. It's easy for them to label and judge everyone, when everyone is scared to speak their truth for fear of this exact reaction. I get it. But it's time to stop letting these people run all over everyone and everything that doesn't fall in line with their narrative. I'm sorry you went through that, sounds like that person has a lot of baggage, aside from her narrow minded judgements. Hugs</p>

<p>IN REAL LIFE.</p>
<p>The internet is heavily censored and leftists live in echo chambers. It's SO FREEING when you start expressing yourself without worrying about their temper tantrums.</p>
<p>I wish everyone was brave enough to try it. I just got denied service at a dispensary for not wearing a mask - even though I was using curbside pickup. I'm not upset at all, actually I feel really liberated. Nothing is worse than self-censoring, it's so demoralizing.</p>

        <p>I honestly was thinking before that I couldn’t care less about friendships at the moment. I have a couple of friends left who are still capable of disagreement and being respectful, but most everyone else is in the hive mind about COVID, Biden and everything else. Granted they use the doomer talking points (“What’s wrong with a mask?” “But if it saves one life...”) but they at least act like adults otherwise. </p>
<p>I agree with you that people don’t know what else to do and feel ignored. I’ve been thinking for months, even pre-election, that we were a ticking time bomb as a country. For months we have been told to avoid others, be unemployed, stay inside and basically do nothing except computer socializing. Is it any wonder so many tempers blew and NOW everyone’s mad that they did? </p>
<p>Never mind that the people mad at the protestors themselves have also played a role by refusing to listen to opposing viewpoints and bullying Trump supporters, saying vile things about them, and made anti-America jokes while worshipping leaders like Ahern and Trudeau. Oh and applauding things like college kids getting kicked out of school for the horrible sin of socializing! </p>
<p>The left now wants unity and love that they never attempted for four years. It’s hilarious really. But they’ll turn on Biden the second they don’t get $2,000 checks for the rest of time.</p>

        <p>thank you - i thought the same thing last summer with the BLM protests and riots.</p>
<p>you know why people are doing this? boredom. we all need a way to vent some steam in a healthy way, to express themselves.</p>
<p>my god, when i heard kids in my neighborhood setting off fireworks last summer, i was relieved! i was like, "YES! FUCK SHIT UP! BLOW SOME SHIT UP! FIREWORKS! AMERICA! FREEDOM!" steal some beers! smoke a cigarette! dabble in sex! have fun! touch each other! be happy!</p>
<p>this is what happens when we become isolated from one another.</p>
<p>you will stick folks inside their homes for months on end - sometimes without jobs and incomes - without purpose, without meaning, without exercise, without education, without social interaction, without concerts, without new movies, without sports, without hugs, without meetings, without small talk chit chat? and more often than not, without money!</p>
<p>without small talk, without flirting, without "polite" convo, without dates, without sex, without physical interaction, without play dates for kids - wholly absent of normal human social interaction?</p>
<p>and you expect them to be okay? </p>
<p>oh, and without no end in mind. this is all indefinite! might never end! no hope!</p>
<p>NO. none of us are okay!</p>
<p>everyone. has. cracked.</p>
<p>left. right. center. liberal. conservative. moderate. man. woman. child. N/A.</p>
<p>we're mega-fucked.</p>
<p>i had an amazing therapist once tell me that all people - even WASPs who like gin and aren't one for hugging - need eight positive touches a day. a hug, a kiss, a high five, a shoulder squeeze, a back slap, a hair stroke, a friendly hand pat, handshakes - whatever it is, pick what you like, get eight of them. he was a brilliant man. </p>
<p>this is some weird shit, you guys. weird.</p>

        <p>Unfortunate, but I strongly believe that in the end it is a good thing that you are no longer friends.  It sounds more abusive than a friendship should be. </p>

        <p>It’s really weird times we’re in. One of my closest friends is a teacher who told me he reads a ton of stuff on Marxism and communism, puts his pronouns in his social media bios, all the things I don’t agree with. And he knows that. But we get together and talk about other things and where he’s more into socialism and I’m more of a capitalist, he listens to genres of music I don’t, he would pass as hipster chic while I am a button up shirt and loafers guy - we can just enjoy hanging out despite knowing we have differences of opinion. And we aren’t even that old. </p>
<p>It’s really weird to see people that are in their early twenties associate with people who only agree with what they think, and refuse to be around people that don’t think like them. The best part of life is embracing healthy debates and challenging ideas, and meeting new people. It will never happen if people just hate anyone that won’t agree with them</p>

        <p>I’ve lost friends this year too. And I feel I’ve gone out of my way to share my views in a a civil, logical, and balanced manner. I never say anything inflammatory and I back up my views with evidence and reasoning. I’m not one to share conspiracy memes or snarky stuff. Early I simply shared my skepticism of lockdowns and later condemned the BLM violence and destruction. Still, at least 10-15 longtime facebook friends gave me the ax, some of whom I’ve had 15 years of history with. It’s pretty sad. I eventually decided it wasn’t worth it to argue with people online so I stopped sharing my views.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry you were let down by someone you valued as a friend. I hope you have other people in your life who treat you more kindly. I've been going through the same thing myself, though not to that vicious of an extent. Any liberal friends I've let know even some of my true thoughts on what's been happening have cut off contact with me, though they haven't given me the courtesy of saying that's what they're doing. The trauma-based brain-washing is terrifying to witness. Luckily for me, my family (conservative) and my husband's family (liberal), while not sharing our exact views, are much more open and tolerant. </p>
<p>Congratulations on being done with silencing yourself. It's more important than ever to remain true to yourself and your values and to stand up and say what you believe.</p>

        <p>Yep. Showed up at my moms house yesterday. She immediately got in my face screaming at me saying me and my crazy conspiracies about election fraud and lockdowns caused all this. When I took my kids to go leave, she started crying saying I was tearing our family apart. No, people like them is the reason we’re being lead off the cliff. I’m done being silent. Being polite while the other side screams in our face has gotten us here!</p>

<p>But also, some people are just incredibly selfish and ungrateful for everything you did for them.</p>
<p>Looks like your "friend" has both these problems.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to find a small circle of open minded people to share my toughts freely, but i also lost some friends on the way for similar reasons.</p>
<p>Wishing you the best in these shitty times

        <p>Look up "malignant narcissist." Your former friend sounds like one. Your therapist might be one, too, as it's very inappropriate to be subjected to someone else's political rants during your therapy sessions.</p>
<p>If you were raised by a narcissist, this kind of dynamic might feel comfortable to you. Your former friend might have inadvertently done you a favor because it sounds like you've had an important emotional breakthrough. Don't be hard on yourself. Congratulate yourself for having such a moment of clarity, and then educate yourself so you can learn to recognize red flags and set better boundaries.</p>
<p>You said, "I knew I couldn’t share my own ideas without making her uncomfortable." We shouldn't have to walk on eggshells around our friends. A big part of friendship is feeling free to express our thoughts and feelings and knowing we will be treated with respect and compassion even when our friend disagrees with us.</p>

        <p>My stepdad is a diagnosed sociopath, my mother is a covert narcissist...it’s crazy that you mentioned this. In the conversation with this friend she kept insisting that I share my views with her even though I told her I knew she wouldn’t like them. Then sure enough, I told her what I really believe, and she ranted at me. When I told her I “respectfully disagree”, and she said I was being defensive. I think she was mad that I didn’t cower and back down when she lashed out at me. She knows how to passive aggressively intimidate and she’s not exactly the most stable person. </p>
<p>I’ve seen the red flags and I’ve made excuses for her because I felt sorry for her and admittedly I didn’t want to be without friends. I had to estrange myself from my family for safety reasons and moved across the country to get away from them and follow my husbands job. My husband is about as comforting as a brick wall, so I was really hoping to cultivate some meaningful friendships. I suppose that’s why this friends treatment has been so hurtful. Im trying to build a life, and I had thought she was somebody who really cared about me for once.</p>

        <p>Oh, my! Having two parents with anti-social personality disorders is a tough start in life. It's great that you recognized the red flags in the relationship with your former friend and understand why you chose to proceed anyway. That's such helpful insight.</p>
<p>There's so much good information online these days about narcissism and codependence - articles, books, and videos, and people sharing their stories about how they learned to recognize and appreciate healthier relationships. When you're used to narcissists who have no boundaries and create constant drama, healthy relationships can seem cold and boring at first. But it's worth learning to like the more nourishing dynamic. Narcissists might be more "exciting," but they're incapable of offering true love and friendship. They view others as objects and follow a rather predictable pattern: idealize, devalue, discard. Also, it would probably be helpful to find a better therapist, one who's knowledgeable about anti-social personality disorders and who keeps the focus on you instead of his or her political rants. I'm sorry you're experiencing this pain, but hope its lessons empower you to change your standards and find the nurturing, reciprocal friendships you deserve.</p>

        <p>Op. I was the guy who brought my college class together. I held parties twice a week, didn’t have any affairs in the class and tried to help people as much as I could. There are people who are married because I set them up, people in management positions because I encouraged them to pursue their dreams. </p>
<p>They all abandoned me . They have Facebook groups where they use me as a meme . They treat me like an effigy for all the hate that has been programmed into them from the media over the last few years. </p>
<p>It’s very disheartening. I’m constantly depressed because of it. I lost my sense of self because I was genuinely a generous person. Now I just hate myself and want to die. It’s the world we live in now. No body gets out unscathed</p>

        <p>I understand your pain and I wanted to tell you you're not alone. I'm not exactly dealing with the same thing because a lot of my friends are truly tolerant folks but a lot of the "popular" kids in my high school and in one of my classes are exactly what you described as your doomer friend. These folks are very hypocritical. Literally we don't mean harm for them and sat through their opinions on the world and despite the fact we disagree, we still cling on to them and support them. They immediately leave as soon as they spot wrongthink. They're misled. They have good hearts but they forget to use them.</p>
<p>I always thought we can all disagree and still be friendly to each other and co-exist. That's what we all want, right?</p>

        <p>Your former friend is a socially engineered neuro-linguistic programming victim, an NPC who simply responds to trigger words and phrases at the behest of the handlers she has no awareness of. I would definitely not want to be friends with someone like that who's so predictable because all you have to do to know her stance on anything is see what's being said on tv news. She is  not her own person who came to these conclusions through self-reflection and extrapolation of evidence; she merely watched some hypnotic authoritative voiced tv talking heads and shilling experts use emotionally manipulative language to steer their viewers.</p>

        <p>This happened with a chunk of my family. I told them repeatedly that I don’t support Trump, but because I am outraged and disgusted by what’s going on related to Covid and the left’s ardent embrace of fascism, and their hypocrisy, I went from a Bernie supporter to libertarian/ voluntarist/ anarcho- capitalist/ other subreddits with based memes (lol). </p>
<p>When I say “why do you visit grandma if you’re so scared of her catching covid”, send them covid death data from prisons and my city (spoiler: it’s much less than 1%), tell them that their friend who had covid will be fine (spoiler: they’re fine), or tell them that I don’t want a rushed mRNA vaccine which is nothing like any of the vaccines that most people get throughout history, that things will NOT be fully open by May... they don’t hear what I have to say. Literally all they hear is “Trump” when I said several times I don’t even support him. I just got a toxic and angry text message from one of my relatives. It’s gotten to a point that today I decided to just block that entire chunk of the family for a while.</p>

        <p>&rt; She said I’m a crazy cultist who’s been brainwashed by Trump</p>
<p>&rt; This coming from someone who howls with rage when people don’t put muzzles on their faces. Someone who wants to have anti-maskers sent to prison</p>
<p>She is so close to self awareness, but just as nearly everyone else like her us apparently incapable of realizing the hypocracy of her words and actions. People who think like this almost always accuse others of things that they themselves are guilty of. It's called projection, and it is a defining characteristic of left wingers throughout the world. </p>
<p>It sucks, but you're better off without having to deal with hysterical people like this in your life. I'm in a similar position with some good friends of mine who regularly talk about how people who didn't vote for Biden, don't trust the covid vaccine, and that think that the 'pandemic' is being totally overexaggerated are stupid and dangerous threats to society. I have had less and less contact with them over the last few months. People who freak out and get hysterical because your opinions don't completely match theirs are not worth losing any sleep over.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry you had to go through that. I had to leave my therapist for the same reason. It’s a shame that even people you have to pay to vent to are doomers and they can’t stfu about it. It disgusts me. I’ve been through a few and they’re all fucking the same. What a fake a job title. I repeatedly tell them to stay out of politics respectively and it’s just too damn hard for them.

        <p>Wow great post and something I can relate with slightly. Firstly let me say, don’t care what others think, if they want to shut you out of their lives over a political opinion, they were never your friend to begin with. Trust me you might be thinking yes they were but no they weren’t, I’ve thought the same way and the second they knew I supported something they said they’d attack me and they hated me, f this f that. There’s 7.5 billion people or so, you’ll find people who love you. But you’ll never find people who truly love you if you’re not yourself, don’t care what others think and be yourself is my message to you. I’m also sick of this mask bs and Trump derangement syndrome but it’s just the times we live in. Good luck comrade</p>

        <p>When your friends betray you that is always horrible. I can only hope you feel better soon.</p>
<p>P.S. - I would also advise you to fire that therapist. Interrupting your sessions so he/she can rant to you is not behavior that should be tolerated from someone who's supposed to be listening to and helping you, not vice versa.</p>

        <p>You can't reason with madness no matter how hard you try. Best long term strategy is to remove these cancers from your life, short term pain for long term mental wellbeing. Also by not disagreeing from the start people think you agree and then feel empowered to continue their shite, that's how narcissists get away with it for so long.</p>
