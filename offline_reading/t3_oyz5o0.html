        <p>If it's just your hospital thats fine. I guarantee there will be other hospitals doing the same. Personally, I am not biting my tongue as much when it comes to this shit, I used to, but in the last week or two, things are ramping up and I have noticed more people speaking out against it IRL, albeit casually, and less people wearing masks even though there's a mask mandate in my state. The more they push, the more we shove.</p>

<p>That doesn't change what it is though. We need to oppose based on freedom to choose medical procedures. </p>
<p>Sugar was recommended to women to lose weight. Cigarettes were recommended by corporate "doctors". Many drugs and products have been fully approved and done major harm to people. We need to be able to decide our own health care for ourselves. Period.</p>

<li></li>

<p>So let me get this straight. First they didn’t allow you to visit loved ones hospitalized / dying with Covid. And now they’re banning you if you’re unvaxxed. </p>
<p>If this doesn’t coerce you to get vaxxed, then the next step is to ban unvaxxed patients for care and treatment. </p>

<p>I think that based just off of what you told me about your cousin's tenure at this job, and the logic with which she's willing to throw it all away, you may want to speak to her about NOT doing that, because it's a 70K/yr job. Those don't exactly grow on trees.</p>
<p>None of us have to agree about vaccines or antibodies or anything, to maybe put forth the idea that Natural + mRNA-derived antibodies <em>together</em> might either be like adding 1 + 0 (so nothing to lose), or <em>better</em> (like 1+1=2). The exact specifics kind of don't matter, because the point that I'm trying to make is that <em>I believe you at your word</em>, and <em>based on that</em>, getting <em>more</em> antibodies isn't going to replace or reduce the stronger, better ones. She'll just have <em>more</em> overall, the strong good ones and <em>also</em> the shorter-lived, overall-weaker ones.</p>
<p>I get that it can be hard to set aside the... let's call it an "insult" to be asked to get the shot after she's already had COVID. But if I walked up <em>without</em> context and asked "hey, will you get this shot that does literally nothing, in exchange for a $70,000/yr job?", would that maybe be something she might consider?</p>
<p>I don't think you really need to tell <em>me</em> either way; this is all rhetorical. But maybe give it some thought, maybe make a similar case to <em>her</em> before it costs her a shitload of money and possibly some friendships/professional contacts with her soon-to-be-former coworkers.</p>
<p>I don't really particularly care to argue the science here, because no part of this is about that. It's more about asking her if this is the hill she wants to die on, so to speak. If she doesn't have a fallback career option, or would be taking a significant pay cut by changing careers after a decade-and-a-half, then maybe its in her best interest to <em>make her own decision</em>, but have that decision be to Do The Thing. Not because someone asked her to, or demanded that she do it, but because <em>she</em> chose to do it.</p>
<p>I want to take a second to say that you're a good family member for validating her frustration with her job. This here is also clearly a place for venting such frustrations to like-minded people, and you've done a good job of that as well. Your post contributes well to the thread.</p>
<p>What I'd say, is that <em>as</em> a Good Family Member, you've done well to make her feel heard. I would just <em>also</em> say that a Good Family Member has their family's best interests in mind. Regardless of what we might think of the shot, or what she thinks of it, or how any of us feel about this issue, I think we can all agree that a massive pay cut or suddenly leaving a job with a high and steady income for ANY reason might not be in your family members' best interests.</p>
<p>I think if her boss came around, and asked her to put a happy face sticker on her forehead as she worked, and she vented to you that she's thinking about leaving over it, that you'd probably hear her out. You'd let her say her piece, and not judge her, right? But I think once that's done, you might tell her that 70K/yr kind of outweighs the dumb happy face sticker, even if it's kind of a disrespectful ask of a long-term employee. We can move past that indignity, and work through it in time, because the benefit of continued stable employment (especially with the job market how it is right now) is a need that's currently greater than our wounded pride. Also, doing the thing, whether it's the sticker or the real-world issue we're talking about, doesn't really have any downsides because of the 1+0 example above. So it's like, yeah, the <em>sticker</em> doesn't do anything, but better that she sticks it on and makes really good money than have her working a cruddy hourly job that makes <em>tens of thousands</em> of dollars less but doesn't make her wear the dumb sticker. <em>That</em> is the case I'm trying to put forth to you, that I'm humbly suggesting you pass along to her in your own words.</p>
<p>At no point do we have to discuss the issue at hand, or agree/disagree about the shot itself or what it does/doesn't do. I'm just saying, in her case specifically, anything short of straight-up dying or growing a third arm is probably preferable to going from 70K/yr -&rt; 0 -&rt; ???/yr. <em>Especially</em> because of all the people unemployed or desperate for money from this last year. She's gonna have to compete with all of them undercutting her if she's jumping back into the job market, not to mention the difficulty of ensuring another job in the same field or getting anywhere near that money at any job that doesn't require her to go back to school for a couple years to enter a new field. She doesn't <em>HAVE</em> to leave this one, so I'm just saying that maybe as a Good Family Member you should advise that she <em>doesn't</em> do that <em>unless</em> she <em>HAS TO</em> because she <em>isn't</em> being given a choice.</p>
<p>To be really, really clear: neither of you have to believe in this thing (and I'm not trying to change your mind on it) in order for the choice to just acquiesce voluntarily to her job's demands being the best course of action <em>for her</em>. Her <em>specifically</em>. For the <em>money</em>, and any family members/kids/pets she supports with that money.</p>

        <p>What a morally bankrupt argument - you could make literally the same argument about, say, Jews being forced to wear the Star of David in order to keep their jobs. </p>
<p>&rt; It’s so harmless! Just a piece of fabric! Such a little, nothing thing - all you have to do is just <em>agree</em> to wear it and then you can keep your job! Would you really throw everything away over a little piece of fabric? </p>
<p><strong>Even if the vaccine itself were GUARANTEED to be harmless, there is tremendous harm in consenting to the wrongful mandate.</strong></p>
<p>Consent to a wrongful mandate about your physical body is acceptance of your status as property. No, it’s not the equivalent of being put in Auschwitz or whatever - but it’s a (not so?) early step on the road in that direction. </p>
<p>Your comment is educational. It shows how fundamentally differently you view the world, and what you value. You will never have common ground with people who believe that they are <strong>free</strong> - free not only when it’s convenient, not only when no one objects, not only when someone argues that there’d be benefits if they weren’t, but ALWAYS free. </p>
<p>You are ultimately property - that is your choice: property with a great existence, property with some nice privileges that mean can you can mostly do what you want, but property nonetheless. From that position as property, your view here is not just understandable but right - right for you, right for property. It’s not right for free people.</p>
<p>This is not something you have the ability to understand, so don’t worry about it.</p>

<p>last i checked, no one is banned for stating pro-vax facts.  there are plenty of people here who have taken the vaccine and don't regret it.</p>
<ul>
<li>i'm generally supportive of vaccines and have more vaccines than 99% of people on earth.</li>
<li>i've had a vaccine passport (look up the carte jaune) since long before covid.</li>
<li>i have even mentioned multiple pro-vax facts and no one has even dogpiled me with downvotes for it because the stuff i've mentioned is empirically replicable data.</li>
<li>but i have gotten threats of physical violence from fascists for citing the basic clinical stats that prove the current vax and lockdown effort is just pure fascism.  some of these stats include directly citing the failed pfizer clinical.</li>
</ul>
<p>stick with actual science and genuinely meaningful data, not just "the experts say" and bullshit hysteria, and you won't have a problem.</p>

        <p>In case we needed more evidence that this is not a coincidence, CMS (aka, the federal government) announced changes to their prospective payment formulas this week.  One key metric is the reporting of the number of employees that have received the Covid-19 vaccine. This change goes into effect 10/1. Almost all hospital systems across the nation that announced the mandatory vaccination requirement this week set the deadline as 9/30. This is clearly NOT about the safety of their patients and staff, it's about $$$, plain and simple.</p>

<p>across all industries, a general protest in which anyone against the oppression we are facing could participate.  our numbers are much greater than what MSM would like you to believe,..</p>

And the bullshit coming out of your leftists government mouths can be smelled all over the world. For some reason the US sets the standard for covid.

He can’t get out of bed and never goes anywhere. She’s vaccinated and wears a mask out. Still fears the virus. Throw 10 3/4” stones in a steel coffee can and shake it. That’s the discussion.</p>

        <p>I mean I understand how people stopped thinking freely with all this propaganda being thrown at their faces but  it's been 1 and a half years now and so much information has come out even some of the "conspiracies" have been admitted. How can people still believe this bs. And I've seen a lot about people changing their minds but apparently it's not enough. And it's seems like it's never going to be enough.</p>

<p>My organization did mention that they decided this in part from a joint statement from the American Academy of Physicians and ~50 other Healthcare organizations and societies. This is that statement.</p>
