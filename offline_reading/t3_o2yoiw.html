    <strong>Are you mentally prepared for showdown in autumn?</strong>
    <p><p>imagine wearing a mask while others are vaccinated.
imagine thinking a mask would help against a virus. </p>
<p>but yeah they wanna make you wear it all day, best if you dont change the mask at all and breathe in your dead stuck bacteria back into your lungs until you get an infection, that way you get scared you have covid, so you can go and take the jab. but hey wait, if you have beaten „corona“ you have natural antibodies.</p>
<p>oh snap! but there is the delta variant and the gamma and the zeta, kappa and the whole greek alphabet of variants! It would make a lot of sense to vaccinate against every letter in the greek alphabet! 
or maybe you just wont make it until then, the next vaccine will make sure you die quicker. </p>
<p>the new world can only be built with lesser people and it saves apparently the climate if most humans are gone.</p>
<p>Im also very disgusted by the fact how my local doctors are even that retarded. 
They even push people to get the jab, quick and without discussion. 
Because your can see their eyes turn into dollar signs and are rolling like a slot machine. The more they vaccinate the more dollars they get. 
And even before that, doctors were not even listening to a problem you have. 
its not in their interest to make you healthy.
Which is their god damn job.</p>
<p>All about the meds selling. Medicine is mostly there to reduce symptoms and to bypass. But as soon as you dont take them, for example you have blood pressure issues, the problem comes back.</p>
<p>So I dont understand that no doctor is actually discussing the REASON why something is happening. If you find the reason you can find a cure.
I cannot take fuckin pills all my life. And be depend on them unless this is the only way.</p>
<p>Like motivating to change food intake, sports and whatever would be a start.</p>
<p>The same mentality is now with vaccines.
They know it mutates all the time. Why bother vaccinating?
They just dont care as it brings dollars.</p>
<p>And if the patient gets sick, it brings even more dollars.
Thats our doctors. Theres just a small amount that truely cares that others are doing ok. I love those doctors that are proud and happy for what they have done to heal somebody.</p>
<p>But for autumn I expect at first a huge financial crisis, that will lead to massive unemployments. So dont bother getting a jab because you will lose your job anyway.
Those who took it already will probably start dying. 
Honestly Im not really prepared to watch that and be blamed for that.
Probably best to act incognito without a mask and start running when someone asks you for proof... bad times ahead</p></p>

        <p>Yes. I fully expect it. Leaves will change, rain will return, lockdowns will destroy more businesses... New normal.</p>

        <p>Honestly, if you were alive for the past 20 years, you already knew that big pharma had the medical community by the balls a long time ago. You already knew doctors would push the pill of the month and it hasn't really been about health for a long, long time. </p>
<p>It's really not that much of a stretch to see doctors just going for the money and pushing on their patients to get something that will get them paid. It's been going on a long time.</p>

        <p>This is why the riots were so heavily pushed in MSM during the trump administration. Yes more were happening but that’s the plan. We are too busy fighting with each other about all these smaller issues we can see what they are doing while we fight.  after all the protests it’s seems to be the norm now. No one bats an eye when they see a protest in the news. Divide and conquer. It really is a plan. lol I don’t understand how people can’t see that</p>

        <p>Agreed 100%</p>
<p>Also, just judging by your name/location, I pity you for possibly being in an even worse position than me.</p>

        <p>Okay this resonated with me at a high level...kind of freaky actually. I do believe the next terror attack (cyber pandemic) to be around 9/11 which will crumble the entire market. Then the SHTF door will be wide open...I hope I'm wrong.</p>
