    <strong>Some side effects of the vaccine that happened to ppl I know</strong>
    <p><p>I'm from Finland we people here just started getting Pfizer vaccines from the beginning of the year.  </p>
<p>My best friend got +39.3C fever for few days after the second dose. During that I told her that maybe she should contact a doctor about that fever where she replied "iT iS NoRmaL, iT MeaNS It iS WOrkINg!". Also heard that in my previous work place, 50%+ of the people got fever because of the vaccine and had to take few days off.  </p>
<p>I did some math and in Finland we have 5.500.000 people and 44.000 Covid cases since the beginning. That means you have 0.8% chance of getting Covid every year here with current rate. It is actually much less than 0.8% as lots of people are getting tested multiple times. When you count the number of asymptomatic cases, the chance of actually getting covid every year is maybe around 0.1% in here. Now, would I rather get +39C fever every year and lay down half-dead on bed or choose to get Covid with just 0.1% yearly chance?! I'll go with Covid.</p></p>

        <p>It's worse than that, it's pretty clear that if it can wipe out healthy young people for a few days, the effect will be far worse on the frail and elderly, ironically the same people covid is worse for. This whole thing is so fucking ridiculous.</p>

        <p>I just don't get the logic of people who take the vaccine. They voluntarily get injected with the same stuff they try so hard to avoid with masking etc. and "suffer" the same symptoms. It makes me laugh. The chance to catch it is not even that high, and the resulting immunity likely is stronger. Thanks, I'll take my chances. No-brainer for me.</p>
