    <strong>The hidden casualties of lockdowns...</strong>
    <p><p>I fortunately do not know anyone personally or even second degree who have died from corona yet.  I applied to a job recently and heard some depressing news from the people running the place.  A beloved team member commit suicide over the summer and that person also knew two other suicides that occurred during lockdown from his previous job.  Anyways, I think it's insane that this is still the footnote to non-stop media coverage urging people to get the vaccine, not to mention the increase in overdoses and deaths due to people avoiding medical care because of corona fear.</p>
<p><a href="https://voxeu.org/article/deaths-despair-and-incidence-excess-mortality-2020">This article</a> indicates that deaths of despair might be the real tragedy of 2020.  Not the half million official corona deaths that are claimed by the CDC. Deaths of despair are characterized by " drug overdose (including alcohol overdose), suicide, and alcoholic liver disease."</p>
<p>"Mortality in 2020 significantly exceeds what would have occurred if official COVID-19 deaths were combined with a normal number of deaths from other causes. The demographic and time patterns of the non-COVID-19 excess deaths (NCEDs) point to deaths of despair rather than an undercount of COVID-19 deaths."</p>
