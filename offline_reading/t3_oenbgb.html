    <strong>Quick question</strong>
    <p><p>I was wondering how many folks here consider themselves readers, people who like to read.</p>
<p>As a gereral rule, I think that people who think for themselves tend to be readers, i don't have any sort of proof, just a theory.</p>
<p>I am a reader, my wife is not. She couldn't wait to get jabbed, I don't want it. She is a TV addict, the second she is awake the TV comes on. I could get rid of both of the TV's and I would never miss them.</p>
<p>I have a 12' x12' room, floor to ceiling bookcases along three walls and two 5 foot bookcases back to back in the center. Probably about 85% full, I have read about 80% of them. I don't have many novels. Most of the books I have tell me about something.</p>
<p>I am all over the net, mostly forums, except for social media, and games. Reminds me of a joke:</p>
<p>Did you hear YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook are merging. They are going to call the new company; Youtwitface.</p>
<p>She does solitaire, and fakebook. She believes The MSM, me not so much.
I was thinking about the differences and I was wondering if reading was involved.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>As a lifelong learner and thirst for knowledge, it is only natural for me to look up all things that interest me, or I want to learn about, or explore. I don't passively watch a show or movie and let words or ideas fly by, I look them up.. So there is a lot of reading involved, but maybe the side effect also is your inquisitive nature.. what's on the next page, where does this trail lead to..</p>

        <p>Well, I read your post :) so there's that.</p>
<p>I read many(8+) hours a day, but predominantly R&amp;D stuff, it's my job and my hobby, you gotta love what you do!  Also some comedy(reddit) and the likes.  And what is this TV thing you speak of, I'll have to look around and see if I have one.  My wife does, but it is only on like 8 hours a day, otherwise we play music.</p>
<p>No I won't be taking any experimental drugs this year, or next...</p>

        <p>I am talking about the substitutions that can seamlessly be generated in text shown across any application from ebooks to email clients to comments on Reddit. Typically in these cases the 'hook' that loads first on screen is replaced by the actual text within a few seconds. And it's formulated by language processing AI to snare your attention.</p>

<p>However. We don't have normal TV... Raises the Jolly Roger. So no news, no commercials.</p>

        <p>I listen to audiobooks all day at work and read books when I get home. I simply can’t get enough. I can trace the slacking of my attention span to my first smart device and I honestly believe literacy and literature will be doomed if modern civilization follows its current path. At least among the general populous, the drive to search for the grail, and for secret teachings of prehistory is disappearing. Antiquated perspectives, however illumined are dismissed entirely simply because they are deemed archaic and ignoble. I don’t understand how anyone can believe that our species is in a state of evolution right now when all I see (especially when contrasted against the ingenuity of ancient writers and philosophers) is devolution towards complacency and weakness of mind, body and spirit. </p>
<p>Would love to know some of your (or anyone in the comment section’s) favorite reads!</p>
<p>I am reading Longfellow’s translation of Dante’s Inferno right now, and listening to The Secret Teachings of All Ages by Manly P. Hall (highly recommended).
I also recommend Twelve Tribe Nations by John Michell and Christine Rhone. It’s an entrancing read for those interested in divine mathematics, the search for the grail, and dissection of symbolism in ancient allegories. </p>
<p>Keep turning pages!</p>
