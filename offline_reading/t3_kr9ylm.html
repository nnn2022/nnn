        <p>I 100% agree with the majority of the points that were brought up, think of it this way... if we were in a real pandemic, you wouldn't have to drive fear into people and convince them to stay home.... hell I'd hide under my fucking bed if ebola was outside!</p>

        <p>Just don't stack them near a water source and you'll be fine. Also, boil the water for five minutes if you aren't sure what was dumped in the water source previously.</p>

        <p>This virus is different than ones we have seen in the past. People experience it in different ways, some not all. This is why it is treated differently. Alot of people have also stopped attempting to be for the lack of a better word, good. </p>
<p>I'm going to try and not get political because this should not be a political issue but here is an example of why things are being handled this way. My wife's father is one of the "covid is a lie"  people in the family. He does not take precautions, goes out to eat, and when forced to wear masks keeps his nose out. We have tried our best to avoid him and his immediate family since March. Unfortunately someone invited him to our 5 person Christmas dinner, no mask. That next morning, his girlfriend was brought to the hospital because she thought she was having a heart attack. It was covid. Four days later I went to the ER at 2 a.m. because I was pissing straight blood. Something is up with my kidneys, I test positive. Goodbye $2000 deductible on new years eve after avoiding dr's all year. 2 days later I am sick with flu like symptoms and have lost my entire sense of smell and taste, maybe forever. My wife's mother is sick and having trouble to breath. My wife and her sister just feel like they have a cold. Our heart rates are all soaring and we all test positive. Her father was just rushed to the hospital 2 days ago and is on a breathing machine.</p>
<p>All the while my niece, who was at dinner, is staying at her father's house with no symptoms. They are annoyed covid deniers. Instead of quarantining, they have been going shopping, visiting friends, and going out to eat. Guess who just entered the ER? Her grandmother. Their whole household is positive. Their co-workers are probably as well. </p>
<p>This is the reason things are the way they are. People are not looking out for each other out of their own free will.</p>

        <p>HIV was, and is, a real pandemic. Most people who were alive in the 80s know of someone who was affected in some way. I know of one confirmed corona death. I know of many, many more suicides related to lockdown.</p>

        <p>I don’t think the coronavirus is fake, I just think it’s been overdone. Look at who profited from the pandemic, the small business closed and the bigger ones survived. The rich got trillions while people got $1,800</p>
