    <strong>What concerns do you have with the new COVID-19 vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>I have the option to get vaccinated soon and for me, the risks of the vaccine out weigh the benefits of not getting it. I don‚Äôt agree with forcing a vaccine upon people and I respect peoples decisions to not get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Would you get the vaccine if you could? Why/why not?</p></p>

        <p>I would say at this point with all of the anecdotal stories of people developing bels palsey (sp?), some people developing serious tremors, and others experiencing a huge drop/rise in T cells; I‚Äôm gonna say I don‚Äôt want to get it. Especially when the chances of dying from Covid is so low. I know it‚Äôs highly unlikely that it will happen to me, but I don‚Äôt want to risk it. And personally I think the ‚Äòexperimental vaccine‚Äô came out a little too fast for comfort. I‚Äôm all for vaccinations for things like polio, mumps, etc. but this one rubs me the wrong way.</p>

        <p>Yeah, those are good points. I feel like my good immune system plus young age make it nearly impossible to get any serious effects if I get sick. I guess the only reason I am leaning toward getting the shot is getting rid of the guilt and anxiety of spreading it to other people I am close to. I just feel like it will make life easier if I can tell people I have the vaccine. This shit sucks</p>

        <p>But it doesnt stop transmission AND you have to continue to wear a mask, AND social distance, AND it only lasts for a few months.</p>
<p>You shouldnt feel guilt and anxiety but I understand why you do. The media has battered it into your head since march last year..... you see it when you go to the shops, the lines of people, all masked up....</p>
<p>Even if u did get 'it' then passed it to someone  unless they are very old or very unwell, theyll be fine.</p>
<p>I also think that your feeling of making life easier is another media thing. No one has actually said you have to get it but there is so much propaganda in the media about how amazing this thing is...even though quite a few people (including some healthy) have died since having it.</p>
<p>But 'you will have to get it to work' ' you will have to get It to fly'. You imagine what these companies will be like when the majority of the world tells them to jog on? Theyll sharp turn 180.</p>
<p>But I appreciate thehonesty of your post. However you should do what is best for YOU. you are NOT selfish for thinking like that. As above this 'vaccine' does not guarantee that you are protecting other people. Only lessening effects for yourself</p>
<p>Either way, take care bud</p>

        <p>Do you know that people died even in the clinical trials and they tried to play the deaths off as non-related? The same with Bell's Palsy. If anyone should feel guilt it is the media and the vaccine pusher, the people that are using this virus to strip away our rights, to control us. People are being manipulated. </p>
<p>And, yes, you can still have to social distance and wear face masks after all is said and done. </p>
<p>People have painted me as a looney conservative Christian (I'm most definitely none of those, well, maybe the looney part ;) for even thinking twice about getting the vaccine. I think the those that are listening to the media and those lining up like good üêë for vaccines without thinking twice are the real loonies. The ones that aren't looking at the bigger picture and seeing they are being manipulated. </p>
<p>I'm not trying to persuade you one way or the other, but you should not feel any guilt if you choose not to get the üíâ. There are doctors and nurses refusing to give the vaccine. Why is that?</p>

        <p>Even if the vaccines were safe, I wouldn't be interested because I simply don't need it. If I had Covid, I would get better with no major issues.</p>
<p>And the fact that all of them have <strong>only</strong> been given the emergency use authorisation bothers me, because it means they didn't go through the regular process of evaluation.</p>
<p>By the way, it is nice to see an outsider being polite for once.</p>

        <p>Haha thanks, I wanted to get some opinions on this topic from people in a sub that isn‚Äôt so bias and hive minded on jerking this vaccine off. I‚Äôm no fan of putting things into my body that I don‚Äôt need to. I think the biggest draw to me getting it is just knowing I‚Äôm much less likely to spread it to loved ones, and maybe being able to tell people I have the vaccine will make life feel a little back to normal.</p>

        <p>I have gotten my first dose.  Only a sore arm.  I got the Pfizer vaccine.  I‚Äôm getting the 2nd one on the 26th.  And I can let you know afterwards if I felt crappy after the 2nd one.  I‚Äôve seen a few people feel crappy for a day or two.  I totally agree that vaccination should be a personal decision and not mandatory.  Talk of mandatory vaccination is really making me angry that is totally wrong.</p>

        <p>I had crippling respiratory failure as a child.  If covid was going to get me, it would have already.  I had a not so great reaction to the HPV vaccine, so absolutely not.  And if anyone tries to force it on me. I will go out in a firefight over it.</p>

        <p>Its an experiment technology. It‚Äôs not worth it. </p>
<p>It only reduces symptoms from something that may not exist. ( not isolated ) </p>
<p>The risks are unknown.</p>

        <p>Lemme just say that if Covid had like an 8% mortality rate I‚Äôd probably roll the dice on a vaccine like this. I like living. </p>
<p>That said, it doesn‚Äôt and currently you probably have a higher chance of dying from the vaccine than fighting it off conventionally. </p>
<p>I especially do not agree with how the elderly in hospice are being administered these injections first. They‚Äôre testing this shit on unwittingly on people who already probably have a whole host of issues anyway. </p>
<p>Then there‚Äôs the rampant virtue signaling that comes after you get the vaccine. Like congrats dude, you‚Äôre now a guinea pig for something that likely isn‚Äôt even much of a threat in the long term anyway.</p>

        <p>Absolutely not. After what happened to my skin, twice, within weeks of getting a flu shot in 2016 &amp; 2018 I will not. I'll lose my job over it. </p>
<p>I'm not sure if my skin was related to the flu shot but my PCP &amp; dermatologist wrote me a medical exemption.</p>

        <p>Many people will say they don't want it, but I fear what happens when people who are financially struggling are offered money to get it. Dollar General is paying their employees 4 hours worth of salary to get it. That's about $32 (before taxes that is).</p>
