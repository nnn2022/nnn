    <strong>The difference between “Trust The Science™️” and actual science.</strong>
    <p><p><em>Trust the science</em> is all about blind obedience. Questioning is heavily discouraged and you are simply asked for your <em>trust</em>. Let’s not cheapen everything, trust is important. They’re asking for a lot here, don’t you think? </p>
<p>You are instructed to blindly believe faceless individuals. It’s always “health experts said”....conjuring images of shadowy figures in lab coats. Their names and professional ties, hidden. So if a “health expert” receives funding from Company X and tells us that we should buy more of Product A because it’s healthy (which is, incidentally, a product that Company X sells)....then that’s Trust The Science™️. </p>
<p><em>Trust the science</em> is about giving someone else remote control of your brain. You can kick back and relax while someone else tells you how to live your life, how many masks to wear, what vaccine to get, if you should see your family. This approach is the easiest and least painful route. Blind obedience feels good and familiar which is why so many people do it. </p>
<p>(I read a comment on another subreddit where a person stated that they were terrified of getting the vaccine due to their severe allergies. They said they were hoping not to die but still decided to go ahead with the appointment. <strong>This person was more terrified of a flu, and being seen as a conspiracy theorist/anti-vaxxer, than death</strong>. This is a prime example of Trust The Science™️: <em>blind belief even if it kills you</em>.) </p>
<p><em>Trust the science</em> is about one own’s ego too. It seems that a lot of people think that by using worthless slogans such as Trust The Science™️ it makes them appear smart. They believe that it reflects on their own level of intelligence. It’s implied that they surely have done a lot of independent research and read peer reviewed articles which is they <em>decided</em> to trust the science, right? The truth is that in almost all cases, these people have merely read a headline or listened to a celebrity. They simply parrot what they hear from those they feel inferior to. </p>
<p>In short: Trust The Science™️ is a cult. </p>
<p>Actual science is none of the above. It asks questions and seeks to find answers. Questioning is encouraged; in fact science is all about questioning. Silencing this act is inherently anti-science. It should not be blasphemous and/or scandalous to point out inconsistencies and irregularities when “health experts” make bold claims, further studies should be conducted. </p>
<p>Ultimately, I can trust the scientific method but there’s little use in trusting faceless people who don’t care about me or my health. Know the difference between the two.</p></p>

        <p>What's even more important, science can not produce any imperative statements. It is completely and by definition conditional. It can only tell that if we take this bunch of factors in consideration (and with necessity ruling out other factors), then this will be the outcome. Any and all the imperatives come from outside of the scientific way of thought and are political in nature. Even plausible and beneficial ones. So all the attempts to reduce the situation to just a subject of scientific investigation are misleading and straightforward wrong.</p>

        <p>Yup.</p>
<p>Politically motivated and funded research is not in any way the same as objective scientific research. Most seem to recognize that politics are playing a role in the covid pandemic and reactions to it, yet they choose to deny that the science has been changed to fit political agendas. However, there are clear instances of this happening, whether the changes are for profit or to save one’s career is what we cannot know. Believing these overnight 180s in scientific outcomes, and ignoring the role politics play, is akin to biologists saying Creationism is suddenly proven over evolution, right after mass Young Earth Creationist funding, and people just accepting it as true!  </p>
<p>The best example is the very NEJM article I have been referencing, one of the most reputable sources. In July 2020 the authors made this statement: </p>
<p>&rt;"We understand that some people are citing our Perspective article (published on April 1 at NEJM.org) as support for discrediting widespread masking. <strong>In truth, the intent of our article was to push for more masking, not less.</strong>"  </p>
<p>But what were the actual findings regarding masks OUTSIDE a health care facility?  </p>
<p>&rt;"We know that <strong>wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection</strong> from infection... The <strong>chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal.</strong> In many cases, the <strong>desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic</strong>... Focusing on universal <strong>masking alone may, paradoxically, lead to more transmission of Covid-19 if it diverts attention from implementing more fundamental infection-control measures</strong>... It is also clear that <strong>masks serve symbolic roles.</strong> Masks are not only tools, <strong>they are also talismans that may help increase health care workers’ perceived sense of safety, well-being, and trust in their hospitals</strong>. Although <strong>such reactions may not be strictly logical</strong>, we are all subject to fear and anxiety, especially during times of crisis. One might argue that <strong>fear and anxiety are better countered with data and education than with a marginally beneficial mask, particularly in light of the worldwide mask shortage, but it is difficult to get clinicians to hear this message in the heat of the current crisis....."</strong></p>
<p>Does this sound like a push for masking outside of health care facilities? Or even really in them aside from their symbolism? This is nothing but a blatant contradiction of their findings to save their careers in our cancel culture.  </p>
<p>Another example of this horror is an article on why facemasks don't work by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC. He concluded:  </p>
<p>&rt;"Literature reviews have confirmed that <strong>wearing a mask during surgery has no impact whatsoever on wound infection rates during clean surgery... No matter how well a mask conforms to the shape of a person’s face, it is not designed to create an air tight seal around the face... a study of eight brands of face masks found that they did not filter out 20-100% of particles</strong> ... etc."  </p>
<p>Yet if you don't have an archived link, here is what you now see:  </p>
<p>&rt;"If you are looking for “Why Face Masks Don’t Work: A Revealing Review” by John Hardie, BDS, MSc, PhD, FRCDC, <strong>it has been removed. The content was published in 2016 and is no longer relevant in our current climate.</strong>"  </p>
<p>Our "current climate" is one that prefers fear over fact, control over science and reason, submission over freedom</p>
