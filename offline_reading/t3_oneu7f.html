        <p>These vaccines are clearly the endgame of COVID. The real purpose of lockdowns and masks was clearly to get us to take the vaccines.</p>
<p>Now, what is the purpose of the vaccines? I really have no idea. All I know for sure is that the purpose of the vaccines isn't to prevent COVID.</p>

        <p>You got it.</p>
<p>One thing keeps needling at me, why isn't anyone questioning the low quality of the vaxxes, aka no immunity or stopping of transmission, they are nothing like traditional vaccines, that did stop an illness. Us unvaxxed should even be supposedly "protected" from getting Covid should we be hanging out with the vaxxed and vice versa but we are not. The vaxxes are definitely being used for something else. I believe it's basically genocide, infertility, markers, possibly something to do with graphene, etc, but who knows. We do know they will be altering the human genome. That is a problem alone. Yes this whole mess was about the vaxxes not Covid at all.</p>

        <p>I wrote this about our professional class....</p>
<p>" think of how the professional class, has become a threat to us all especially those in the lower classes, the endless vetting, licensure, and demands for conformity, have put the worse people in "charge" in many cases. It also moved up the narcissists, the greedy, and those with no consciences or integrity. The experts are evil and stupid, now lets just call it as it is. I believe even most of the "science" has reduced in quality. One thing I have noticed is no one has discussed the quality of the vaxxes and how they are far poorer even compared to traditional standards of classic vaccines, but hey when you do research according to what the corporation wants you to get for results, what do you expect. They are often phony people who focus more on wearing the right clothing and "fitting in". Try hanging out with some academics. I have noticed in the old days, some professor could be rumpled and absent minded, maybe a little overweight but now, you better be good looking to get "the good job". The professional class as we have it now are the poorest quality people on multiple levels. This doesn't mean all professionals are bad, but many are, and that's a problem. Ever notice how all the independent thinkers are weeded out of these places now?"</p>

        <p>Elite, globalist Liberals are part of the problem, no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Take a look at Justin Trudeau.  He doesn't understand the myriad negative effects of a national lockdown, because he lives in opulence.</p>
<p>Most of these "liberals" live in their home, are still collecting a paycheck, and probably welcomed the lockdowns because it meant more time to stay home and watch Netflix.</p>
<p>The people who supported the lockdown, and now the vaccine, are the most selfish people on the planet.  </p>
<p>Except they are so full of themselves, they don't even realize it.  It's sad to watch.</p>

        <p>You got it, and it's not just the ultra wealthy 1 percent or politician class, but I would say the general upper middle class and above too, that rose above all the lock-downs. It's interesting to me how they TRUST in the system so implicitly. Those types may not be getting the saline or fake shots of the ultra wealthy, but be suffering for their lack of critical thinking.  I agree they are the most selfish people on the planet. They don't care about what has been done to other people's lives.</p>
