    <strong>What countries do not require negative Covid tests to enter?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm considering moving somewhere where you can see people's face (crazy, I know) and where they're not controlled by fear, media, and state propaganda to the point of ruining their communities. </p>
<p>One might <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3ANational_Anthem_of_Eritrea_by_US_Navy_Band.ogg">listen to the national anthem of Eritrea</a>, and then ponder the historical relevance of those musical instruments to rural Africa... </p>
<p>How did the entire globe almost instantaneously become controlled as if it is ruled by one faction? This is only logically possible if behavior is constrained to hierarchical control (e.g. everyone is just "doing their job" and some superior "above them" told them to do what they are doing). Texas says they are maskless, and now the subordinate subset follows suit: "yay, we're maskless!" Should I hop on one foot next? </p>
<p>This passive program of obedience is contingent on compliance. How can one consider the vast evidence of mistreatment and abuses of power in government, and believe any of this?</p>
<p>It's becoming a dystopia that uniquely doesn't even perceive that it is one. </p>
<p>Even if suddenly the masks disappear and people are told they can feel safe again, I still have to contend with knowing that a large portion of my peers were turned into media-owned robots. It's like crossing a threshold or rubicon of no-return. Even if society drops the epidemic pretense, who wants to build community with people who are so easily socially engineered?</p></p>

        <p>" How did the entire globe almost instantaneously become controlled as if it is ruled by one faction?" EXACTLY! That's what I have been wondering about. It looks like we already have a one-world government. I would also like to know of some spot on earth which is sane and independent.</p>

        <p>All governmental processes (biological nervous systems, computer architecture, and human social grouping) function according to hierarchical power flows. Systemic orchestration is only possible because of compliance (forced or voluntary) with instruction sets (predicated on punishment [pain in the CNS, or criminality in the society] and reward models [dopamine in the CNS, and governmental paychecks in the society]).</p>
<p>It's fractal.</p>

        <p>This may sound stupid, but hear me out, I think some people were media-owned robots before. For example, the whole super straight thing. I never really look at news, but I did look at the news for this, and I saw the news saying “superstraight is transphobic” in every, single, damn headline. Then you would see the people saying THE EXACT SAME THING WITH THE EXACT SAME ARGUMENTS. It was creepy, every single person I talked to said it was transphobic, same exact thing the media had said first.</p>
<p>You had the marvel fanboys. They were loyal media bots in a way. And of course big corporations would endorse the message as well, ex Disney</p>

        <p>Well, technically, if you're living in the EU, you can travel between member states as you please. Even if they'll decide to check papers or whatever on the official border crossing, nothing is stopping you from just walking around the checkpoint. Legally speaking, that is</p>

        <p>Belarus. I'm there currently, there are 0 restrictions and masks are optional. It's life as it was in 2019 + you can wear a mask if you want but it's also fine not to wear any at the supermarket, subway, etc...</p>

        <p>No, it's always been like this. However, the difference with western Europe is that in Belarus if you keep quiet about the government you can live a totally normal life.</p>
<p>Here in the EU you get jailed "for your safety" for one year even when you have said nothing, and who knows how long lockdowns will last. At this point I'd rather live in Belarus, at least I can go to the restaurant and have some gin and tonics in a bar after.</p>
