    <strong>An open letter</strong>
    <p><p>An open letter
To anyone who will listen.</p>
<p>I have never said that I dont belive that it isnt real, however it has been blown way out of proportion. It has been over hyped as this super deadly virus but the truth it is has a 99.97% survival rate, smoking has killed more people. To look at that rate and say "lets shut down the economy, ruin peoples lives, give up our freedoms, and fuck over the childern" is just pure insanity.
Youve been so brainwashed by the media to belive everything they say. Wear a mask, stay away from loved ones, shut down youre small business and resturants, but shop no problem at the big box stores. 
Never mind that masks are shown to stop maybe 2% of droplets, basicaly saying that they dont work, a rushed cdc study with manniquins is not valid. It should also be ones choice, as bad as it may sound, YOUR HEALH IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY!!!!!!!!! as mine is not yours, if I felt at risk I would take the precautions to protect myself, I wouldnt except you to stay home and give up any semblence of life youve had on the super slim chance that youd make me sick. If youre scared, stay home. This isnt living this is hiding in fear of something you cant even control, and majority are not at risk, even those at risk tend to pull thorugh, EX 116 year old nun in France recovered, hell she didnt even know she had it. 
Why are we throwing away our freedoms, YES THEY ARE IMPORTNT, for this? It dose not make sense, there is obviously something nefarious going on in the background, something ,along the lines of the great reset, look it up, it real. Do you honestly think that the government has our best intrests in mind? When have they ever show to do that? You think that theyll give their power up so eaisly? As the saying goes "why let a good crisis go to waste"
And the childern, what are we doing to the childern!? This is 100% child abuse, its not just a cloth, its not just a year at home, it is 100% detremental to their health, if you think that sacrificing the young to protect the old is a proper mindset, you should get your mind stright. My childern are all that matter to me, their futures are not up for debate! And dont try to argue, its not ok, your child may be "fine" but truth is they are loosing a bit of themselves everyday. How many have to miss out on major life milstones of their young lives? Already has one year of proms and graduations have been taken away, do you feel ok with this? There is no benift! Have you stopped to think what this is all doing, in what world is the cure worst than the virus!? Have you lost the ability to think critically? Will you only listen to the paid voicebox on tv? 
If this "pandemic" is so deadly, tell me, where are the bodies? Shouldnt people be falling in the streets? Shouldnt there be a mass grave in every city? What about the homeless? Shouldnt there be corpses everywhere? 
And why if its so deadly, do we need 24/7 advertising campaign? If you turned off the TV and and stayed off socail media would you know anything different? Dont you think that money could better be put to use elsewhere?
The PCR tests have a reputation of false positives, they set the cycle too high then for whats needed. The hospitals arent full, if they were why have nursing staff and hours been cut back? Where are the ambulances? Was this all worth it for missed "non essistal" cancer and heart surgeries? Turning people away from the ER with a advil and a covid test even tho they have a dangerous feaver and went in to get it treatred?  Dose this sound like proper health care?
And the meantal health crisis? Is it really worth  it? Are childern killing themselves just a loss to the greater good?And yes they are killing themselves! If we can save just one 95 year old its worth it? I thought the childern were the future. And i know its not just them suffering, personally, my stresss levels are high, I am scared (and not of any "covid"), I am anxious, depressed, the amount of despair i feel is heavy, someday i dont want to go on. This is what you are allowing to happen not just to me, all in the name of safety. Youre delisiounal, you make me want to blow my brains out. 
And the vaccine, if you support a vaccine passport, I am sorry we can not be friends. In what world do you think its allright to force someone to take something untested into their bodies? Alot of people seem to be under the impression that it has been tested and FDA approved IT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED AND FDA APPROVED!!!! they have been given emergency use, youre the phase 3 trail, if you want to take the chance thats all you,, that is your right to do so, as it is my right to refuse. If you choose to do so, please just be informed, do youre reserch, if youre under 65, youre not at much risk, the vaccine may be a bigger risk to youre health, and dont just listen to youre TV look it up for yourself!
Take a hard look at history, it didnt start with the camps, it started slow and quiet, turning one group against another. Dont fail the childern.
"So, this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause"
"Those who forget history, are doomed to repeat it"
The following is links and sources, please look beyond the media:
"Findings included 61 studies (74 estimates) and eight preliminary national estimates. Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.02% to 53.40%. Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 1.63%, corrected values from 0.00% to 1.54%. Across 51 locations, the median COVID-19 infection fatality rate was 0.27% (corrected 0.23%): the rate was 0.09% in locations with COVID-19 population mortality rates less than the global average (&lt;118 deaths/million), 0.20% in locations with 118â€“500 COVID-19 deaths/million people and 0.57% in locations with &rt;500 COVID-19 deaths/million people. In people younger than 70 years, infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 0.31% with crude and corrected medians of 0.05%"</p>

        <p>"there is obviously something nefarious going on in the background". Of course there is, it's been going on for a long time. Many people have spoken out either with first hand knowledge or truth seekers that are aware of the veil in front of them. These people have been dismissed for a long time. These people have been called uneducated, crazy, conspiracy theorists, and the list goes on and on. The amount of "conspiracy theories" as people put it, that have been proven as true conspiracies is shocking and extremely eye opening. People have shouted warnings from the top of mountains trying to wake others up to reality. All to little avail. I myself have come to the realization that people are like caterpillars. You cannot force them to begin their transformation. It comes in time. The question here is, will the mass population of willfully ignorant individuals be the down fall of the rest of us? The movie The Matrix is an extremely accurate in the connection of the people unknowingly living in the matrix and Agent Smith. The people in the matrix are used against those who question/fight their reality/control system. This is very similar to the world we live in today. Furthermore people are willingly trading freedom and liberty for convenience and false sense of safety. 
Now before you start to sing the doom song. We must remember diamonds need pressure to form. There are countless examples in human history where a new problem must be presented before a new solution is brought into existence. The number of people that have started to peel around the veil has drastically increased since 2010. It comes down to how much pressure must applied. When is enough really enough. For people like you and I that was a year ago if not before that. For others it may be the day or hour before everything is taken from them. Stay positive. It is but a ride friend, and there is no making it out alive. I'll see you on the other side.</p>
