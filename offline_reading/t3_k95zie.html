    <strong>We destroyed the world for 0.03%</strong>
    <p><p>0.03% is the amount of the population who have died (in Canada at least) WITH Covid. And that's on the high end, assuming the deaths were properly attributed.</p>
<p>I don't understand as much about viruses as experts in health but I do understand proportionate risk and when I look at that number it makes my head explode. What a small risk to destroy peoples live over, it makes sick to my stomach just thinking about it.</p></p>

        <p>If you did a little, with DuckDuckGo, you'll find scientists and doctors who are against all of this. They just get ignored and canceled. My head explosion day was finding that plus data from the 'officials' that 99% survive, plus the tests not even being able to detect a live virus.</p>

        <p>This is what I keep saying. The covid response is truly a massive psycho break from decades of established science, logic, and common sense. What happened and why did this happen? The WHO, CDC, and all the "experts"  now completely play dumb and act like they don't know or forgot things that were just basic knowledge to them less than a year ago. Everything concerning this virus is such a massive break from all protocol and sanity. So you have to ask what is <em>really</em> going here? Did they all have lobotomies in March? Is this invasion of the body snatchers? Are we dead and in a collective hell hence nothing makes sense because it's meant to be torment? Or...is something very nefarious is going on...as in the powers that be know exactly what they're doing? Why else would they deliberately silence and censor the experts who dared go against the narrative? Why else would they obscure all truth and blatantly lie?</p>

        <p>I’d have to go search for it, but it was a combination of China fucking us all over and the WHO being in China’s pocket. I saw somebody post it the other day.</p>
<p>China originally covered this up at a local level, then a national level, and went to insane, authoritarian extents to do so. Was some of it propaganda? At this point.. maybe? They for sure lied about it being transmitted by humans, and the WHO bought their lies. Then they lied that they beat this thing.</p>
<p>The WHO then agreed China did beat it, containment is the right strategy, then sent Chinese authorities to Italy to assist them and the answer was “lockdown HARDER!” After that the first dominos fell and we were all fucked.</p>

        <p>Chin lied about everything. They lied about the severity of the virus, they lied about the measures they took, they lied about controlling/eradicating it, and they lied about the numbers. Anyone who actually believes the absurd numbers they put out us a complete moron. You can bet that China had millions of infections, and their real number of deaths isn't the bullshit number they gave, but is the same as it would be for any bad flu season (which would be the case in the US as well, but the US did the complete opposite of China...rather than reporting almost no cases and deaths, they test everyone and their dog here, and the number of deaths is highly inflated).</p>

        <p>It’s also alarming that they expect us to believe them when it comes from the wet market but there’s no proof in the genome that it came from a pangolin. Seems they’d be eager to prove that, no?</p>
<p>I don’t know if it accidentally escaped from a lab but they won’t even allow anyone in to check it out.</p>

        <p>What happened is this.</p>
<p>The United States had zero leadership at the federal level at the start of the outbreak.  </p>
<p>States were blindsided and forced to deal with it individually.  </p>
<p>That would be fine if states had firm borders and the ability to close them, but they dont.</p>
<p>So on one hand you had a president who called everything a hoax, and states who then were left on their own to deal with it.</p>
<p>This is why, if we are one country, we must have proper intelligent leadership at the top, not a reality tv star.</p>

        <p>Yes, federal mandates.  Execution of the production act to produce n95 masks for everyone, not just cloth.</p>
<p>Federal guidelines and at the very least an unmuffled cdc.</p>
<p>The president has the authority to envoke the national productions act, forcing any manufacturer to produce a certain item.  EVERY factory in the country should have been forced to produce ppe.</p>
<p>Trump nothing.</p>
<p>Do i think hillary would have handled it better?  In my opinion it would have been caught a lot earlier and we would have never even heard of it.</p>
<p>We had cdc teams in china in wuhan.   Trump removed them.  With them gone the virus was able to spread undetected for months.</p>
<p>https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21C3N5</p>
<p>At the VERY LEAST, hillary wouldnt have cut our eyes in china.</p>
<p>This has entirely mishandled from day 1.  This is trumps pandemic.  The world relied on the US and the CDC to prevent these types of outbreaks.   Under his leadership he failed the entire world.</p>

        <p>&rt;to trust the experts but I think that's a red herring argument.</p>
<p>I think it's called appeal to "authority", and it's frankly complete garbage.</p>

<p>&rt;Where are the experts in risk management, economics and mental health in all this?</p>
<p>That's a good point, it's always the "experts" in creating the most catastrophic predictions that are shown, and of course that is expected as it obviously simply all is a pretense to induce north-korean fascism levels to the rest of the world.</p>

        <p>And these fools can't even speak properly and say stupid shit like "We have to lockdown because of pandemic, we're all adapting to the new normal in covid time." Who actually talks like this? And the MSM propagandists are worse saying "You can't shake hands during a pandemic, because of covid time pandemic." </p>
<p>Its almost like Newspeak, listen carefully they constantly say "during a pandemic" when they refer to certain actions, as if this is something that's happened before and will continue to happen, all part of this fucked up "New Normal". </p>

        <p>How exactly is it non-specific?</p>
<p>That thing about "The guy who fell off his roof was a CoVid-19 death!" has been debunked because he had CoVid-19, it had damaged his lungs, and that is what made him pass out and fall off the roof, breaking his neck.</p>
<p>Same thing for the motorcyclist who was counted as a CoVid-19 death, doctors did an autopsy, they found lung damage, realized he most likely passed out at the motorcycle handle, and that is why the accident happened that killed him.</p>
<p>Some deaths are going too far down counting them as CoVid-19 deaths I am sure but the most publicized ones there was a good reasoning for counting them as CoVid-19 deaths.</p>

        <p>It depends on the state but many states aren’t doing their due diligence. The easiest thing for them to do is just call it covid and be done with it. Exceedingly few of these patients are getting autopsies to prove that covid 19 played a role. </p>
<p>Many deaths that have occurred in nursing homes for instance, the patient will die from bacterial pneumonia, but the patient is never tested. Then they get labeled a “probable covid death” under the cdc guidelines, which doesn’t require a positive test. </p>
<p>On the flip side anyone with a positive PCR test within 30 days who dies gets labeled a covid death. </p>
<p>Other countries aren’t doing it this way- you need to at least have symptoms consistent with the disease, not just a positive test. This is the way “cases” have been tracked for a hundred years.</p>

        <p>Oh aren't you special, you even capitalize the V in Covid like you're a professional, you're full of shit, there's numerous cases of heart attacks being counted as covid deaths, and like I said regardless, its 0.1% of the population with your made up numbers, this is a non-issue, it isn't a crisis, its nothing, I'm not a covid-denier, you're a reality denier, you want Totalitarianism, and the State having absolute authority in the name of the so-called "public good", people like you are actually mad when you're not forced to do something by the government.</p>

        <p>Yes I agree totally! People are losing it out in public too.  Screaming n running from people that aren't wearing a mask.   Calling the "Gestapo" on people for Thanksgiving gatherings and snickering.  It almost seems as if some people either follow the government blindly cause they are dumb or if they just don't want to "ask" anything and stay in their bubble</p>

<p>" The bonds will be issued under IBRD’s “capital at risk” program because investors bear the risk of losing part or all of their investment in the bond if an epidemic event triggers pay-outs to eligible countries covered under the PEF.</p>
<p>The PEF covers six viruses that are most likely to cause a pandemic. These include new Orthomyxoviruses (new influenza pandemic virus A), Coronaviridae (SARS, MERS), Filoviridae (Ebola, Marburg) and other zoonotic diseases (Crimean Congo, Rift Valley, Lassa fever)."  </p>
<p>This is literally all you have to know about why. While the public panics, its business as usual on top. These fuckers are ahead of everything. Fascinating.   </p>
