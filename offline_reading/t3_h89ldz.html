    <strong>I’m in the job market, I want to GO to work to learn a new job.</strong>
    <p><p>The greedy selfish wfh people do not remember when they started out. Someone showed them things, in person. Being in an office spreads KNOWLEDGE. I lost my small business to the lockdowns. I’m 50. I want to take a bus and go to work. How would I learn sitting in my kitchen?</p></p>

        <p>I’m 23 and I just graduated with my software degree. Like you, I want to GO to work, I want the experience, but too many companies are only offering remote positions. One job I applied for and <em>was</em> actually going to get I got fucked out of because the company lost too much funding from the lockdown mess.</p>
<p>Honestly I don’t know what the hell I'm gonna do at this point. Even remote positions are going to be difficult to get. I just want companies to finally grow some balls and open up. And when I mean “open up” I do not mean with all this “limitations”, “partial capacity”, or “opening phases” BS, but actually open up and stop worrying about doomers suing them so we can actually get people to work and my generation can actually get our lives started.</p>

        <p>Totally understand. I have been a teacher for 12 years and then a stay at home mom for the last 5. During that time I finished my degree in school counseling. 
I was contacted by some friends about a half time counseling position in a school by my house. I am excited about it and think it would be perfect to go back half time since my kids are still young. </p>
<p>The district just announced (a day after I applied to the position) that they are expecting to begin online only or a blended model in the fall. This means that during my first year as a counselor (if I get the position) I would be learning on the fly without almost any in person help. It sounds very overwhelming and I miss people (hence why I work with kids in a school setting).  Not the best time to go back but a great opportunity that should go well past all this stuff. Makes it a hard choice.</p>

        <p>I'm definitely not wanting some new normal and I think somebody ought to be able to go to work to learn their job if they want to. However, I'm in the tech industry and would have no problem learning a new job virtually. These days with zoom and other screen sharing software, if you are doing any type of work on computers, then you can definitely learn virtually. Why would you have to be there because it's basically the same thing in my opinion when somebody shares their screen with you versus looking over their shoulder at their desk</p>
