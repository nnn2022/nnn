        <p>&rt;why so many don't want to, and how exactly does it infringe on your rights.   </p>
<p>No human trial data or data on long term results. Anyone putting out a vaccine has liability protection so even if you end up with a serious reaction you have no recourse.   </p>
<p>&rt;how exactly does it infringe on your rights.   </p>
<p>My body my choice, if I choose not to get the vaccine and die, then that is on me because of my choice. What is to stop other companies demanding females take birth control next so they don't end up having to take maturity leave? It is an extreme example, but once you go down the road of having a business or agency making your medical decisions for you then it is only a matter of time. </p>
<p>The main issue is it is being pushed onto people heavily and there are too many unknowns.</p>

        <p>Vaccine passports - either coming out of government or private business, would be illegal, full stop. If you don't understand why making people show a vaccine status to do something is infringing on their rights, I'm not sure what to say.</p>

        <p>I was completely shook when I saw that tweet from Biden.  Now had he said “get vaccinated or wear a mask” that says you still have a choice.  Saying “get vaccinated or wear a mask until you do” says you better get freakin vaccinated or you will be forced to anyway”..kinda like “we can do this easy way or the hard way”.  That’s not how our country operates and it’s scary to think this is how it will be.  </p>
<p>It’s insanely obvious how this is all kinds of messed up in terms of our rights.</p>

        <p>Flat out, I don’t trust the government, full stop. And I’m not discriminatory in my skepticism - I’m not a republican, I’m not a democrat. A libertarian I guess at best and only for lack of a better word. I don’t trust the FDA. I don’t trust the CDC. I don’t trust institutions that profit off the misery of others. I’m not a Christian, I’m not Jewish, and though I’m no longer Atheist I don’t trust following blindly anyone or anything that my life experience thus far contradicts or calls into question, only to be dismissed. I have explanations for my reasoning, but their lengthy and I’m sure you don’t have the time, so my point is, in short, I trust MYSELF. I’ve made it 33 years on this earth, but for the grace of God and my own better judgement. I’m not about to cave now.</p>

        <p>I already had covid, so I have ghe antibodies, which supposedly is what a vaccine does.  anyone that has had it shouldn't need a vaccine.  I'm relatively young, healthy, and have no compounding medical conditions, so my risk is about zero.  weighing that against unknown side affects for a rushed and untested vaccine, I conclude that it's not worth the risk of potential side affects when my existing risk factor is already microscopic.  it's basic risk managment.</p>

        <p>The totalitairian governments of the UN want a vaccination app for vacations and give freedom back that everyone had before. The vaccine has 0,0016% death rate which is a little bit more. Covid has 0,0015% mortality rte what isnt a differnce. Also Ivermeticin works as a medicin to do the same effects as the vaccination. Also there are questionable things with Bill Gates his inclusion in all of this. There are even chips as tests in development.</p>

        <p>mRNA vaccines could have interactions with anyone with an autoimmune issue. The small study they did for the vaccine specifically excluded anyone with an autoimmune issue and as of a few months ago the cdc stated they had no clinical data regarding how the vaccine would impact autoimmune disorders.</p>

        <p>I’ve been against forced vaccinations for 10+ years. If you can’t see after covid that big pharma will literally let you die to make a profit then idk what will change your mind.

        <p>Well I'm sure a newer more up to date vaccine is always being studied, I do agree that corporations shouldn't try and make as much money possible with something that could really help people.

        <p>&rt;I do trust science, however I dont trust the big corporations who twist it to their own benefit, </p>
<p>So this is the situation we are currently in.</p>
<p>&rt;I do wanna know though, if the vaccine was tried and tested and free, would you take it then?</p>
<p>Free obviously has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>They say it is tested.  The same way all of those companies I listed above said their products were tested.  We only found out a few years later they were either lying, or misleading the public.  Years later.</p>
<p>Here's a fact: Zero long-term studies have been done.  Zero.  We know this, because they've only had a vaccine candidate for less than a year.</p>
<p>These vaccines are not yet approved by the FDA.  Why do you think that is?  Normally a vaccine takes 7-10 years to come to market.  This one took a few months.  It has been given "emergency use" status only.</p>
<p>So...  They haven't done the studies.</p>
<p>And they haven't gotten the approval.</p>
<p>And therefore we do not know if it is completely safe.</p>
<p>So why do you want to take it?  </p>
<p>Why do you trust Big Pharma now, after they have shown clearly they are not to be trusted?</p>

        <p>In short people are dying shortly after getting the vaccine, usually the second shot. If do believe most vaccines are only one shot, so I wonder if we are not being purposely overdoes since the vaccines are still in the testing phase. Yes, the world wide general public are lab rats to big pharma and their buddies…and that should scare the shit out of you. </p>
<p>People are also going blind from these vaccines, getting inflammation around the heart that is killing them, loosing feeling in their limbs, getting rashes all over their bodies, getting paralyzed, thousands upon thousands of women are saying their periods are all messed up now, people are getting serious blood clotting, and more. </p>
<p>I watched a video yesterday where a senator (not to sure which state) had an medical expert testify about the dangers of these vaccines. Big pharm has it documented that they started animal testing with these COVID vaccines, but stopped because all of the animals were dying. And now these vaccines have been released world wide and those in power are trying to force it onto everyone for power and money.</p>

        <p>For me it comes from a distrust of the government and a hatred for arbitrary rules and regulations. I am vaccinated in the traditional sense but I’d rather wait on this one.

        <p>&rt;what's the big deal about taking the vaccine or not taking the vaccine</p>
<p>Most don't really care all that much, as long as you aren't trying to push them to take it - whichhh is definitely being done by many in media and government. If someone wants to take it, feel free, I don't really care. Same thing with masks, etc. You do you, just don't try to force me to do it as well.</p>
<p>&rt;why so many don't want to</p>
<p>Personally, because I'm young, healthy, and unafraid of this virus with a stupidly high survival rate. Not to mention how this vaccine is different from any other created. I'm quite content not receiving it.</p>
<p>&rt;how exactly does it infringe on your rights.</p>
<p>If you're referring to taking the vaccine, it doesn't whatsoever. Though I don't think that anyone's claiming that voluntarily taking a vaccine is any kind of infringement upon their rights?</p>

        <p>Because they are not vaccines.    They are therapies to alter how our cells work.</p>
<p>This technology will be expanded and used for many purposes.   Even Moderna refers to it as an operating system that delivers 'apps' to our cells.</p>

        <p>First and foremost, vaccine mandates infringe on our rights to body autonomy. It’s forcing a medical procedure that will permanently alter our bodies (whether for better or for worse). Forcing any such procedure is an obvious violation of human rights and freedom. Imagine if all men were mandated to be circumcised for the greater good of decreasing STD rates...riots would ensue. </p>
<p>The covid vaccines specifically have people concerned because mRNA technology is still too new to fully understand yet. These vaccines have never before been tested on humans until 2020, and prior animal trials have been horrendous failures. Long term effects are completely unknown, because we simply haven’t been using them for long term. 
There are over 900 VAERS reports <em>per day</em> concerning the COVID vax. While these reports aren’t verified to be vaccine related, it does raise safety concerns which don’t seem to be getting addressed. </p>
<p>Pfizer has a criminal history of habitually paying off doctors, and suppressing adverse trial results. Moderna is such a new company, they haven’t even released a drug/vaccine to the public before—so they have 0 track record. J&amp;J also has a messy criminal history. New technology being peddled by companies with shady history is not very encouraging.</p>
<p>Some people feel, that even with the above concerns, the risk is worth it to stop covid...but is it? 
COVID has a 99.9% survival rate for the majority of the population. The elderly and at-risk population have treatments and preventative measures that can be taken. Meanwhile, an accurate vaccine efficacy rate is still unknown, and it doesn’t even prevent transmission, only reduces the symptoms. </p>
<p>There’s also concerns of the unintended kickback of vaccines in general...ADE and the evolution of worse strains in response to vaccines, to name a few. </p>
<p>So, in summary: We don’t want to take a vaccine produced by criminal companies, with unknown risks, that doesn’t even prevent transmission, and has the potential to make things even worse, all for a cold with a 99% survival rate. The vaccines are not risk-free, and perfectly healthy people with low covid risk don’t feel it’s worth the trade-off, and they should have the freedom to make that choice without being socially or legally punished.</p>
