    <strong>What if we got another "deadly" virus and then another one, and another one?</strong>
    <p><p>If that shit would be as bad as they said it would be very likely for it to happen again with a new virus just whenever. Do these clowns just suggest to lock everyone down for eternity? I pray one day these absolute whores who put these rules up and the sheep who support them will suffer like I do</p></p>

        <p>We are actually in an extremely dangerous situation now, because the powers now know how easy is to pull this shit off and the brainwashed sheep now think this is the "science" in how we deal with mild respiratory viruses. When the next mild virus pops up in 5 or 10 years they can do this shit all over again.</p>

        <p>You know dude, you can get severe symptoms, are you really going to take a 1 percent chance of dying or have someone you care about die? Pandemics happen every 100ish years anyway, the best thing we can do is take precaution. It's fine to question things, but it is not ok to deny scientific evidence (see long term effects of covid), because this virus is new, just like any other pandemic virus/ailment.</p>

<li>It's not 1% for under-50s; it's 0.2%. And that's just known, recorded, positive cases, including people with multiple co-morbidities.</li>
<li>'Long-term effects of Covid' is post-viral inflammation and fatigue, renamed by the media to sound like it's unique to Covid when it's not.</li>
<li>This virus is genetically almost identical to the original SARS-CoV. It's 'novel,' but it's very far from alien. Its immediate family is very well-understood.</li>
<li>General lockdowns were almost unknown in epidemiology before March 2020. They are a political solution pioneered by a totalitarian state, not a tool of medical science.</li>

        <p>Yes, life long asymptomatic carriers are rare. Asymptomatic infected being carriers? The absolute norm. Like 90% for Polio or 80% for ... Covid19.<br>
But hey, you can avoid reading biology books that have been true for decades to feel better, your choice.<br>
Me? I always liked reading about Robert Koch, Pettenkofer, Salk, doctors that still had (manly) to resort to discovering things by experimenting on themselves, to save fellow humans from illness and often death. I guess they'd be rolling in their graves fast enough to power Texas these days ...</p>

        <p>You seem not to understand the word 'carrier' or 'infection'. Those are spreading. Even if only 1%, that would be a lot of people you know once we caught it all. That's why people prefer vaccinations to the real thing.  </p>
<p>Because: Polio has that survival rate too. Measles, Rubella, hell Herpes has even a better chance of survival. So go on, prove your manliness with that. No vacc against the last one yet.  </p>
<p>Not? Coward! :D  </p>
<p>Btw: Those number add up. Only 100 years ago 25% of the kids didn't reach adulthood because of all those manly survivable infections.<br>
Also men die twice as often as women with Covid19. Those are only manly deaths, if they didn't spread it, else it is a traitorous manly death.  </p>

        <p>It's got a 1% death rate in aggregate of known cases. Adjusting for</p>
<p>1) age group;</p>
<p>2) co-morbidity and severity of co-morbidity;</p>
<p>3) estimated cases (based on antibody studies showing its true prevalence);</p>
<p>3) downright bizarre ways of counting 'COVID deaths' (<em>any</em> death within sixty days of a test, no matter the cause - really?).</p>
<p>the real death rate is orders of magnitude lower than that. These are all things you ought to take into consideration, if scientific truth is of any genuine interest to you, as working out the death rate of a disease is kind of a big deal when trying to assess its danger - no?</p>

<p>Ok. Give me a study for that. Some things you state might be true for the US. I'm talking from/for european countries with a socialized healthcare system and proper testing for deaths (the allegation that everybody was tagged Covid has been disbunked last year for Germany).</p>
<p>Else we can resort to statistical analysis: we only have the epidemic/pandemic at the moment and excess death in Europe clearly correlates with the highest hit countries (see <a href="https://www.euromomo.eu">Euromomo</a>).<br>
Same data from German destatis: <a href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Cross-Section/Corona/Society/population_death.html">https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Cross-Section/Corona/Society/population_death.html</a>  </p>
<p>At the moment the most thoroughly tested country here, Austria (free antigen tests for everybody) reports still 2% CFR. Let them be off an order of magnitude for the sake of the argument and wtih 0.2% we are still in the region of ... Polio and beyond Measles.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic transmission, to the extent it isn't just media bungling the distinction between a- and pre-, is far rarer than initially thought.

"Beaches and swimming pools were closed. Bowling alleys and movie theaters closed. Families left the city. The slightest illness in a child would cause a parent to panic."<br>
Well, the only reason for not having a 'general lockdown' back then might have been that the transmission was unknown and 'general mobility' was still a bit less than today, where nearly everybody reading here could go to another state tomorrow and every second to another continent by Wednesdays.</li>
<li>Let's see about 1: so why did we fear Polio, when only 0.1-1% get paralysed or die from it? Might it be that a paralyzed or dead person among 150 tends to get noticed? That 0.2% is quite high?<br>
FYI: 20% of the 40 year old have relevant pre-existing conditions. 30% of the 50 year old. Suddenly 'comorbidity' isn't such a funny word anymore?</li>

        <p>But the thing is, we are all going to catch a covid variant at some point.  It's here forever, but life has to go on.  And when I say life, I mean an emotionally healthy life.  Not an existence.  </p>
<p>I see people who worry about organ damage from covid, but consume fast food and tobacco products.</p>

        <p>The chances of me dying from covid is literally less than 0.01 when looking at the IFR for my age group. Yeah, I can also get mild symptoms or none at all, which both are again you know, 100 times more likely to happen for my age group.  You do realize pandemics happen more often, right? The Spanish Flu wasn't the last pandemic... In fact this is the mildest pandemic we ever had. It's literally a 0.2% IFR virus, that primarily kills the elderly who already passed their life expectancy. Just because the virus is new doesn't make it any more scary. We literally already had enough info on the nature of the virus and who it really effects since last February.</p>
<p>Healthy people can also get permanent heart and lung damage from the flu, common cold, and even stomach flus. Surely you knew that. But those are acceptable risks and we don’t wear masks or shut everything down every time one of those bugs is going around. </p>
<p>Why are long term effects from Covid a dealbreaker for you then? Or do just know nothing about any virus that’s not covid19? Also, completely ignore the fact that long term effects primarily occured on those with pre-existing and serious end-stage conditions who actually had to be hospitalized for covid. </p>
<p>You should so some more scientific research yourself, before you come here judging people for denying science. 
Everything concerning this virus is a massive break from all protocol and sanity.</p>

        <p>Well, because flu and cold doesn't spread as fast as covid? If flu has a 1 percent rate but infects 30k people lets say covid would infect more than that, leading to more deaths. Also, if it does kill the elderly, atleast it would be a bit more humane to prevent a often painful death? I'm just saying what i think, feel free to disagree</p>

        <p>I think it's insensitive you expect others to change their lives, because you found out pathogens exist this year. </p>
<p>You simply aren't responsible for unknowingly transmitting a new cold virus, because human beings have always existed with and transmitted relatively mild respiratory viruses. Up untill the March mass psychosis of last year, it was understood by society that unintentionally infecting someone who infected someone else, who infected someone else, who then died because they were an 85 year-old, is not anyone's fault. How do you think my grandparents died of the flu?</p>

        <p>Be honest with yourself. Have a little introspection and admit that you didn’t give a crap about infecting other people with anything before this past year. Have you worn a mask every flu season before this? If you knew yourself at all, you’d willingly admit that you only care now because your television told you to.

<p>You're stating that you would have always wore masks in the past, but didn't wear one because they were expensive. By that logic you're admitting that people's lives are only worth what you deemed cheap vs expensive.</p>
<p>You didn't wear masks, which means you unknowingly killed some grandma somewhere, but u deem it ok because masks were too expensive?</p>

        <p>Where  did i mention incubation? I has nothing to do with infection or transmission rates. Say I get infected in a Saturday, and Sunday they enforce the strictist if lockdowns, you say the idea of a lockdown being in place will stop the virus from making me ill after I'm infected. You are saying the virus transmitted really slowly before lockdowns and not many got infected, then lockdowns happened and transmission speeded up, and thats why we need lockdowns. That did not happen</p>

        <p>Viruses often infect a host. Take a bit to become infectious then cause symptoms. Usually the symptoms show up because our bodies are trying to stop the virus and covid often makes our immune system overreact. This is why long term symptoms are more common in covid than the flu. We can't predict what we will get but we can try to prevent things. Maybe someone i know is sick and i don't know, best thing i can do is take mild precautions and hope for the best. Lockdowns are to make sure the spreading isn't too large. To try to contain it. I don't like it either but you sometimes have to forsake things to prevent worse things from happening. I really do find immunology interesting and i plan to research it when i get into the right specialty</p>

        <p>They want you to take a drug for every virus on the planet. That's the goal. It is already happening with diseases they want you to believe you have. So, one drug for the heart another for the brain, another for back pain, another for digestion etc. And then one drug for each side effect, every one of the previous drugs causes. You get the picture.</p>

        <p>This is exactly why I feel I am at my breaking point here. </p>
<p>I lost my job. I lost my freedom in my own home. I can't even open the door in my own house and walk outside on a deserted street in the middle of the night with a mask on or "I'll kill us all in here don't you dare". Walking was my life, and I walked 40k steps a day on average before.  </p>
<p>Now I'm forced inside 24/7 in the name of health for over a year in some small cramped house.  </p>
<p>The fact that the government and the only people I could live with currently will do and support this seemingly endlessly has shattered my view of everything. They'll gladly do it again and again when ever they feel fit, I'm sure. </p>
<p>I was on board with a lockdown to make it go away at first, but it just won't go away. Nothing changes. Only bad news and promises constantly moved and just out of reach like some carrot on a stick. </p>
<p>I wish I lived with people like you all here if anything.</p>

        <p>As some Democraps have poignantly  stated, never let a good crisis go to waste.  So if/when these pile up as suggested, they will take the opportunity to continue their totalitarian views on how to handle these situations.  It has been about command and control this entire time.  Period.</p>

        <p>It’s most likely to happen for ever and ever. Didn’t Russia said that they’ve registered the first human infection with H5N8? I’m guessing rona is loosing power globally and they are in need of a new virus to keep us locked in our houses until the end of times.</p>
