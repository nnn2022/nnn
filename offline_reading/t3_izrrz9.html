        <p>As long as people think we can "control" the virus, we'll never get back to normal.</p>
<p>The return to normal will come when people finally realize they <em>can't</em> control the virus, and we just have to live with it.  A vaccine will help, but it won't stop the virus.  As long as people keep thinking we need to eradicate and "control" the virus, we're fucked.</p>

        <p>I took a look at his submissions (though only a couple of pages of his comments), and didn't see anything submitted to /r/covidiots or /r/moronavirus. Some of the submissions he's posted at /r/worldnews, et al, are either the kind he's posted here, or the sort that's dubiously pro-lockdown or neutral (like about economic damage due to the lockdowns, or Sweden's "failed" herd immunity strategy, for instance). I might've missed something, so could you link to something he posted at the /r/covidiots sub, for instance?</p>
<p>Don't know this person personally, but he doesn't seem to be actively trolling us specifically. If he is, he is likely just karma farming, knowing that this sub gives easy upvotes for anti-lockdown/New Normal material. Mind explaining, /u/Mighty_L_Lort?</p>
<p>(You did make similar accusations at me a while ago because I disagree with many opinions expressed at LDS back when I was active there, so I feel a little prickly and hesitant to just blindly believe accusations you are launching here.)</p>

<p>I don't think I did. I've only mentioned behavior of this sort about one other account, and that was recent and not about you, unless you comment under multiple accounts.  Can you PM me a link to where you think I did that?</p>
<p>On the one hand, it's certainly possible it's karma farming, however the account has doubled down on negative karma comments (of their own), and has a number of very low magnitude posts and comments.</p>
<p>Other accounts that appear to be karma farming do things like find posts from among the all time top posts and repost them.  This account does nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Either I was misremembering about the account posting in CovIdiots specifically, or it was further back than what I reviewed last night. I'm on mobile so things that might be trivial to do on a computer are a <em>whole lot</em> more challenging.  Perhaps next time I get on my computer, I can be more certain about CovIdiots in specific.</p>
<p>In Canada sub, the account posts/comments using phrasing to imply they are from/in Canada and America is bad and stupid, and Canada should fear and hate America, and keep it's borders closed.</p>
<p>In Europe sub, the account posts/comments using phrasing to imply they are from/in Europe, and how stupid and wrong Sweden is and was was not locking down.</p>
<p>In UK sub, the account posts/comments using phrasing to imply they are from/in UK, and America is bad and stupid, and UK's troubles are America's fault.</p>
<p>In France sub, the account posts (in French, from typing, not cut and paste) about America bad. "Cry like an American" was one of them.</p>
<p>I saw one post in Sweden sub, in Swedish. I don't recall the content of that posts, but there was one comment chastising the account name specifically for posting in Sweden sub, and not even bothering using their weekly thread.</p>
<p>Other than as above, the account typically uses phrasing to imply it's a person from/in America.  IIRC, there was at least one state sub where the account commented in that they are in/from that state.</p>
<p>In all subs, especially ones like news, worldnews, etc the account posts/comments from a perspective of how frightening the virus is, 'look at this big number; you should be very afraid if it's, how worried about everything everybody should be.</p>
<p>In Moronavirus, the account posts (for example) about how various activities/events are "liked" or "approved" by the virus; a seemingly subtle attempt to confirm/incite the idea that everybody should cower in fear at home and not do anything.</p>
<p>Of the posts/comments I've seen so far, some could be considered dubiously pro-lockdown, others are more clearly pro-lockdown, and not skeptical at all, including some that suggest extreme lockdowns.</p>
<p>In various subs, including politics as well as subs that are apolitical, sometimes the account is anti trump, sometimes the account is anti biden, and there's quite a lot of posts that are simply of a nature to try to be inflammatory while being vague, along the lines of "if our next election goes a certain way ..."</p>
<p>None of this is an evolution of view, as anybody might have.  It's all interwoven.</p>
<p>I strongly doubt any of the posts or comments are electronically generated.</p>
<p>It's definitely not a human that's trying to engage with other humans in any human or sociable sense, which I'm thinking is the general expectation most people have for interactions here unless otherwise indicated (such as utility bots).</p>
<p>The account doesn't seem to EVER post anything of a positive nature or sentiment.  It seems to all be negative (or at best, some arguably neutral).</p>
<p>It really seems to be a psychological strategy of trying to manipulate public mind share in a number of negative ways, especially including fomenting fear, dissent, and divisiveness among the Western world, and trying to blow up the perceived severity of this virus that we all now know to actually be extremely low.</p>

        <p>It creeps me out how certain they are that "the overwhelming majority of the population" will get the vaccine. Implying that we won't have much of a choice.</p>
<p>Check this part out:</p>
<p>&rt; And then there’s the problem of actual shot-in-arm delivery. Pfizer’s vaccine, for example, needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius. “No doctor’s office has negative 70,” says Emanuel. “You can’t do ‘the usual’—you know, this sort of hodgepodge we have of CVSes, Walmarts, … Walgreens, doctor’s offices, schools.” CDC guidance suggests states prepare to distribute doses at hospitals and mobile clinics.</p>
<p>&rt; Making sure that most Americans receive two doses of the same vaccine four weeks apart smoothly and efficiently will be a massive government operation—one that Emanuel thinks the country can pull off no earlier than November 2021—and that’s if you have “good management skills, good logistics,” he says. “If there is some element of optimism and not just realism, it’s in that. There is no evidence this administration has the capacity to manage that.”</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; It’s 2021, and you’ve just gotten your two doses. What happens next will largely depend on two factors: How effective the vaccine is and how many people get it.</p>
<p>&rt; The goal is for the vaccine to be effective and widespread enough for the U.S. population to reach the herd immunity threshold—the point at which, theoretically, Americans can safely take off their masks and attend large sporting events. A rough, back-of-the-envelope estimate for Covid-19 (derived from calculating the point at which each infected person, on average, infects less than one other person) is that society will reach herd immunity when around 60 percent to 70 percent of the population is immune.</p>
<p>&rt; Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, walked through the math: Roughly, “the formula would state that about two-thirds of the population would need to be vaccinated if [the vaccine] was 75 percent effective against shedding” (i.e., transmitting) the virus. If the vaccine is less effective than that, a greater percentage of the population needs to get vaccinated to close in on herd immunity. And vice versa.</p>
<p>&rt; Experts aren’t optimistic that these first-generation vaccines are going to be highly effective at preventing transmission. “The likelihood that we are hitting a home run in the first at bat is just very low,” says Michael Kinch, director of the Centers for Research Innovation in Biotechnology and Drug Discovery at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
<p>&rt; Nor has the FDA set the bar very high: The agency indicated that any approved vaccine must prevent Covid-19 or decrease severity in at least 50 percent of those vaccinated, but that means more than 50 percent of the population could continue to transmit the disease.</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Without a highly effective vaccine, the country needs relatively high vaccination rates. And yet a whopping two-thirds of Americans say they won’t get the vaccine when it’s first available—and a quarter say they’ll never get it. Many scientists fear that so many people are going to refuse to get both doses of a vaccine out of distrust or fear or just plain forgetfulness that America won’t reach a high level of protection, much less herd immunity.</strong></p>
<p>&rt; “Apparently, these shots with Covid … they give you some fevers, some chills, you feel a little flu-like,” says Emanuel. “Well, how many Americans are coming back [to say], ‘Oh, I would like that again. I would like to feel like under the weather for a few days to get this vaccine.’ … What I worry about is we have a lot of people who are only partially immunized with one shot.”</p>
<p>And here's the scary part that /u/Mighty_L_Lort and /u/neemarita are citing:</p>
<p>&rt; The world will probably live with Covid-19 forever, even after inoculation. “I think a lot of people seem to think that vaccines automatically eradicate viruses,” says Rasmussen. “They don’t.” To date, only two viruses have ever been officially eradicated.</p>
<p>&rt; But many experts believe that, if vaccination rates are high enough, the Covid-19 of the future is going to be manageable, routine, just another virus that most Americans have some degree of immunity to. Some of that protection will come from natural infection and disease exposure; and some of it will come from vaccination.</p>
<p>&rt; “It’s very likely that in a vaccinated population, [Covid-19] would do very little damage,” says Krammer.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; There’s also been a lot of worry about how long immunity from disease lasts; some Covid-19 victims have already gotten reinfected with the virus, in at least one case severely. While the media will always seize on the most unusual, most sensational medical cases, many infectious disease specialists believe that, even if a person’s immunity wanes after infection—as it does for other coronaviruses—future infections, on average, are probably going to be weaker than the first.</p>
<p>&rt; In fact, getting exposed to Covid-19 will be a crucial part of developing protection. “Eventually, you’ll have enough people who have … built up a little bit of immunity, whether that’s through vaccine or maybe you’ve been infected once. And then the next time you get exposed, it actually serves as a natural boosting event. It boosts your immunity instead of harms you,” says Mina.</p>
<p>&rt; “Let’s say somebody turns 60 in five years,” he games out. “They’re 55 years old now. They get a vaccine next year and maybe they get an exposure. By the time they’re 60, they might have had two or three exposures. And so they won’t be as at risk anymore when they’re 60 because they’ve now gained enough immune memory.”</p>
<p>&rt; Krammer envisions that in the long term, people will get vaccinated or infected when they’re kids, building up more immunity through revaccination and reexposure. “And by the time they are really in the high-risk group, which starts at 50, … they probably are not going to have a severe disease anymore, but they might get the sniffles,” he says.</p>
<p>&rt; At the same time, experts are crossing their fingers that treatments and therapies are going to get better, so that those few who do end up with severe cases are vastly more likely to live. An antiviral drug—which weakens a virus if you take it early enough—would be a game changer, says Landon, “but that’s some years away.” And it will be important for scientists to keep delivering new drugs and treatments. “Maybe remdesivir plus convalescent plasma plus two new drugs in the future and rolling someone on their stomach might do the job until … the virus naturally develops resistance to one of them and now you’ve got to substitute in a new drug,” says Kinch.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt; Perhaps, faced with this calculation, large portions of American society will decide not to follow the inexorable track back to “normal.” Perhaps masks will become the norm in winter, when coronaviruses spread more readily, and handshakes won’t return.</p>
<p>&rt; “I think there’s going to be a fundamental fear,” says Kinch. “My grandparents lived through the Depression. And for the rest of their lives, even when they had money and some degree of financial security, they to a degree acted like they were living through the Depression.”</p>
<p>&rt; “And that’s not meant [to be] gloom and doom,” he adds. “The new normal will be fine, and we’ll get through it just fine. But I don’t think we’ll go back to January in my lifetime.”</p>
