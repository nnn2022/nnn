        <p>Have you been to a store lately? Completely illogical nonsense. 
BREAHTE SHIT DIAPER FACE. We know you will since you can't comprehend the following...It is absurd to deny that face diapers collect and breed bacteria, collect dead cells, and collect virus particles. It is not common knowledge, but bacteria and dead cells are express buses for viruses. Add that to the fact you are breathing in this pathogen soup over and over. Face diapers are not only INCREASING the spread of viruses, they are MULTIPLYING the spread of bacteria. When they say someone died of complications of covid, they usually mean BACTERIAL pneumonia. What better source of BACTERIA than a face diaper. After face diaper mandates were implemented, cases SKYROCKETED, but through some twisted lawyer/politician logic, that was an excuse for more mandates. A face diaper is mandated self harm.

        <p>So you've got a random YT video, an article that just redirects you to a YT video, an article on the Spanish flu of 1918, a study about how one's oral hygiene can interact with covid, an article about <em>hospital workers'</em> PPE (ie. Mask, face shield, gown, gloves, etc... not just a mask), an article on HIV (how is this relevant?), and a small study where just about half of the participants actually followed the rules....</p>

<p>“The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Instead, most victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection. The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs.”</p>
<p>They wouldn’t have been wearing masks when they got bacterial pneumonia. They were sick and isolated, and being cared for by people wearing masks. </p>
<p>Influenza is way down in all areas with good mask mandates.</p>

        <p>BREAHTE SHIT DIAPER FACE. We know you will since you can't comprehend the following...It is absurd to deny that face diapers collect and breed bacteria, collect dead cells, and collect virus particles. It is not common knowledge, but bacteria and dead cells are express buses for viruses. Add that to the fact you are breathing in this pathogen soup over and over. Face diapers are not only INCREASING the spread of viruses, they are MULTIPLYING the spread of bacteria. When they say someone died of complications of covid, they usually mean BACTERIAL pneumonia. What better source of BACTERIA than a face diaper. After face diaper mandates were implemented, cases SKYROCKETED, but through some twisted lawyer/politician logic, that was an excuse for more mandates. A face diaper is mandated self harm.
