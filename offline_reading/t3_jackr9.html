        <p>The quote from this which most struck me was: "<em>If we have a situation where we're not able to touch the people in our daily lives that we normally touch, it's not like everything is going to fall apart instantly. But our feelings of connection, of empathy, of trust will slowly degrade</em> "</p>
<p>This is going to be a major consequence of continuing to distance and wear masks. It makes us afraid of each other, and loses the connection which is necessary for compassionate caring. The social and political effects of this will be to make people more selfish.</p>
<p>Particularly if you're more left-wing, you should oppose masks and distancing, because the result will be lower support for social democratic policies. People will only support redistributive policies if they have a strong sense of community and trust towards their fellow citizens. That's being subtly taken away by masks and separation.</p>

        <p>Once again - the far left wingers are shooting themselves in the groin.</p>
<p>So in addition to more poor children, women’s advancement being knocked back 30 years, the dramatically increasing income inequality gap, children of color, poor parents and learning disabilities falling farther and farther behind their rich white and Asian counterparts, blowing a hole in the budget so big that (in the US) M4A is now only pipe dream, propping up big corporations at the expense of small businesses, humans won’t want to support other humans because they don’t feel connected to them?</p>
<p>Is it possible that they can all be so stupid they just ruined all of their own goals within 6 months?</p>

        <p>I get so fucking angry when people say "just social distance",  "just wear a mask", "just stay home" (Although the last two aren't used in my country).</p>
<p>No. This is not just a "small" sacrifice, it's taking away our human nature and giving us increased anxiety and distrust for other humans (as said in the clip). 
The absolute ingorance from public health officials and politicians are making my days rage inducing and depressed and i don't know how i'm going to handle this. </p>
<p>I hope those of us that understand this will actually make a difference someday.</p>

        <p>&rt;However, there is some good news. Fauci told the Journal that he hopes to see “light at the end of the tunnel … where we can say we’re pretty confident that we can gradually start approaching some degree of normality” by the end of April.</p>

        <p>I'm a professional cuddler. Living without touch is like living without sunlight, you can do it, but it's grim. I'm doing all I can to get clients to leave their houses, because unfortunately when you go without touch for a long time, it's much harder to get. The covid hikokimori are in such big trouble, overstimulated with social media, completely isolated, and getting worse. It's going to be a hard winter for folks with Seasonal Affective Disorder.</p>
<p>When people come in after no touch for months, sometimes years, it's always the same - reluctance, floods of tears, immense gratitude. </p>
<p>I really worry that some of the most aggressive covid-orthadoxy are people who have went without touch for a long time and have now given up. Plenty will need years of therapy before they even consider touch again.</p>
<p>It has broken my heart every day since March that I can't get to all these people before some of them die from lack of touch.</p>

        <p>I did an online course with Cuddlist. It's something I'm pretty passionate about, really rewarding. As much as I wish it didn't have to exist, it could be good to have a lot more pro-cuddlers out there to help reintegrate people back into society. If you think it's something you'd be interested in, it's worth checking out :)</p>

<p>There was never any specific advice for cuddling, so when masseuses opened again in the UK, I reopened with as few precautions as I could get away with. There needs to be closer contact for it to work, so it's a mitigated risk. I have clients at risk of much more dangerous things than covid, so it's a tough ethical decision to turn people away when businesses are shutting again soon :(</p>
