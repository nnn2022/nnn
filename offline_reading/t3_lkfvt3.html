    <strong>What is the cause of excess deaths in 2020</strong>
    <p><p>I am pretty much on board with this sub, and I understand that we know the death count is inflated because health officials saying a death WITH covid counts as a death from, but its hard to know by exactly how much. So we know the official number is too high, and its obvious that things over the past year would lead to increases in suicides, overdoses, etc., but there seems to be too many deaths in 2020 compared to 2019 or 2018 for me to think that those kinds of deaths would have played a big role in that count.</p>
<p>Basically what I'm saying is, there certainly seems to have been an abnormally high death count in 2020, so how do you explain that?</p></p>

        <p>The death rate in the US is going up at a steady peace since 2013. There's no significant change that I can see. Check this out: https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate</p>
<p>It is exactly what you'd expect with aging population. You have more and more old people, and thus more and more deaths. That's how it works.</p>

        <p>Using the death rate given there you get about 2,900,000 deaths, but the “official” number is well over 3 million, so something doesn’t add up</p>

        <p>I didn't calculate it like you did, obviously, but those data are referenced from the UN, so assuming you're correct, either the UN is lying or the US is underreporting it's death rate to the UN. Or.... Or the CDC is bullshitting people</p>

        <p>Well, that intrigued me so I took the time to look stuff up. And... Can't find any legitimate data source claiming death rate in 2020 to be higher than 8.9 per 1000. And in most cases it's rounded to one decimal place, so 8.88 is totally consistent.</p>

        <p>What counts as a legitimate data source though? I’m somewhat willing to trust the cdcs total deaths numbers, but given the way Covid deaths are being counted it’s reasonable to not trust that. So what are you looking at for 2020 deaths then</p>

        <p>But do they actually say the death rate was higher than 8.9 per 1,000, or are they just saying it's soooooo much higher than in than the year before, omg omg omg be very afraid?</p>

<p>I gave this link somewhere else in this thread, but there’s a chart with deaths from all causes. If you subtract out the deaths from 2021, you are left with 3.3 million or something like that, which is more like 10 per 1000.</p>

        <p>I'll have to get back to you when I have the time and the will to do the math on that set of numbers. Which is pretty darn odd, btw, because if they wanted to show something, not just yap, they would have done so.</p>

        <p>I’m sure there are plenty of scare articles and whatnot out there, I see a little bit of that when I try to look for numbers of total deaths for the year, but it doesn’t seem like it’s really been a talking point for people who support lockdowns. Maybe it’s just implied that the “400k Covid deaths” are excess when people talk about them, I don’t know.</p>

        <p>I’m well aware of the problems with the cdc, but you can’t exactly blur the lines on whether someone died or not like you can with whether they died of corona or something else. If they died they died so I’ve been going with the assumption that at least their number of how many deaths occurred is more or less accurate.</p>
<p>I guess you could claim that they made up deaths that didn’t happen or something but I’d need to see something convincing for that</p>

        <p>You are absolutely correct, most countries have at least some excess death, but for most it isnt unusually high. The US has more than it ever has had as % of the population than it has in at least in the past 20 years, and more than it did with other big epidemics. We are probably at least about 50-100 thousand deaths over what it 'should' be. Not just CDC but individual states also show the excess.</p>
<p>No one knows the cause for US yet, dont know if we ever will. Hospitals being closed, more overdoses maybe... If OD and suicides doubled that would be enough to cause the unusual high numbers. But there doesnt seem a good reason why US would be so much higher than UK for example.</p>

<p>Here there is a chart with deaths from all causes. If you subtract out the numbers from 2021 you still end up with well over 3 million deaths. Is it just an aging population and these deaths are overdue, deaths of despair? Where did they come from is what I want to know</p>

<p>Is this sketchy to you or no? Also that data is definitely at least in part gathered by the NIH (fauci). That’s literally the person I think most of us.. for sure myself has the very least trust in. Dr Dre is more trusted to me than fauci.</p>

        <p>I’m well aware of the sketchiness surrounding the counting of Covid deaths. My point is that regardless of what they really died from, they died, and according to those numbers a lot more people died than in the last few years. It seems like your explanation for that is simply that you don’t trust the cdc or the governments numbers about total deaths which is fine reasoning, I just want to gauge people’s thoughts</p>

        <p>Do you have another source on the excess? I’m being genuine and will converse openly. Discourse is good. John’s Hopkins or Mayo? Something like that. Most data I’ve seen does not show extra deaths. Also I’m not being sarcastic I’m just stating that what I see is mostly the flu and pneumonia deaths are way down and so are other respiratory deaths. When you run PCR improperly and then put a bounty on a covid patient .. bounty being what hospitals get paid by .gov for covid patients.. I mean if they even cough... the hospitals need money to make up for the huge loss of minor outpatient procedure they lost out on.. you can’t blame them for using the benign code.</p>

        <p>So to be fair I went on Yandex which is a Russian search engine and may even prefer to show a bias towards Americans failings with covid. There really isn’t definitive answers to be had. WHO. CDC. NIH. Mayo. John’s Hopkins. They all agree the data isn’t easy to process and often some areas don’t report and that often deaths aren’t reported for 6-12 weeks. There is varying articles about excess deaths. Some of the arguments are that yes covid is causing deaths. I think it is causing some. But the counter point to that is suicides are very high. The lockdowns and fear for months limited or scared people from going to the doctor and also mitigated many procedures that needed done from happening and scans that could have caught underlying issues. I have stopped going for my lab work because I lost my job. So it’s complicated. I don’t say it doesn’t exist but I do say many factors are at play here. I think the “cure” is far far worse than the disease.</p>

        <p>I certainly agree our cure has been worse than the disease. Even if Covid did cause every death that’s been attributed to it it still wouldn’t warrant this reaction, partly because the reaction is just way too harsh, and also because it has done nothing to prevent any deaths.</p>
<p>Now maybe more people didn’t even die this year than would have been expected, but if they actually did then it seems important to figure out where they came from, especially if the other argument is just going to be that Covid killed them.</p>

        <p>Yes I’ve been done with the way it’s been handled for a very long time. However, if someone were to ask me why all these extra people died I’m not going to tell them “well actually there weren’t extra deaths in 2020” if I don’t have a good way to see that that’s true.</p>
<p>With Covid deaths we know those are inflated because people have said deaths WITH Covid count as deaths from, and you can go look at death records and see Covid listed as a secondary cause of someone who died from a gunshot for example. I don’t have any similar way to verify that the cdcs total death count is inaccurate, so my next step is, given the knowledge that the Covid count is inflated, try to figure out where those extra deaths came from.</p>

        <p>https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-raw-death-count</p>
<p>Rather than just dismiss this as outright fabrication of death numbers, what I believe happened is a consolidation of deaths in time amongst very vulnerable populations. When COVID hit a nursing home or a hospital, people who had life expectancies of a few months to a few years unfortunately met a slightly earlier demise. The average age of death (high) and comorbidities (many) data support this.</p>
<p>I predict in 2021/2022, we will have below average total mortality. A few peeks in 2020 saw the deaths of people who would have otherwise been spread out over time.</p>
<p>What became clear very early on in the “pandemic” and remains true today, is that a very small minority of all COVID deaths, maybe 1-2%, happen in otherwise healthy people.</p>

        <p>Excess deaths is a fuzzy calculation and one to be careful with, but as you say total mortality is also up by 200-300k. Unfortunately, death counting is all sorts of screwed up, so causes are not easy to come by. We know suicides are up, drug od is up, crime is up, but by how much? We know cancer screenings have been skipped, people aren't calling ambulances for heat attacks or strokes, but is that enough?</p>
<p>For most of Europe, total mortality is only barely elevated, to levels from a couple years ago. For the US, we're on par with 2008 I think (population growth adjusted).</p>
<p>But to answer? I don't know. They're not all covid deaths for myriad reasons but that doesn't provide an answer. Given the cdc is still manipulating models to fear monger, I'm not sure we can count on them for the real number breakdowns either.</p>
<p>Edit: I will add that mortality displacement needs to be considered as well. With a very mild previous year, deaths are expected to be higher. This is what excess deaths are designed to account for, they're just easily manipulated. Really you need to know what portion of the population is vulnerable, past the point in life where otherwise mild diseases are fatal. This number is nearly unknowable until after the fact however.</p>

        <p>Yeah this is pretty much the conclusion I have reached, that we can’t really tell. Assuming the cdc isn’t completely making up total death numbers then the deaths had to come from somewhere, and we know they weren’t all Covid but knowing much more than that seems difficult</p>

<p>I'm on board with fudging numbers due to COVID-19, but you can't just fudge a death certificate.</p>
<p>The excess mortality is in the range of 200k, and not all of COVID's 400k. This means, there is some overlap. It's still strikingly high in the US. Overdoses, suicide? Extremely unhealthy population susceptible to COVID? Unnecessary deaths due to forced ventilation? It's hard to tell.</p>
<p>It's definitely a hard call to claim these statistics would be faked, because they'd also have to fake death certificates for it, from which the statistics are derived from, which would also mean a whole other level of fraud, instead of just labelling e.g. cancer deaths as COVID-19, because the patient was conveniently also infected by a highly contagious virus, and there was financial incentive for hospitals to do so.</p>

        <p>there is no abnormal death count.  there was a weak flu season in 2020 and 2019, which left more senior citizens living longer. Plus the baby boomers are standing on the river Styx. thus that gives us 2 vectors of extra folks.  But please check out, Ivor Cummings.  The Fat Emperor.  i have attended his workshop and were on a cholesterol lowering experiment back in 2017.  he knows his stuff and talks in a clear irish voice.   <a href="https://thefatemperor.com/ep103-viral-impact-in-england-the-empirical-truth-part-1/">https://thefatemperor.com/ep103-viral-impact-in-england-the-empirical-truth-part-1/</a></p>
