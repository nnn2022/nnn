        <p>&rt;but what is reddit if not a place to share opinions and search for like minded individuals</p>
<p>A tool for propaganda. </p>
<p>Yes there are some subs that have only a few people reading by who can have posts that contain a lot more critical thinking, but for the most part, reddit is extremely restricted and fascist in it's censorship, and obviously so.</p>

        <p>Agreed, but at the the same time here you and I converse while we reside in this environment. Am I to believe that the supercomputer algorithm machine has led you and me together or do I think we still have time to stop what we started a long time ago.</p>

        <p>It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning."   Eisenhower as President, 1953-61, Eisenhower Library; National Archives and Records Administration. On January 17, 1961, in this farewell address, President Dwight Eisenhower warned against the establishment of a "military-industrial complex." Cash rules everything around me creme get the money. Also everything the CIA has ever done. I am so screwed between thinking America has more civil liberties then most and also knowing we have manufactured one of the most oppressive regimes “CIA” to ever exist. This post will paint me as a target I do not care they are an oppressive regime that has gone on for too long unblemished by their dirty past. What you call who’re privilege I call global domineering. Colors would be too simple for this equation. We only have each other so please tach your children to respect truth, adhere to science, and fight for the what they know is right. We will need each other in the end.</p>

        <p>I get what you are saying, and I'm sure you are well meaning and have good intentions, though there are some important things to point out:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our  banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a  revolution before tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>While a lot of people don't know about how much of a scam it is, the main problem is that people are forced to use it. </p>
<p>So the issue isn't even the inflation theft or the "federal banking" scam, or the  or whatever - but there being a ruling class bossing around, exploiting and abusing masses of people. And the monetary system hiding basically what amounts to a caste system is one way they do that, but not the root, just a symptom.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;also knowing we have manufactured one of the most oppressive regimes “CIA” to ever exist</p>
<p>This is the heart of the issue - "we" didn't. </p>
<p>I'm not responsible for the cia or whatever other branch of the ruling class. And claiming so is victim blaming, the enslaved are not responsible for being victims of enslavers (and that is true even if they would have acted stupid or made mistakes, still the aggressor is 100% at fault, never the victim).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The whole "we" did this, "they" did this - collectivism claim is simply not true. There is no collective entity called "the americans" or "the germans" that all did some specific thing and are now all responsible because they happen to live in a specific geographical area. And the problem and severe evilness in the believe of it is that it used as a pseudo-justification for extreme amounts of offensive violence:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Think of "oh all those evil germans" and because of that they bombed completely innocent humans to pieces (including infants and small children, which makes the severe crime very obvious), who had nothing to do with what some other criminals in the same geographic area did, but are being attacked or murdered for the crimes of somebody else - by people who are severe criminals themselves.</p>

        <p>So here is where I am at, you can finally convince half the world that is their fault for the disenfranchisement of mixed peoples. How else can we conform to fighting an actual enemy divided by race. How else can we actually join forces to when the internet controls your side. Am I a bot probably, but it is wierd to consider this and it scares me to think people exist who never consider this at all.</p>
