    <strong>Anyone lives somewhere where they routinely test people for antibodies?</strong>
    <p><p>Seems to me like figuring out how many people are already immune to covid-19 would be the first thing you'd want to do when coming up with vaccination programs and all that shit. Anyone's actually doing that?</p></p>

        <p>There have been a few big studies, but in general you need quality near-random sampling to draw sweeping conclusions, and that's hard, expensive, and slow.</p>

        <p>You know, I'm asking, because while I'm not aware of any actual studies, I've read about several instances where groups of people were tested for various reasons, and it was generally showing that over half already had the antibodies. And considering that apparently there's not enough vaccine for everyone who wants to take it, it kinda make sense to only give it to people who aren't immune already.</p>

        <p>It makes sense, but it requires separating groups in to "positive PCR but no antibodies, so you didn't actually have it" and "actual antibodies, you really had the disease" which I doubt they're willing to do, because it admits the uselessness of PCR.</p>
<p>Also, the longer it takes to vaccinate people the more this gets drawn out, which still seems to be the goal of some people.</p>
<p>I absolutely agree with you, I just don't see the sane approach being relevant to the conversation.</p>
