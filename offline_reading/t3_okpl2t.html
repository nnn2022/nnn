        <p>Vaccine passports were being discussed openly by government officials before it ever caught on in conspiracy theorist groups. But certainly there was no talk <em>last week</em> (from anyone with half a clue) about them being a conspiracy, as it's been a widely discussed consideration for a while. So the point still stands either way.</p>

        <p>Sort of Poe's law here. I've seen a lot of revisionist history recently of people claiming that they "predicted" what was going to happen, and that they were victimized as a result of making the prediction. Kind of hard to tell the difference between an idiot believing their own imaginary history and one joking about it, because they both read ridiculously.</p>

        <p>&rt;Vaccine passports were not a conspiracy last week, but they certainly were last summer/fall.</p>
<p>When I originally heard this claim, I was confused because my recollection is that public talk and conspiratorial talk of it both kind of rose up at around the same time.</p>
<p>Public officials were publicly talking about vaccine passports <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/immunity-passports-could-speed-up-return-to-work-after-covid-19">no later than March of 2020.</a></p>
<p>When I originally did this research, the first mention of a vaccine passport didn't happen until April of 2020 on /r/conspiracy. At least a month after it had originally been talked about. This sub was not even created until June 2020.</p>
<p>The idea was being discussed publicly before conspiracy theorists latched onto it, and claimed that they came up with it first.</p>
<p>Sure, people called it a conspiracy theory, but you can find stupid uninformed people saying pretty much anything you want, but unless you can show me where it was being discussed in conspiracy circles before that (I've asked this before and gotten nothing) then there is no reason to believe that conspiracy theorists came up with the idea.</p>

        <p>Vaccines were hardly even a reality in March 2020. They were years out, and when Trump announced operation warp speed, the media and the left collectively announced that they would not take Trump's vaccine. That lasted a week or so before they began to embrace the vaccine and start to consider what the rollout would look like. This is when I remember conspiracy theories about vaccine passports surfacing, with world leaders denying them first, then slowly starting to publicly consider the concept.</p>
<p>But all that said, even if it never was a conspiracy, it's still a bad idea and us having this argument is bedside the point. The amount of power over individuals by the government would grow dramatically. We would be handing over freedom in unprecedented fashion. Even worse than the patriot act. And for what? How much additional safety will vaccine passports buy us? How much is your risk from Covid reduced? You seem to like sources and data. Do you have any idea what your risk is? Do you have any idea how much your risk is reduced by the vaccine, and how much further it is reduced by everyone getting vaccinated? Then consider if it's worth it to essentially segregate society and give the government a very powerful tool over you, keeping in mind that it won't always be "the good guys" who are in power.</p>

        <p>&rt;Vaccines were hardly even a reality in March 2020.</p>
<p>And yet I linked you to an article <em>from March 2020</em> about how immunity/vaccine passports could be used to speed the return to normal, made publicly by public officials. This is the first instance I can see of this being discussed, and I've found nothing from conspiracy theorists that pre-dates this.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm on the fence about the passports. On one hand I agree with you that I don't want to see a segregation of society. However, on the other hand, I can see how a private business might want to protect their employees and other patrons by requiring them, and believe that that is their right. And I don't see many doing it.</p>
<p>I am absolutely against big government mandating it one way or another for private businesses - like DeSantis did in FL and what Greece is suggesting here - because I think it should be up to the business and don't believe (and I think it's being played out in real time) that most businesses want anything to do with limiting their customer base and dealing with the backlash of asking "papers please."</p>
<p>But, unfortunately, such as in FL, big government has already stepped in to take control over private businesses for seemingly no reason.</p>

        <p>Just stop man, you're just way off with this. I don't need articles to tell me how I was treated for saying vaccine / health passports would be pushed back in March last year - I was treated like a crazy insane guy and everyone said 'don't worry that will never happen'.  I'm sure there are a lot of others in here with the same experience.  Even then, the article you linked refers to natural immunity which apparently DOESN'T EXIST according to the mainstream media (but does exist according to a study in Nature), so it doesn't even show what you apparently want it to.</p>

        <p>The article is referring to a sort of passport for people who have already had Covid, and therefore have natural immunity. I wonder how that would be received today? Natural immunity is like the opposite of vaccine passports, where it used to be accepted fact but is quickly becoming a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Desantis' law is pandering to his base with a hot button issue, and I generally agree that the market should sort this stuff out. It only becomes a problem if too many companies do it and eventually people can't shop for essentials. Also I think we need to be very cautious when it comes to any level of segregation in society, as it is only a couple steps away from fascism. Like ACTUAL fascism. What happened in nazi germany can happen here as well, or anywhere. It's in all of us to be that way, and we are all capable of atrocities or turning a blind eye to them. We can't even BEGIN to go there.</p>

        <p>Except the lab leak hasn't been proven true, it's just plausible. I'm not denying it, it always seemed plausible to me, but it hasn't been "proven right." Not even close. We'll probably never know the origin.</p>
<p>I'm not saying conspiracy theorists never got it right early on - a broken clock is still right twice a day - it's just that I've watched this shift to taking credit for things they didn't even predict and then pretending that they were ostracized or attacked for it. It's no different than Smollet making up some BS where he was the victim, except it seems to be on a more massive scale.</p>

        <p>I noticed that someone will randomly force vaccines into a topic or subreddit that's completely irrelevant to Covid or vaccines. If you call them out on it, you're down voted to oblivion but here's the weird part.</p>
<p>The downvotes are usually around the same number (-20) while the bot's comment only gets a couple of votes since you replied to them. It's quite obvious they're using bots to spread propaganda to as many subs as possible.</p>

        <p>The latest totally fucking bizarre bot thing I've been seeing is on Facebook. I've been getting random friend requests from people I've never met before. They are all drop dead gorgeous women, and their entire photo set is "I'm vaccinated" and then photos of them either being vaccinated, or talking about how great it is to do stuff while vaccinated. It's the most obvious thing I've ever seen.</p>
