    <strong>I'm starting to wonder if the CDC are really the main villans to this whole pandemic or if they just played a part in this "pandemic"</strong>
    <p><p>I've been recently playing devil's advocate in my head. Mostly how much we should be holding the CDC responsible  for how we got to this point.</p>
<p>Sure the CDC comes out and says what people should be doing to be safe. However, I am at least starting to question if they are really who we should blame for everything. If it were up to me to pick a top list of who's really responsible for restrictions or no restrictions depending on where you live.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Media (News)</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
<li>State Governors</li>
<li>Democrats</li>
<li>CDC</li>
</ol>
<p>You must be thinking I'm crazy to put the CDC last right? Well just hear me out. I personally believe between the Media and Social Media are the two biggest reasons why we are in this mess.</p>
<p>Think about it all what the CDC did was come out with guidelines on how to handle Covid. That's all what they should have been. However, I believe the Media was able to take those guidelines and Covid to create fear for views. This resulted into Covid blowing up on Social Media.</p>
<p>This led to state governors deciding how to handle the situation. With most of them deciding on restrictions and honestly I think it was all based on how the public in their community was reacting to the virus. Hence why states like Texas and Florida reopened. Either the citizens weren't to concerned or they have a lot of retirees that don't use Social Media to weigh in publically on how they feel toward Covid.</p>
<p>The Democrats well they have demonstrated clearly of how they like or want the masks and restrictions around. I've seen so many people say they "don't want to be mistaken as a Republican" in their response to if they were going to remove the mask or not. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong I don't think the CDC is in the right at all. I think the fact they came out with guidelines to be used for political gain was awful. However, I think the real forces behind this pandemic that really pushed things to what they are today was the Media, Social Media, State Governors and Democrats. </p>
<p>Remember Trump wanted to get us back to normal safe AND quickly. He was the one that wanted things to get back to normal by Easter. In fact I have no doubt that this would have been over and he would have been against vaccine passports. </p>
<p>What do you guys think? How much do you think is responsible to what's going on today or how the pandemic played out. Think I'm wrong to say the CDC should be last on the blame list? Again just let me reiterate. I'm not trying to give the CDC a pass here. I'm not trying to say they didn't play a part in this. I'd like to get to the bottom of what really has led to such a wide spread fear to this virus that caused us to need restrictions or mask mandates in the first place.</p></p>
