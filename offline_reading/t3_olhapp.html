        <p>Explain how it's bigoted to draw parallels between similar occurrences in history? Just because the last dehumanization and subsequent murder of people was ethnically motivated, doesn't mean its bigoted to suggest that the obvious dehumanization and segregation of people now is similar.</p>

        <p>I know you're being obtuse, but I'll bite. </p>
<p>Nobody, yet, is being put into 'ghettos' but if you could use your brain, you'd realize that drawing parallels between things doesn't mean everything is going to be identical. However, unvaccinated people will soon be barred from entering restaurants and shops and from using public transportation.  The dehumanization has already started - some people legitimately want us kept away from them at all costs. All because they don't want to be forcibly injected with an experimental shot. Oh, and they're also talking about jailing people for that same thing.</p>

        <p>I am going on very thin ice here but I say it anyway:  The control of the media was to actually fight propaganda. Because back then as it is now big media is controlled by a few powerful people/entities. Basically he was saying all media are lying and to stop that lying he started to fully control the narrative. A better comparison would be if now a strong man would come to power and say all media is lying and starts to ban CNN, MSN, Fox and all other controlled news channels and starts to only allow his narrative. </p>

<p>And I am honest here, sometimes I wish someone would come and stop the media bullshit. I am just not sure what would come after that.</p>

<p>Isn't freedom of press not always prone to get bought up and become a mouthpiece for the powerful over long enough time?</p>

        <p>I really don't know.</p>
<p>First I would have media monopolies recognized as such, and have the court shatter them.</p>
<p>I'm being utopic in a way, but the fact that NewsCorp (Bloomberg), Clear Channel, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and CBS pretty much control everything you watch (TV/Movies), see (Billboards great and small), or hear (Radio) means that if those at the top want a certain message out there they have zero problem making sure it is out there.</p>
<p>I'm guessing you've seen the videos where they cut to each of the Big 4 over the air channels news together and they are saying literally word for word the same thing.</p>
<p>And even if you look at traditional press (aka. Newspapers) they are almost all owned by one of the media companies if not the same one.</p>
<p>And the idea of "Freedom of the Press" had more to do with journalists, and journalism than media. Journalists and newscasters of the past would balk at what we see and read today as news.</p>
<p>Watergate would never happen today as it did back then. As soon as the journalist would have gotten wind of the story his editor would have gotten a call from "Above" to squash it. And if the journalist would have quit and written the article online it would have gotten squashed as "fake news" by the Fact-Checkers (Some who are owned by the monopolies).</p>
<p>I don't know the actual finances of these companies, but I doubt the pharmaceutical companies don't own a shares of the medias, the medias have shares of Big Pharma, and both control lobbyist in DC.</p>
<p>(I'm restricting this to US, but I could do the same for France or the UK. The fact that France Television and the BBC are government owned makes it worst)</p>
<p>Some of it isn't new. Even back then the media might choose to not to report some things. My grandfather was part of that world. He worked both in LA and New York and one time or another, and he had stories (told to him I'm sure) about journalists snapping pictures of pretty women leaving the White House late at night during JFK's presidency. The editors squashed it either because there was no point in setting the US ablaze at the time, or they had gotten a phone call from the White House.</p>
<p>Sorry... Long winded again, and I do not have a proper answer for you. Even if I did I would be able to poke two dozen holes in it with a little more thought.</p>

        <p>Who is the "one party" though? It would have to encompass almost all governments on the world, almost all media on the world, almost all medical and nursing stuff, scientists, doctors etc.</p>
<p>I can understand feeling insecure due to conflicting information which is available everywhere. But I think we can all agree that it is quite difficult to organise huge amounts of people, especially if it has to happen secretly, since this image is implying some form of conspiracy by hinting towards a single party.</p>
