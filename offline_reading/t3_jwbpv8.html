    <p><p>A professional rugby player was just telling me about the introduction of head and shoulder guards a few years back. Apparently, falsely believing themselves protected, players played harder and as a result more injuries began to occur. Can't help thinking of the parallels...</p>
<p>"There is little evidence to show that shoulder pads decrease the incidence of severe shoulder injuries."</p>

<p>"This suggests that while the headguards may not always be effective at preventing concussion, they may be effective at reducing the incidence of the injury. Until World Rugby make effective headguard development a priority, this research demonstrates current headguards are worth considering as they do decrease linear acceleration experienced on impact."</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Padded headgear does not reduce the rate of head injury or concussion. The low compliance rates are a limitation. Although individuals may choose to wear padded headgear, the routine or mandatory use of protective headgear cannot be recommended. </p>
