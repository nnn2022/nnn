    <strong>I am avoiding the vaxxed for this reason......</strong>
    <p><p>I am under a lot of social and other pressures. All my groups are meeting together. I don't mind running into people in stores, I do not know. The majority here are not masked. Because of very bad lungs I do worry about whatever virus is real and spike protein shedding. </p>
<p>All my groups have returned in person. This includes a religious group and hobby groups.</p>
<p>Some groups are requiring masks of the unvaxxed, which bugs me, people will be hugging in the rooms, and eating together and I'll be the pariah. I want to give up masks soon at a certain point too, and believe that wearing one for hours and hours would be near impossible. I have worn masks in grocery stores/other stores and medical appointments for around an hour at a time, but I know multiple hours is impossible. Someone who gives me a ride to one club, asked I wore a mask in his car, I don't see me wearing a mask for 5-6 hours, I have COPD, I just can't. They are vaxxed in this case. I may just tell him, I will spare him the worry and have husband drive me and that we are planning other activities if I do decide to go. </p>
<p>I know people in these groups are wondering now why I am not showing up. I am considering dropping out of everything citing extreme medical problems. [believable in my chronic illness case]</p>
<p>With the liberal church, I was happy there for 5 years, but now, with their embracing of all this, I am not so happy. I already feel like a pariah for my beliefs 'inside". It has massively separated me from them. They require a mask too for the unvaxxed and no eating for the vaxxed while they eat. LOL [guess I would have to take my plate outside, which is kind of sad isn't it?]</p>
<p>They are all meeting, having meals together, etc. I have been invited over to dinner--not a friendship but a church invite, another meal for someone else and have said no to everything. My social life is pretty much dead. </p>
<p>Some may say why isolate yourself, but I feel differently about the people I used to know. It is hard to explain. [Remember I am autistic, I can't keep up pretense very well] I can't talk honestly and openly anymore, I feel like they will be ready to put me on the train for the Fema camp. Even spiritually,  while I think we should treat all with compassion, I feel strong intuition NOT to be around them and yes I feel "mean" but these feelings are coming out of somewhere.</p>
<p>I keep thinking if I hang out with all these people in these formal groups as the ONE 'unvaxxed' person, I am not announcing it but come on they can tell, since I have been wary of returning....I don't want to blamed when the would be ADE, die-off, extreme illness or variants return.</p>
<p>I know there are some rural and other people around here who have refused, I can't be the only one.</p></p>

        <p>Don't put up with anybody who claims to be a Christian and then treats you like a disease. That's the most unchristian point of view that they could have. I'm really sorry you're having to go through this. </p>
<p>People like you're describing are exactly what turned me off of religion.</p>

        <p>For me personally, I would forgo any social outings that divided people like this. As much as I crave and value human interaction I would have to make that distinction. I am extremely fortunate that my church is conservative and my close friends are for the most part not neurotic doomers. </p>
<p>I have declined several events where there was some wording about masking, social, distancing, etc. It's just not worth it.</p>

        <p>Agree. No one's been mean to me, they are kind people but I don't think they thought out the ramifications of the unvaxxed vs vaxxed thing and how that alone is discriminatory. I am getting worried we are the only ones. I drop subtle hints, I said to someone today that there's a point we just need to rejoin regular life despite the risks.</p>
