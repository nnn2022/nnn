    <strong>This was going on since many years.</strong>
    <p><p>This is just the tip of the iceberg, the cherry on the cake.</p>
<p>I had an epiphany yesterday.</p>
<p>This control, censor, brainwash, propaganda was here since many many years.</p>
<p>Innocent people being gaslighted. Cops chasing kids smoking a joint while pedophiles In the upper echelons of society run free and heroin is securely and privately escorted from other states.</p>
<p>Media giving us brain junk, propaganda, tits and violence non stop.</p>
<p>The school trying to kill every single spark of creativity and individuality that there might be in a kid.</p>
<p>This is just the final boom. Of many years of surveillance, lies, control, brainwash, conform, adapt, work til you die, leave your kids in debt.</p>
<p>One good thing about the lockdowns, this is all coming to the surface. The lies, manipulation, control is so so clear now, to many people that even just last year were trusting their governments.</p>
<p>I don't know, I feel that this had to happen. That all this shit would come to a tipping point. And here we are. All in our face, drowning in the shit that has been building up for years.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a sort of vision: this had to happen. One way or another. The road that humans were taking would have led to this. The road that big corps and big gov was taking. </p>
<p>A massive storm of shit is happening in front of our eyes. Many people are deleting their social media accounts. We would have been glued to the phone for the next 60 years if all this shit wouldn't have happened. We would have trusted big pharma. We would have trusted the government. We would have trusted the police. </p>
<p>Now its all here, on the surface, right in front of everyone's eyes to see. And those who can see this, will carry on, with the hope of creating a better world. The ones who cannot see this will drown in a spiral of fear, isolation, hysteria, deception, falseness, hate and dread. </p>
<p>The world is splitting in two. I remember reading an old prophecy about this. That two different worlds will be created and be so distant from each other. Here we are.</p>
<p>I just hope that we will keep carrying on. That this is an opportunity to see what has been going for years. This is not a tragedy, this is an opportunity. You are more powerful than you think you are.</p>
<p>Let's do this. Let's flush this toilet of shit, together.</p>
<p>Much love</p></p>

        <p>Love him or hate him, Trump is the one that exposed all of this and woke many Americans up to it.  Directly and indirectly.  I’ll say it again, love him or hate him, it doesn’t matter, the truth is his presidency was extremely important to the US.</p>

        <p>I don't think people will or even should trust their Republican politicians anymore either unless they know them VERY well, they're likely to stab them in the back</p>
<p>They're likely mostly play-fighting with the Democrats</p>
<p>Or if not, have either been bribed or threatened or blackmailed into compliance</p>
<p>Or maybe incapable of doing much anyway due to the rest having also given in</p>

        <p>Dude</p>
<p>Here's the problem, the Elites all over the world are on average FOR this</p>
<p>Whether they be politicians, businessmen, academics or even celebrities they all help control the narrative</p>
<p>Good luck forming a resistance without much financing or even the ability to communicate and organise</p>
<p>If people are allowed outside en masse, it's only because they were allowed to</p>
<p>People all over the world are being gaslighted into thinking they're crazy for defying or being skeptical, thing about being gaslighted is that odds are you won't have many people to talk to you about it and said people may not defend you from the authorities</p>

        <p>IDK I’m somewhere in the middle. Sometimes I think people are waking up, other days I think we are sinking deeper into our fake reality. Everyday the government’s lies go unchallenged whether it’s about COVID or 9/11 is another day that people teach their children the official government story</p>
