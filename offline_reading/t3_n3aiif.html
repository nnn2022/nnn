    <strong>Setting the precedent of calling something a vaccine that's not.</strong>
    <p><p>We all know that that the Covid Vaccine is a gene therapy and not the traditional type of vaccine. They had to change the definition of vaccine to allow this MRNA therapy to squeeze into that catagory. The reason it had to be in the catagory of vaccine &amp; not treatment is so they could get the liability protection, which was absolutely essential for the manufacturers (we see why, they'd be bankrupt by now from the lawsuits).</p>
<p>The reason why there are more and more vaccines added to the schedule all the time is because it's a gold mine. All profit, no liability. Plus you don't have to pay for advertising, especially it's on the vaccine schedule. The doctors do all the work for you. This is why they are looking to make vaccines for everything you can think of (whether safe &amp; effective or not).</p>
<p>There have even been vaccines in the works for depression and PTSD. How it would work is a virus goes into your brain and eats away at parts of the brain that cause stress &amp; anxiety. What could go wrong!??  Thank God these haven't been mass produced yet (that we know of).</p>
<p>My concern is that drug companies are going to try to pass off other new drugs as "vaccines" like has been done for the Covid vaccine. The goal would be for as many drugs they sell as possible to have liability protection.</p>
<p>We've all seen the commercials for law firms looking for plaintiffs for certain drugs. You never see them for vaccines. Unfortunately, that makes people think they are safe. The real reason is because you can't sue the drug company for a vaccine injury/ death.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in the back of your mind is that when you see these commercials, you are looking at a drug that HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA. So imagine putting something in your body that hasn't been (Covid Vaccine).</p></p>

        <p>To be fair .. FDA`s approval never meant anything .. seeing how many law suits Big Pharma lost in the past years, and how many have died from approved medicine . FDA like EMA are corrupt as any other governmental org, and im sure they will be bought into aproving these vaccines also, maybe sooner than 2023.</p>

        <p>I agree with that. I wouldn't get this vaccine, even if they do approve it. At the end of the day, the FDA are made up of people. People are flawed, compromisable, easily blackmailed/ bribed.</p>

        <p>You got the craft right, but not the artisan.</p>
<p>It's like a software, they start with a bug-some one, let's consider OSes for this analogy, that were first sold with catchy marketing, doesn't come with an undo or uninstall option, however stuck with no better options.</p>
<p>Then regularly checking for new patches/updates becomes life. Patch after patch, old bugs are sealed, however new disruptions occur, and you cannot do simple tasks, even a simple mechanical calculator would do. Eventually arrives the Patch No. 10, with a catch though, patches will now be installed/coerced and files edited without your authorization.</p>
<p>So, an average user is stuck with this awful yet flashy software, and likely cannot afford it's "PRO" version, while losing complete rights to their own system, that is now a leaky pot, regularly leaking everything about their system to third parties.</p>
<p>Our artisan in question has done it before with computers, he sure can do it again with human bodies.</p>

        <p>Oh! You've got my comment wrong. I never said an "mRNA vaccine" will itself be performing "gene-editing". I meant gene-editing and related tech being the cause for all voes, whether it's use in generating new "novel" viruses or to modify crops that may result in genetic damage after prolonged consumption.</p>

        <p>Okay, I was just confused why someone downvoted me. </p>
<p>I still don't understand how something with its genes edited can somehow change my genes though. Natural evolution causes genes to change. Even farmers edited the genes of crops (before knowing what genes were) by selectively breeding larger crops for the past few centuries. </p>
<p>What is the scientific process that allows for the genetics of something else to interact with my genes?</p>

        <p>Well, I'm not into genetic research or am I subscribed to "Science". But if you are asking for factual reasoning, this probably could have something to do with rejection to foreign particles, the same way smoking causes cancer and tumors, and the fact that smokers don't get cancer on their first cigarette, and the fact that not all smokers get cancer, and also the fact that children of some smokers face health issues while their smoking parents may live a long healthy life.</p>

        <p>By scientific process, I meant physical process, like how eating food results in the body absorbing glucose. What is the physical process that makes genes of a food interact with my genes?</p>
<p>Considering your foreign particles thinking, how does the body tell if a normal potato is different from a selectively bred potato? The genes are different, but they both taste the same; the only significant difference is that one is bigger than the other. We've all been eating crops that have been selectively bred, unless you lived in medieval times, yet genetic damage has not been a widespread issue since medieval times.</p>
<p>Could it be possible that this genetic damage is because of something other than the GMO crops? From what I've read about it, the only studies that support GMO crops causing gene damage were only correlational, not causal, meaning it wasn't proven that the GMO crops were the exact reason for the genetic damage. Maybe first-world countries that use GMO crops have some other reason for genetic damage, like radiation from other products (maybe microwaves or something like that)?</p>

        <p>The vaccine includes genetic information (mRNA) about the virus, which the body turns into spike proteins. The body then recognizes these spike proteins and creates antibodies for it. The only difference between the mRNA vaccines and typical vaccines is that it gives the person genetic information about a part of the virus instead of giving the person the actual part of the virus itself.</p>
<p>If you look at the definition of a vaccine, the mRNA vaccines still fit the definition.</p>
<p>The term "gene therapy" is misleading because it makes people think it changes your DNA somehow, which is impossible.</p>

        <p>Hard to tell if I am talking to children online, those with extra chromosomes, paid shills. </p>
<p>ribonucleic acid, a nucleic acid present in all living cells. Its principal role is to act as a messenger carrying instructions from DNA for controlling the synthesis of proteins, although in some viruses RNA rather than DNA carries the genetic information.</p>
<p>RNA carries the genetic information of a virus. We sequence that genetic information. Say it with me, gen-et-ic, we use this viral gen-et-ic information to synthesize proteins. The gen-et-ic information acts as instructions for out gen-et-ic DNA to synthesis protiens to produce an familiar immune response to COVID </p>
<p>So we use the genetic sequence of a virus to provide carrying instruction to out DNA, which is literally out genetic sequence, to synthesis protiens.</p>
