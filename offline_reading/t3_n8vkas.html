        <p>last I heard it was just to get back into the country, but I don't think the vaccine passport is a reality yet so you need a negative test within 72 hours of boarding the plane to Canada and then another one when you land because they don't trust the first one..</p>

        <p>I'm not sure if you can board the plane without the test.. I do know of one guy for sure - and have heard of others - who refused the test when he landed.. then they said he needs to quarantine at his expense  for 10 days at 'a facility' which he politely declined, so they gave him a fine ($800? I can't remember) and went home to quarantine.. he is a Canadian citizen</p>

        <p>No I've been keeping on top of this kind of news constantly and AFAIK no country currently REQUIRES covid vaccination as an entry criteria. No country even reduces their quarantine duration based on vaccination status yet.</p>
<p>Could this happen in the future if / when they get vaccine passports passed? Maybe. </p>
<p>Or maybe they are dangling it as a carrot for suckers to get vaccinated but then it never actually happens and the smug vaxxed people actually get no real travel benefits that they were gloating about, they ruined their health for nothing.</p>
<p>Or maybe only a few countries do it, but then those countries are off my travel list.</p>

<p>Well that explains why you are on this sub in the first place...... also there is a differencce between listening and believing.</p>
<p>&rt;an experimental vaccine for a mild virus</p>
<p>Any vaccine is better than nothing. There are no set standards for needing a vaccine for a virus so threatening. And its mild for you but dangerous for others.</p>
<p>&rt;and then make it mandatory for people to travel with proof of it.</p>
<p>It's not just a single government, you need to get vaccinated to enter almost every country as per THEIR government rules, not just your own (at least in the EU).</p>

        <p>Let me just tell you something real quick, if you want to get a vaccine that hasn’t been tested enough then please go ahead. But for me I just find it odd that out of nowhere some “deadly virus” came into this world and all of a sudden everyone needs to get vaccinated in order to travel to different countries. </p>
<p>Also, if you think this vaccine isn’t forced then why is the media urging us to take the vaccine and why are non scientific people who aren’t doctors or experts explaining the “facts” about this virus. I would rather trust a doctor or scientist who spent years and years studying topics like these over someone like Bill Gates who hasn’t ever graduated.</p>

        <p>There is no set standards for how approved a vaccine has to be when we desperately need it. Why do you find it odd that we get these types of deadly viruses to travel to different countries? Every 50-200 years the human race suffers from a new strand like this, the last one being the spanish influenza in 1912, millions of people died in a matter of weeks because they did not have the technology like we have today to stop it from spreading.</p>
<p>&rt;"why are non scientific people who aren’t doctors or experts explaining the “facts” about this virus."</p>

        <p>Here’s the thing, if you think there is no set standard as to how approved the vaccine has to be then there is something completely wrong here. Also if there is no set standard then why is it that only the top 5 big pharma companies are allowed to make this vaccine. </p>
<p>Please don’t talk about the Spanish flu when it comes to talking about this plandemic. The Spanish flu was a real pandemic which we where able to control within 10 months, with Covid some of your “health experts” are claiming that we may even need to wear this mask all the way up to 2024. Do you call this advancements in technology? </p>
<p>Lastly, I specifically mention Bill Gates because he seems to be the only one in this world trying to prompt this vaccine and if you don’t listen to him then you probably won’t be effected by this plandemic like us. Bill Gates, the man claiming to put our healthcare first is the same person who said that this world is overpopulated and there needs to be some population control.</p>

Do you call this advancements in technology"? </p>
<p>It naturally died out because it evolved to be so dangerous, that after killing tens of millions people started to day faster than it could spread.</p>
<p>“health experts” are claiming that we may even need to wear this mask all the way up to 2024. Do you call this advancements in technology"? </p>
<p>Well yeah, because the information is being spread faster because x (masks) is being more known in what it protects that. And I dont mean just that specigically. If anything, why would it NOT be called an advancement in technology?</p>
<p>&rt;"Lastly, I specifically mention Bill Gates because he seems to be the only one in this world trying to prompt this vaccine and if you don’t listen to him then you probably won’t be effected by this plandemic like us.

<p>Bill gates just funds his vaccine and why shouldnt i listen to him? The world is populated, by 2050 the population will reach 10 billion and we already have almost 2 billion people without full rights to water, food, shelter etc. That number is going to double by then. Besides, this is a completely different topic?</p>
