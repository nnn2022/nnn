    <strong>Oath of Medical Sovereignty</strong>
    <p><p>By Chiron Last, from his video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oT6Fg4lNdoY"><em>"Conversations From The Heart".</em></a></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Oath of Medical Sovereignty</strong>
&rt;
&rt;I make this oath to affirm that health is a sovereign right and therefore an individual responsibility, and that no man or government shall make any law to upend this sovereign right for any reason whatsoever.
&rt;
&rt;I make this oath to never participate in any campaign under the banner of health that omits an individual from being a participating member in the public on the premise of not taking into themselves a product of industry. Any authoritarian mandate of health created to omit an individual from being a public member of their own species is the epitome of medical tyranny.
&rt;
I make this oath to strive for balance within myself, which will be reflected outside of myself. The very definition of health is balance, and just as one must look after their inner environment, so too is it my obligation to take care of the external environment, for they are synonymous. As within, so without.
&rt;
&rt;I make this oath to always look for the root of any and all individual issues and to not simply treat symptoms. Dealing with root causes brings back the natural balance of any system, while dealing with symptoms disguises the imbalances.
&rt;
&rt;I make this oath to uphold the principles of health and medicine to be an individual and sovereign right. Just as there are no two people that are exactly alike, the health and balance of every individual will also never be exactly alike which means that there can never be any “one-size-fits-all” medicines or methods of treatment that can be repeated upon every individual. Complete health is about patience, care, and attention to detail, which cannot be traded for the efficiency, destructiveness, and ruthlessness of industry.
&rt;
&rt;I make this oath to treat myself and others with dignity and care, from my first breath until my last.
&rt;
&rt;I make this oath to treat my individual health for what it is, a natural and sovereign right that cannot be bought or sold.
&rt;
&rt;I make this oath that in the obligation to my own health I shall lead by example instead of by rote, and that I will honor the pillars of health which are balance and stability through the union of all my faculties. These pillars are the foundation of the communion between the body and mind, the heart and soul, the spirit and the creator.
&rt;
&rt;I make this oath to create alleviation instead of pressure, moderation over excess, and empathy over apathy.
&rt;
&rt;I make this oath to recognize the law of rhythm in health. Just as I must breathe in, so must I breathe out. Everything within must be compensated without and the same holds true inversely.
&rt;
&rt;I make this oath to treat my body as sacred, just as I honor the Earth and all living beings as sacred. For my body is the Earth and the Earth is my body.
&rt;
&rt;I make this oath to never inflict any force of will upon any other individual in the name of health or otherwise, just as I honor that same respect which is bestowed upon my own individual sovereignty.
&rt;
&rt;I make this oath to affirm that there are no universal laws, save those that come from God and God alone. It is furthermore recognized that all truth, which includes the foundational principles of health, can only be derived from the Creator of all things both manifest and unmanifest.
&rt;
&rt;I make these oaths to align my body and my spirit with the principles of truth and freedom, for it is seen that without truth and without freedom, there cannot be health. If I do not have freedom of health, I do not have freedom, and if I do not have freedom, I have nothing.
&rt;
&rt;I make these oaths as an unbreakable bond between my body and my mind, my heart and my soul, my spirit and my creator. Nothing and no one that is foreign to this bond may break or disrupt it for any reason whatsoever.</p></p>
