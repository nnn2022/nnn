    <strong>I may have already posted this but check out a letter I wrote to my school board</strong>
    <p><p>People who don’t want kids in school can suck my balls here it is: I just finished my Junior year at Cambridge Rindge and Latin. I’d like to offer a high school student’s perspective on why it’s important that schools return to in person this fall.  I believe that school should be fully in person this fall in Massachusetts for various reasons, and I believe the school closing have caused a lot more damage than many people may think.
    The first issue I’d like to address is remote learning. I’m an A student in general, and I take mostly Honors and some AP classes. In general, I’d say I’m a pretty engaged student. However, I have not felt any motivation to work online. I’ve done the work to avoid failing the quarter, but I put in minimal effort, as it is almost impossible to feel engaged while I’m online. I am not alone in this situation. In fact, up to half of my classmates did not even sign into Zoom meetings. Those who did turned off their mics and cameras and were most likely doing something else. I don’t blame them, as it’s very difficult to get engaged in a lesson on a screen. Even a hybrid fall semester would be detrimental to the education of kids (I’d still greatly prefer hybrid classes to all online). Kids just aren’t going to learn unless classes are taught in person. I’m scared that parents and administrators  have started to think online classes are a long term solution. The people who think that have not attended online high school  classes, and don’t understand that the vast majority of kids cannot succeed this way.
    The second issue I’d like to address is the logistics for families  of in person vs. remote learning and how it’s inequitable for school to be online at all this fall. Parents are going to have to get back to work no matter what. The majority of parents cannot work from home, and it would be unfair to many families for parents to have to babysit kids doing online work instead of doing their own jobs. Legally, kids under 12 cannot be by themselves at home for that long. While 12-18 year olds can legally be by themselves that long, I have no doubts that the majority of teens would end up playing video games or doing something else instead of logging onto classes. As an A student, I’d admit that that’s probably what I’d do. This is why online classes logistically wouldn’t work this fall. Again, hybrid would be better than fully online, but students would likely be only partially engaged.
    My last reason for why high school students should be fully back in school this fall is for mental health reasons. We have suffered enough during this pandemic. Though the first few weeks of missing school were probably fun for kids, it got depressing very fast because we were isolated from our peers. Ever since school shut down, I have been feeling sort of depressed. Kids of all ages, even (or maybe especially) those in high school, need social interactions to develop properly, and the school closures have been bad for our mental and social health. None of the many All the kids in my grade want school to be back this fall, even the kids who don’t like school, because it provides a setting where we can be social. The school closures are simply bad for the mental health of teenagers, and I feel like mental health has not been addressed enough  during this lockdown. 
Lastly, I’d like address the risk of keeping kids online this fall. Keeping kids online and stuck at home is extremely risky in terms of mental heath, and depression in teens is an epidemic in this country that has not been addressed during this time. For those living with guardians over 60, or parents who may be at risk, I think there should be an option to be taught online. The online courses could be taught by the more at-risk teachers. All of the teachers I had this year fully support a return to school and are more than willing to return. I’m fairly certain the majority of teachers want to return to the classroom. Though I support a full reopening, I agree that there should be some precautions, such as masks being worn in school, and desks somewhat spaced apart. I do think that fall sports should happen, but maybe with limited fans, because kids are going to play sports whether we are in school or not. Anyway, thanks for hearing my opinion.  I really hope you strongly consider what I had to say when making decisions  about high school reopening in the Fall. Thank you.</p></p>
