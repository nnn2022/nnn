    <strong>Discussion of WHY?</strong>
    <p><p>Serious question here. Iâ€™ve read everything from the Great Reset, NWO, global power, to forced vaccines for pharma profit, given as reasons why everyone from politicians, global leaders, MSM, etc. have pushed Covid hysteria. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s a conspiracy theory that the powers that be have been cramming fear of this overhyped illness down our throats to gain control. But why? They know that it causes more deaths, suicides, poverty, hunger, untreated diseases, etc. We know they donâ€™t care about the deaths or the side effects of the lockdowns. </p>
<p>I want to know what yâ€™all think is the reason? If you step back and think about 2020 without covid, what does it look like? Possible riots in the spring/summer after George Floyd, but notice how those disappeared when it was hurting politicians for re-election? And to put my tin foil hat on for a moment, there has never been more dialog from top level people on the possible existence of extraterrestrial life (in all seriousness). What about the elections? How would those have gone down without mail-in ballots? The economy?  I canâ€™t wrap my brain around it, and all of the generic explanations of global power and reset just donâ€™t quite do it justice.</p></p>

        <p>So the elite can create a global technocracy where "we own nothing and are happy". It's all about control, and fear is a good way to get the masses to relinquish control and give it to the government. Basically, they're sociopaths who don't see us commoners as human and our lives are disposable in their quest to achieve a NWO.</p>

        <p>I just donâ€™t see how they could ever think that would actually work in a normal scenario. People are dumb, but they arenâ€™t that stupid. I think that people are already starting to realize theyâ€™ve been duped. How will they convince us to own nothing and be happy then? It just doesnâ€™t track long term.</p>
<p>Edit to add: Do they think they will be able to escape to their bunkers? How long do they plan on hiding out?</p>

        <p>People may not be 'dumb' per se but most are VERY susceptible to propaganda especially when it's as sustained as this has been </p>
<p>The masses are being slow-boiled like frogs in pots and conditioned to give away more and more of their freedoms, liberties and lives</p>
<p>I don't see this ending well and I wish I could be more positive - but it's been a YEAR give or take ffs and <em>still</em> many aren't getting it</p>
<p>My mother had actually worked out something is badly amiss but when I spoke to her the other day she was back to NPC mode - seems the 'new variant', new lockdown, new hysteria has finally thrown her back</p>
<p>It's frustrating ðŸ˜”</p>

        <p>It definitely wonâ€™t end well. I think by the time people realize it, itâ€™ll be too late. I feel like we are being primed for something bigger.</p>

        <p>Oh we definitely are...of that you can be absolutely certain</p>
<p>It will only end well if people stand up and <em>make</em> it end, but at this point in time I just don't see it happening unfortunately</p>

        <p>People are happy to rent everything and not own it, they have been for years. As dumb as people are shows, as now would be a great time for 'the peoples great reset:, but nah, we'll all just play along with theirs.</p>
