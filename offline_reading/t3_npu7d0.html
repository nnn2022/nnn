        <p>The virus is real. As mentioned by Dr. Lee Merritt the virus was fairly dangerous within the first few months, as time goes by it becomes weaker (deadliness goes down, but transmissibility goes up - basic evolutionary fitness at work). As Jeff R. Nyquist points out, this is a bioweapon and it was most likely released on purpose. I would highly recommend learning more about these two people. They really know what they are talking about.</p>
<p>Now, why admit the virus was accidentally released from a bio-lab? Because the alternative is to say it was intentionally released - which it was. CNN's propaganda piece on the <em>accidental lab origin</em> is to prevent us from realizing that we are at war with China. China will not suffer <strong><em>military</em></strong> retaliation if the narrative is that of an accidental release. China's release of the virus is an act of war and a crime against humanity. Let's not forget that Xi Jinping once said he admired Hitler, Mao, and Stalin - all of which are mass murderers. Ever wonder why Russia/China and it's allies are all getting non-mRNA vaccines? What happens when most of western military servicemen get vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine that can trigger antibody immune enhancement and kill them from heart failure and sepsis (see Dr. Lee Merritt's binary weapon postulation). This could be triggered by a new virus and would give the perpetrator the perfect alibi, i.e. "a new variant".   Why did Putin recently (a few months ago) flaunt Russia's new nuclear missiles and say that the following years would be decisive? Why did Putin say during a communist youth event, "I am with you"? We owe Joseph McCarthy, Anatoliy Golitsyn, Yuri Bezmenov, among others, and apology for ignoring them all this time.</p>

        <p>Yeah, China forced the drug companies and tech oligarchs to corrupt the government and bring in an obscene fortune in covid profiteering, that makes sense. </p>
<p>Let's not hold the people who actually did this accountable, let's blame China instead, maybe start a war.</p>

        <p>If they’re truly just figuring out that this thing came out of a lab, then they’re truly incompetent.
Of course, we all know that they knew from the beginning where this thing originated. The question is why they’re admitting it now? “Admit that there was a ‘leak’ before they prove that it wasn’t an accident.”?</p>

        <p>Ah yes of course clarifying questions are a sign of a lack of critical thinking. </p>
<p>I merely asked for a clarification because this sub seems often to think this whole thing was an invention of our government and isn’t actually dangerous. </p>
<p>I won’t bother asking next time, I’ll just refer to this comment and assume you’re all petulant fools with a degree in ‘critical thought’</p>

        <p>You think covid isn’t dangerous, but this post claims it came out of a Chinese lab. That’s the only reason I asked. </p>
<p>Those two seem at odds and I was interested in what the original commenter thought about that tension. This post seemed a bit more open to discussion than whatever Facebook memes usually pop up here. </p>

        <p>Both things can be true at the same time. Do you think that a lab means it's ebola level dangerous?</p>
<p>Now I'm actually curious just how little you've thought about this, because it's clear you associate labs automatically with dangerous virii, even though all sorts are studied, including the common cold (also made up of coronavirii) in some labs.</p>

        <p>I thought it was that level 4 biohaz lab in Manitoba where two researchers were given Ye Olde Boot for a) being CCP spies and b) stealing classified data. </p>

        <p>Oh I heard about that. Yeah, I think they even got arrested, right? </p>
<p>If you've got time for a long video podcast, <a href="https://altcensored.com/watch?v=36BRno9Y9E4"><strong>give this a watch</strong></a>. It'll blow your mind. Maybe listen/watch while doing laundry or going out for a walk. </p>
<p>Here's my take of what happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Obama signed-off on a joint partnership between various American labs with Chinese labs based on advice from Fauci (yes that Fauci) to help combat any future pandemics like SARS (I can provide actual sources for this if you want). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The research consisted of studying why bats were a major source of various deadly viruses (yet never suffered from any of these viruses). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fort Detrick, in Maryland, experienced two under-reported leaks in the summer of 2019, which led to it's closure August 2019 (it only re-opened this past March). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Around September to October, major MSM reports of horrible pneumonia-like deaths occur in places around Ft. Detrick, as well as many places along the entire East Coast. These deaths were blamed on vaping, which is bullshit. But anyways one surprising thing is that when doctors took x-rays each victim's lungs showed "ground glass oppacities", which is a common trait among covid-19 patients (and covid-19 wasn't even known back then). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Same month, the inventor of the RT-PCR test, Dr. Kary Mullis (Ph.D), dies of pneumonia-like illness. He was an advent critic of Fauci, and also stated that his invention should never EVER be used to detect for a virus (it can't distinguish between a live or dead one). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One month later, on October 18, 2019, Bill Gates hosts Event 201, where various experts are gathered to see what the planet should do in the event of a world-wide coronavirus outbreak (yes, corona, but not covid-19, but covid is part of the coronavirus family where there are many strains/variants). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then between Oct. 18, 2019 – Oct. 27, 2019 the world Military Games begin in Wuhan, China (yes, that Wuhan). That particular year, the US team performed extremely poorly, with various anecdotal reports that the team seemed sick or had flu-like symptoms. Every year prior to heading out to the World Military Games, the American team always has to leave from Washington D.C. (unknown why or what the significance is), but since so many had to gather there prior to their departure, it's suspected that some athletes may have come from Fort Detrick, or came into contact with military forces who worked there (Ft. Detrick is a large military base with a biolab too). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't have the link yet, but in places like Lombardy, Italy, Wuhan, China, and some places in Iran residents were offered/given a flu vaccine sometime around November, as the flu season was upon them. It's significant why I'm mentioning this, as it'll come back into play later. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reports from as early as late November all the way to the February, the world hears reports of a new pandemic happening in Wuhan, China. Initially fingers pointed to either 1) a leak from the Wuhan biolab, or 2) the wet food market where animals are butchered (I'm no fan of that level of cruelty inflicted upon those poor animals, but this has caused the world to note that China has these open wet food markets where live animals are killed on the spot). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reason why I mentioned about the flu vaccine being given/offered in Nov. 2019 to the aforementioned places like Lombardy, Wuhan and some rural areas in Iran is because those were the only places around the world during the beginning stages of the pandemic where you saw people fall flat to the ground. I suspect (thanks to the work of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ5tehIMxfE"><strong>Whitney Webb</strong></a> ) that these citizens in these respective areas were given something very deadly, like a modified version of fentanyl (undetectable, odorless). No other city in the world at the height of the pandemic (and even to this day) had no one falling face flat onto the ground. And fentanyl can really fuck-up your lungs due to extreme coughing, leaving scars in the lungs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The world locks down, and now well into 18 months into the pandemic, now all the fingers are pointing to Wuhan, and rightly so because I feel the Chinese government has not been open or forthcoming about what occurs at their biolab there. But the Chinese government is asking the Americans to openly discuss what happened at Ft.Detrick. I hope war doesn't break out because of this. Mankind deserves the truth as to what really happened. Our very lives are at stake here.</p>

<p>I still think China is not being forthcoming with what occurred over the years with their Wuhan lab, but the Ft. Detrick angle needs to be looked at as well. </p>
<p>I'll create a post on this as soon as I can. I'm at work right now.</p>

        <p>There's some very good reading from EthicalSkeptic on twitter, where he believes he has evidence showing the wuhan lab had a leak some ~2 years prior, with bad "flu" seasons across asia, tracing the number and genetic derivation of variants (way too many as of nov 2019 to have just released), so many fewer covid cases in 2020 due to prior immunities, etc.  It's pretty compelling and worth a look.</p>

        <p>I’m sympathetic to the idea of pre-existing immunity in Asia, but you’d expect that a virus that spread around an entire continent would have spread across the entire world too.</p>

        <p>I don't disagree, but there was a very severe flu season a couple years back in the US as well which may line up.  Depending how contagious it actually is, and whether sc2 is the same or merely similar to the previous leak would be interesting avenues to pursue.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that none of this is being seriously investigated (or at least shared) at the government level where the best compiled data <em>should</em> exist and we're left with attempts to scrounge together enough data from around the world to build and test hypotheses like these.</p>
