    <strong>What The Science™ doesn't want you to know.</strong>
    <p><h1>You've been deceived by politicians, sellout "scientists" and the corporate media. These "scientists" push the narratives of their sponsors (governments, big corporations, etc.). Remember their "studies" claiming that smoking and high-sugar diets are not harmful? In March 2020, they caused global panic with randomized, pseudoscientific models.</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Asymptomatic transmission is not common at all.</h1>

<h1>Back in March 2020, pseudoscientific models contributed to global panic and lockdowns.</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.aier.org/article/imperial-college-model-applied-to-sweden-yields-preposterous-results/">The ICL (Neil Ferguson) never published their original model regarding their doomsday projection that 2.2 million Americans would die to Covid. It took them 1 MONTH to publish a heavily edited model. This model also "predicted" 96,000 Swedes and 512,000 Brits would die to Covid. In 2001, Neil Ferguson "predicted" 50,000 Brits would die from mad cow disease (only 178 died). He admitted his prediction was inaccurate and now claimed only 88,000 Americans would die. Ignored by MSM.</a></p>

<h1>Masks are useless. Democrats politicized Covid by forcing lockdowns/masks and turning it into a global trend. They knew that politicizing Covid was their only way to the White House.</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html">Cloth masks may be a reminder of the "need" to maintain social distancing. However, they're not PPE and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>

<h1>Believe it or not, social distancing is pseudoscience based on a 14 year old student's high school experiment in 2006. It's also anti-science because it claims staying 6 feet apart protects you from respiratory droplets and aerosols.</h1>

<h1>Covid didn't kill "600,000+ Americans", nor did it cause "mass global excess deaths". People who died "from" Covid were mostly 85-89 years old and suffered from at least three severe comorbidities.</h1>
<p><a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/if-covid-fatalities-were-90-2-lower-how-would-you-feel-about-schools-reopening/">Had the CDC used its industry standard, Medical Examiners’ and Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting Revision 2003, as it has for all other causes of death for the last 17 years, the COVID-19 fatality count would be approximately 90.2% LOWER than it currently is.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://softwaredevelopmentperestroika.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/swe_spot_the_pandemic.jpg">2012 had HIGHER death rates than 2020 (Sweden).</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">The ICD-10 classification for COVID-19 deaths does NOT require a confirmation that COVID-19 was the cause of death.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">Based on the March 2020 revision, even fatal gunshot wounds have been registered as Covid deaths, because the new CDC guidelines require doctors to register any death as Covid if the victim recently tested positive.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">The report regarding that new ICD-10 U07.1 classification also states that confirmation is NOT required: What happens if the terms reported on the death certificate indicate uncertainty? If the death certificate reports terms such as “probable COVID-19” or “likely COVID-19,” these terms would be assigned the new ICD code. It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases. Should “COVID-19” be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test? COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is ASSUMED to have caused or contributed to death. People have died from the same things that they've always died from: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, pneumonia, obesity, medical errors, old age, flu, accidents, etc. Medical errors kill 700,000+ Americans every year.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201126223119/https:/www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19">November 2020: This JHU report was infamous for causing liberal Twitter outrage, and they forced JHU to retract this report. JHU: Surprisingly, the deaths of older people stayed the SAME, BEFORE and AFTER COVID-19. Since COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, experts expected an increase in the % of deaths in older age groups. However, this increase is NOT seen from the CDC data. In fact, the % of deaths among all age groups remain relatively the SAME. This trend is completely contrary to the pattern observed in previous years. Interestingly, as depicted in the table below, the total decrease in deaths by other causes ALMOST EXACTLY equals the increase in "deaths" by COVID-19. This suggests, according to Briand, that the Covid death toll is MISLEADING. Briand believes that deaths due to heart diseases, respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia may instead be RECATEGORIZED as being due to COVID-19.</a></p>

<h1>Lockdowns are destructive and useless. According to Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, medical professor at Stanford University, lockdowns are the biggest public health mistake in history.</h1>
<p><a href="https://thefatemperor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1.-LANCET-LOCKDOWN-NO-MORTALITY-BENEFIT-A-country-level-analysis-measuring-the-impact-of-government-actions.pdf">Lockdowns and wide-spread COVID-19 testing were NOT associated with reductions in the number of critical cases or overall mortality.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://advance.sagepub.com/articles/preprint/Comment_on_Dehning_et_al_Science_15_May_2020_eabb9789_Inferring_change_points_in_the_spread_of_COVID-19_reveals_the_effectiveness_of_interventions_/12362645">Official data from Germany’s RKI agency suggest strongly that the spread of the coronavirus in Germany receded AUTONOMOUSLY. Several reasons for such an autonomous decline have been suggested. One is that differences in host susceptibility and behavior can result in herd immunity at a relatively low prevalence level. Accounting for individual variation in susceptibility or exposure to the coronavirus yields a maximum of 17% to 20% of the population that needs to be infected to reach herd immunity, an estimate that is empirically supported by the cohort of the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Another reason is that seasonality may also play an important role in dissipation.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02090">A Bayesian inverse problem approach applied to UK data on COVID-19 deaths and the disease duration distribution suggests that infections were in decline BEFORE full UK lockdown (24 March 2020).</a></p>
<p><a href="https://advance.sagepub.com/articles/preprint/Comment_on_Flaxman_et_al_2020_The_illusory_effects_of_non-pharmaceutical_interventions_on_COVID-19_in_Europe/12479987">In a recent article, Flaxman et al. allege that non-pharmaceutical interventions imposed by 11 European countries saved millions of lives. We show that their methods involve CIRCULAR REASONING. The purported effects are pure artefacts, which CONTRADICT the data. Moreover, we demonstrate that the United Kingdom’s lockdown was both SUPERFLUOUS and INEFFECTIVE.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://thefatemperor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6.-PREPRINT-LOCKDOWN-ADDED-LITTLE-OR-NOTHING-PROF-BEN-ISRAEL.pdf">Some may claim that the decline in the number of additional patients every day is a result of the tight lockdown imposed by the government and health authorities. Examining the data of different countries around the world casts a heavy question mark on the above statement. It turns out that a similar pattern – rapid increase in infections that reaches a peak in the sixth week and declines from the eighth week – is common to all countries in which the disease was discovered, regardless of their response policies.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078717v1">Comparing the trajectory of the epidemic before and after the lockdown, we find NO evidence of any discontinuity in the growth rate, doubling time, and reproduction number trends. Extrapolating pre-lockdown growth rate trends, we provide estimates of the death toll in the absence of any lockdown policies, and show that these strategies might NOT have saved any life in western Europe. We also show that neighboring countries applying less restrictive social distancing measures (as opposed to police-enforced home containment) experience a very similar time evolution of the epidemic.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.26.20202267v1">Allowing for heterogeneity reduces the estimate of ‘counterfactual’ deaths that would have occurred if there had been no interventions from 3.2 million to 262,000, implying that most of the slowing and reversal of COVID-19 mortality is explained by the BUILD-UP OF HERD IMMUNITY. The estimate of the herd immunity threshold depends on the value specified for the infection fatality ratio (IFR): a value of 0.3% for the IFR gives 15% for the average herd immunity threshold.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047860v3">A nationwide lockdown is expected to save on average 274 (median 124, interquartile range (IQR): 71-221) lives compared to the ‘testing, tracing, and isolation’ approach (Israel). However, the ICER will be on average $45,104,156 (median $ 49.6 MILLION, IQR: 22.7-220.1) to prevent ONE case of death.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2652751/">Reducing the risk that each member of a community will be exposed to a pathogen has the attendant effect of increasing the average age at which infections occur. For pathogens that inflict greater morbidity at older ages, interventions that reduce but do not eliminate exposure can paradoxically INCREASE the number of cases of severe disease by shifting the burden of infection toward older individuals.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cesifo/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cesifo/ifab003/6199605">Comparing weekly mortality in 24 European countries, the findings in this paper suggest that more severe lockdown policies have NOT been associated with lower mortality.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3543">President Aleksander Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, has refused to impose a lockdown, close schools, or cancel mass events like the Belarusian football league or the Victory Day parade. Yet the country’s death rate is among the lowest in Europe—just over 700 in a population of 9.5 million with over 73,000 confirmed cases.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604339/full">Stringency of the measures settled to fight pandemia, including lockdown, did NOT appear to be linked with death rate. Countries that already experienced a stagnation or regression of life expectancy, with high income and NCD rates, had the highest price to pay. This burden was not alleviated by more stringent public decisions. Inherent factors have predetermined the Covid-19 mortality: understanding them may improve prevention strategies by increasing population resilience through better PHYSICAL FITNESS and IMMUNITY.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/states-coronavirus-restrictions/73818">The graphics reveal NO relationship in stringency level as it relates to the death rates, but finds a clear relationship between stringency and unemployment.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00779954.2020.1844786">Lockdowns do NOT reduce Covid-19 deaths. This pattern is visible on each date that key lockdown decisions were made in New Zealand. The apparent ineffectiveness of lockdowns suggests that New Zealand suffered large economic costs for little benefit in terms of lives saved.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ssbhalla.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lockdowns-Closures-vs.-COVID19-Covid-Wins-Nov-4.pdf">For the first time in human history, lockdowns were used as a strategy to counter the virus. While conventional "wisdom", to date, has been that lockdowns were successful, we find NOT one piece of evidence supporting this claim.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.20160341v3">Inferences on effects of NPIs are non-robust and highly sensitive to model specification. Claimed benefits of lockdown appear GROSSLY EXAGGERATED.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.28.20248936v1">Our analysis shows that while infection levels decreased, they did so before lockdown was effective, and infection numbers also decreased in neighbour municipalities without mandates (Denmark).</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-3025-y">However, here we use simulations with the original model code to suggest that the conclusions of Flaxman et al. with regard to the effectiveness of individual NPIs are not justified. Although the NPIs that were considered have "indisputably" contributed to reducing the spread of the virus, our analysis indicates that the individual effectiveness of these NPIs CANNOT be reliably quantified.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84092-1">A recent mathematical model has suggested that staying at home did NOT play a dominant role in reducing COVID-19 transmission. The second wave of cases in Europe, in regions that were considered as COVID-19 controlled, may raise some concerns. Our objective was to assess the association between staying at home (%) and the reduction/increase in the number of deaths due to COVID-19 in several regions in the world…. After preprocessing the data, 87 regions around the world were included, yielding 3741 pairwise comparisons for linear regression analysis. Only 63 (1.6%) comparisons were significant.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/15/e2019706118">Previous "studies" have claimed that shelter-in-place orders saved thousands of lives, but we reassess these analyses and show that they are NOT reliable. We find that shelter-in-place orders had NO detectable health benefits, only modest effects on behavior, and ADVERSE effects on the economy.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/biom.13462">What the results show is that, in the absence of strong assumptions, the currently most reliable openly available data strongly suggest that the decline in infections in the United Kingdom began BEFORE the first full lockdown.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~allen/LockdownReport.pdf?">An examination of over 80 Covid-19 studies reveals that many relied on assumptions that were FALSE, and which tended to OVERESTIMATE the benefits and UNDERESTIMATE the costs of lockdown. As a result, most of the early cost/benefit studies arrived at conclusions that were REFUTED later by data, and which rendered their cost/benefit findings INCORRECT. Research done over the past six months has shown that lockdowns have had, AT BEST, a MARGINAL effect on the number of Covid-19 deaths.</a></p>

<h1>Covid vaccines are in Phase III till October 2022 (Moderna) and January 2023 (Pfizer). Unlike traditional vaccines, they don't prevent transmission. They don't immunize you either. Delta UPDATE: My prediction turned out to be true as the majority of cases are among the VACCINATED right now. Why don't we have vaccinated people who contract measles? Hint: MMR is a traditional vaccine.</h1>
<p><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6247/461.full">Vaccines have saved millions of human lives, but according to evolutionary biologist Andrew Read they sometimes may also cause pathogens to turn deadlier. Read first put forward the theory 15 years ago. Now, in a new paper, he presents evidence that that is what happened with the virus causing Marek's disease, an infectious disease in chickens. Read acknowledges that the effect has never been seen with human vaccines, but he argues that future vaccines that prevent disease rather than infection could have the same effect. Other researchers say that no general conclusions should be drawn from the paper. Even if he turns out to be right, the study offers no support whatsoever for those who oppose vaccination, Read stresses. If "leaky" vaccines are proven safe and effective, they should be used, he says, but perhaps with closer monitoring and additional measures to reduce transmission, such as bed nets for malaria.</a></p>
