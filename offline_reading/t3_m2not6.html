        <p>Abridged pandemic hours for stores need to fuck right on off. First of all, how does tightening your hours, causing people to funnel in over a shorter time span, make any sense for mitigating viral exposure? I was at a store that used to open at 8am, now doesn’t open until 11. I forgot and at 10:30 sat in the parking lot Waiting for it to open. I looked around and noticed tons of other people were doing the same. So instead of all of us going in and out getting our shopping done at that time we are now all waiting to go in at the same time when it opens, and then you have the additional people who are coming at 11 AM. Secondly, I like to get my errands done early in the morning so I have the rest of the day to get other things done, but now I have to wait until almost lunchtime to get anything done.</p>

<p>It doesn't make any sense - they are using COVID to cut hours and save money. I feel the same way when I call a business and I get the automated "due to the COVID-19 pandemic, you may experience longer wait times" - yeah...longer hold times have nothing to do with COVID. You drastically cut your staff because you saw an opportunity to save money and blame a virus.</p>

        <p>i'm a mission essential employee and my employer (a very large nameless federal department, lol) is giving everyone in my office the vaccine at work. that's great! the only problem is that we can only get the Pfizer vaccine, and the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot is unavailable. it's nearly impossible in my state (Virginia) to get an appointment at CVS or Walgreens for the J&amp;J vaccine, and it's honestly stressful trying to deal with booking one at work. the clinic at work said they won't even be offering the J&amp;J shot here, because those will be shipped overseas (blah blah blah logistics).</p>
<p>PRO TIP: if one in three people in your workplace are passing on the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines because they have valid concerns about the mRNA technology, but most of those people say that they would take the J&amp;J vaccine, why the fuck aren't you trying to get as many J&amp;J shots into the building as freaking possible?!</p>
<p>i passed on the Pfizer shot because i'm a perfectly healthy 36 y/o woman with no pre-existing conditions, and my husband and i are actively trying to conceive. i don't know if the mRNA vaccines are safe for women who are TTC, who are pregnant, or breastfeeding. i'm not listening to Alex Berenson, i'm listening to the CDC and NHS literally say, "well, we don't know that it's *not* safe for pregnant women, it might be fine! it might not be! fuck around and find out!" </p>
<p>i'm not anti-vaxx by any stretch of the imagination, but the technology behind Moderna/Pfizer is completely new, and it is touching your DNA/RNA. that doesn't sound particularly safe for women who are trying to conceive. look, if i got the vaccine, and then i got pregnant and miscarried, or my child came out with awful birth defects or was stillborn, and in 5-10 years we learn that the mRNA vaccine caused this, i would never ever forgive myself. it's hard enough to get pregnant after age 35 without worrying about my body REJECTING the placenta.</p>
<p>my husband was like, "you fucking moron, just get the bloody shot, it's fine, get out of your heard!" WELL IT'S NOT YOUR UTERUS, ASSHOLE, IT'S NOT YOUR BODY GROWING A POTENTIAL LIFE. IT'S NOT YOUR FETUS UNTIL IT COMES OUT OF MY SACRED PLACE AND THEN I WILL CONSIDER GRANTING PARENTAL RIGHTS.</p>
<p>thanks for listening to me vent. i'm stressed out at work. i feel like i'm not being a team player. but my body is a fucking temple and i'm not going to voluntarily create a hostile environment for my future children just for the sake of some old people in nursing homes and obnoxious Karens. MY BODY MY CHOICE.</p>

        <p>Your husband said that to you? I couldn't have kids with a man like that. What if he decides you're too much of a "moron" and wants a divorce and to take the kid(s)? Even if he can't, he can still make your life miserable. It's none of my business, but reading that upset me and makes me happy to already be divorced from a man I coparent well with and who would never speak to me that way.</p>

        <p>of course that isn't how he speaks to me, but he's also a very "well, the scientific consensus seems to be coalescing around this..."  so in his mind, if the CDC says, "hey go get your shot!" that must mean it's 100% safe.</p>
<p>and while he's very anti-lockdown and anti-new normal, he is itching to get his vaccine so he can get back to living his life. last night he also told me he's a bit jealous that i'm in group 1B because that means i can get vaccinated and get on with it. i think there is some jealousy and frustration there. he can't go back into work until he's vaccinated, and he has no idea when he will be vaccinated so he can go back into his office. but is wife gets a shot and she passes it up and she still gets to go in every day? i'm not justifying it, but i can tell you i understand that chaotic energy.</p>
<p>it does take two people to make a child, and even at our age, most men just don't know enough about pregnancy to have an informed opinion about it. i'm not the best at talking about my fears because i like to put on a strong showing - he was surprised that i was scared. after this morning, i sent him an email with the most current CDC and NHS guidance to give him something to chew on, and he said he honestly had no idea, and understood why i might be hesitant. miscarriage, stillbirths, and birth defects hadn't crossed his mind.</p>
<p>he's comfortable with waiting for the J&amp;J vaccine, and so am i. i'm obviously going to be actively seeking it out, i'm just hoping it comes to my building sooner rather than later. i didn't mean to make him sound like an asshole.</p>

        <p>i talked to my GP about it last week, and he recommended the J&amp;J shot for any healthy person under the age of 60, pregnant or not pregnant or trying. he said it's really the best, easiest, most effective option. it's like a traditional flu shot, which i get every year.</p>
<p>i asked about Moderna/Pfizer, and he said that since pregnant women weren't included in the trials and it is a new kind of vaccine technology (actually, he called the mRNA vaccines "gene therapy"), he said he couldn't tell me to get it. he wouldn't talk me out of it if i wanted it, but he wouldn't talk me into it either. he told me to error on the side of caution and wait for J&amp;J. and he said trials in pregnant women take two-three years, so everyone will really need to be patient.  if you're young (under age 50) and healthy, there's no reason to jump at the mRNA series.</p>
<p>my ob/gyn also errored on the side of caution and flat out said no, didn't recommend. there's too much at stake and it is very very risky, especially during the first and third trimester. we also don't know about any associated birth defects and we won't know if the kids are really alright for another ten years or so. she also told me to "mask up! stay home! save lives!" until everyone else is vaccinated and wasn't sure why i need to be in the office every day. </p>
<p>(i think i'm going to find a new ob/gyn, but not because of the vaccine business, but because they're very into hospital births, and i'm pretty set on a home birth. although tbh knowing myself, i will probably pop my future crotch dumpling out at work as i check my email one last time before my two-week maternity leave.)</p>
<p>tl;dr: this is fucking terrifying, and there should be better, clearer guidance out there for women who are TTC, newly pregnant, super pregnant, or breastfeeding. if they can tell you not to smoke or drink when you're preggo, they can tell you it's okay to not get an experimental shot.</p>

        <p>For the record: J&amp;J is not like a flu shot, it’s an adenovirus vector vaccine. It injects DNA for the spike protein into the cell for it to manufacture. So it’s like the RNA vaccine, but with a different delivery method.</p>

        <p>My boyfriend is British, I'm German. Last time I got to see him was November. It is currently illegal to travel from Britain at all, and if I were to travel there (I can't because relationships are nOt EsSeNtIaL like yeah, tell that to my fucking depression lol I need a goddamn hug more than anything) I'd have to pay upward of 200 £ for a testing kit on top of the 200€ to fly at all.</p>
<p>I'm so fucking done. My mental health is in shambles. At what point is it enough? At what point is it over? Are we just going to do this every fucking year now during flu season? I don't want to fucking live anymore. Uni is impossible for me via distance. My father might lose his job. I lost my first job. I hate the governments so goddamn much.</p>

        <p>One more vent for today. I'm in Ontario and much of the province has started opening up. But it seems the last couple of days, cases have gone up. Of course this means nothing, there's plenty of other variables to consider, and all other metrics are still plummetting. </p>
<p>But that hasn't stopped the media and a good chunk of the population to immediately start screaming "See it was too soon, it's the third wave! Lockdown again!"</p>
<p>I don't even know what I'm going to do if things go back on lockdown here.</p>

        <p>I am also starting to feel like I am going insane. I want to be honest towards myself and accept these measures if they were to have a net positive effect. However, I can't for the life of me figure out how people can come to the conclusion that this would be the case. Am I missing something here? How can the people that are clearly more intelligent than me be under the impression that locking up society for over a year is going to do more good than bad. This is an honest question and I would really like to know.</p>

        <p>I swear man. You can’t get a mother fucking break in this fucking bullshit pussified society. My mother fucking HOA is on my ass for my work van and boat parked in the driveway. First the mother fuckers said I can’t park it in the street... ok... then they say I need to put a fucking cover on it. (All the other fucking trucks and enclosed trailers on my block don’t have one but because I have a fucking van). So I cover it up... which is a PITA to fucking put a tarp on it and take it off every time I need to fucking drive.</p>
<p>Well the mother fuckers send me a letter today that I need the van AND THE BOAT (which they never had an issue with) “out of sight” which basically means either get rid of it or store it somewhere and buy another fucking vehicle to get to where it’s being stored. I’m poor mother fuckers how am I supposed to do that?</p>
<p>I swear... being self employed or doing ANYTHING outside the box, society will shit on you and make your life more difficult every fucking chance these cock sucking mother fucking sick cunts will get. </p>
<p>One day I’m moving to the fucking boonies, and I can’t wait to be away from all these nagging pieces of fucking SHIT CUNTS!! FUCK SOCIETY, FUCK HOAS, and FUCK POINTLESS FUCKING RULES!!! BLOOD SUCKING MOTHER FUCKING CUNT PIECES OF FUCKING SHIT!!!! Can’t give a mother fucker a break nowadays!!!</p>

I kept my lawn and outside of my house pristine yet I got letters from them on the placement of my trash can. "Can't be visible from the street." Well, funny enough 2 of the 3 on the board kept theirs in their driveway with no repercussions. Rules for thee, not for me.</p>

        <p>That's it, I've tried my very damndest to get my folks/wider family to, if not see that this isn't the next Black Plague, to at the very least, not to sacrifice themselves to their god of big pharma/government by playing Russian Roulette with their lives, but to no avail. In fact, there's a not-zero chance that they'll disown me for my "conspiracies" and "selfishness" in the coming year(s).</p>
<p>I already burned a lot of bridges by both being one of the original Obama haters (WAY before it was cool, mind you) and my measured defenses of Orange Emmanuel Goldstein and suggesting that the "deplorables" may not all be marauding, inbred Klansmen. Saying what I REALLY think of Big Sis Kamala could very well be the straw that breaks the camel's back, IDK.</p>
<p>Even my dad, the one individual I'd considered more levelheaded and reasonable, encouraged by his stupid fucking "friends" I'm sure, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDXG-dHugc">literally became this guy</a> after a funeral. I don't even need to say what they claim his friend died of, because you and I already fucking know.</p>
<p>The point is NOTHING I could say or show them at this point would work or even make a dent in their Mockingbird-induced stupor. My cousin literally comes to visit us muzzled. She's fucking 30! These people seriously believe that they're saving lives and that those "anti-maskers/vaxxers" are literal murderers.</p>
<p>Ironically, the one person I've bitched about a lot here (and there are problems with him, for sure) I'm not overly worried about is my little brother. HE was actually the one who started talking about big pharma carrying out mass human experimentation even before I did and when I described the fundamentals of the Great Reset (literal serfdom for the 21st century and beyond), he was horrified by it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel like I'm one of those passengers in first class on the Titanic surrounded by people who don't give a fuck that the plebs are already drowning while our feet are already wet. When I bring up this fact, they just come back with bullshit about how "the experts" say the ship is "unsinkable." At this point, I feel like I can't really do anything else but shake my brother's hand, wish him godspeed, and try to save myself.</p>
<p>Thanks for hearing me out.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry but you people are so wrong and come off as literally retarded to put it bluntly, im 23 and healthy/fit. Got covid a couple weeks ago, it hit my lungs severely, oxygen dropped to dangerously low levels, where I could barely move, chose not to go the hospital because I know over 5 people including family. who died when their ventilators where removed.
I made the right choice, my immune system kicked it very quickly, but it got severe quick before my immune system did its thing.</p>
<p>I've all but cleared the virus for over almost 2 weeks, and to this day. I can hardly breathe.  I struggle to breathe day and night now.</p>
<p>My only pre existing condition was very mild asthma when I was younger. And now I struggle for oxygen.
I have no agenda but I see you all dishing out utter false stupidity and it's cringe worthy, you. Baboons dont realize there are entities who want to downplay the virus, and youre all eating up their propaganda, they don't want people to learn the true origins of this virus so they allow subs like this to downplay it. It's the very reason Trump downplayed the virus for so lung, is was to have a greater more severe impact on his conservative minded followers, who were the primary target of covid. So stop being sheep and think for yourselves.</p>

        <p>You see, here's the thing...</p>
<p>If we assume you are telling the truth about every facet of your experience, and that you haven't downplayed any pre-existing conditions that you had/have...</p>
<p>then there still remains the fact that you'd represent such a <em>tiny minority</em>, similar to people who vent about being paralyzed while scuba diving as a tourist, that although to you, your situation sucks, etc, you still are that <em>tiny minority</em>.</p>
<p>So do you think it is proportional to decimate the lives of most of the world's entire population by overplaying the virus (again, you are the <em>minority</em>, remember) to the extent that civilisation was changed forever overnight?</p>
<p>I'd genuinely like an intelligent response.  I'm disappointed that I find it so unlikely I'll get one.</p>

<p>Y'all know that it would be nearly impossible to get every qualified pandemic/epidemic expert and doctor to lie about the virus? And there is direct evidence that covid is a serious threat to much of the global population? And already more than a million people have died as a result of the virus? And that taking the vaccine is far safer than letting the virus just do its thing unimpeded? </p>

        <p>Yeah, it's just that all the data seem to indicate that the median mortality is somewhere between 0.1 and 0.2%, which BTW is lower than the risk of you dying in a car crash over the span of your life if you're actually driving, and nobody really knows what the side effects of experimental vaccines are, because you know, they're experimental.</p>

        <p>Whilst for you the chances of death or serious harm are low that isn't the case for everyone else, some people such as the elderly are far more likely to have serious effects. More than 2.5 million people have died remember.</p>

        <p>This is absolutely false. Here, read the paper discussing it: https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/99/1/20-265892/en/</p>
<p>And before you'll start crying it's fake news or whatever, note it was published by the WHO</p>
<p>Also, yes, there are people with relatively high risk, but then again they know who they are, and they can absolutely avoid contact with the virus. It's up to them, just like it's up to me to check my ropes before I'll start climbing</p>

        <p>Yep, the WHO says that and I believe they are right. As a general rule, I'd trust pretty much anything the WHO says. </p>
<p>My point wasn't that mortality rate is high because that's plain wrong as you know, the mortality rate is minuscule, my point was that some people don't have the perfect immune system to handle it the virus like you and I do. For example my great nan who is 89 has some immune deficiency condition i don't remember the name of, we've been told by multiple doctors that she'd be looking at serious problems if she got the virus due to the combination of her age and condition, it's been nearly a year since I've seen her. So sure, for majority of us this isn't an issue but not everyone</p>

        <p>No one needed to lie about respiratory infections. I believe they are the third leading cause of death in the elderly. This particular virus was the triple threat: it was new, so humans had no previous exposure; it was highly communicable; and it generally didn't affect healthy young people, so it could move silently through a population.</p>
<p>I'm glad that you trust getting the shot. I don't. I was happy that I got covid in January, because I trust a naturally-occurring mild virus more than I trust entering Phase Four of a vaccine trial.</p>

        <p>They wouldn't have needed more than the few months it would have taken to spread it to the groups whose risk of death and/or severe symptoms was astronomically low: children, young people, and the healthy folks under 50. Last time I checked, a child's risk was about 0.00003, and it remains close to that for all age groups till you hit 65.</p>

        <p>You're right. That's unfair. Let's make the entire world population quarantine. Even if it means they're ignoring their mental and physical health, dying at higher rates from substance abuse, living with an abuser, committing suicide etc.
At least it will make the old folk feel better. 😐

        <p>Yes old people should get the vaccine. If the covid vaccine prevents the risk of contracting the virus and old people are most likely to die from contracting it, they should be vaccinated. But the vaccine is not FDA approved. And as someone who is not in a high risk category I feel better taking a vaccine that is FDA approved with documented long term effects. I am not vaccinated, and I feel comfortable visiting my 85 year old grandfather because he is vaccinated. So why should I take something I don't need if my chances of dying from covid are extremely low and the high risk age groups are less likely to get it now?</p>

        <p>You keep saying "the rest of their lives."</p>
<p>I keep saying "until it spreads to all the young healthy folks."</p>
<p>These two phrases aren't comparable. </p>
<p>Once we have enough people who have either gotten infected and developed antibodies, or have gotten a shot that helps their immune system recognize the protein spikes on the virus when they get infected, the chain of transmission will be broken and the outbreaks will end.</p>

        <p>Have you ever reached out to an actual doc and asked for a recent update? You are still stuck in March 2020. Ive recently spoke to a doc and not only is it treatable, the deaths and cases have dropped dramatically. Where I live, they haven't had a covid patient stay over night in the hospital for over two months, and haven't had a positive case in the emergency room at that time in over two weeks. That was a week ago. </p>
<p>Maybe try talking to people who actually do the job treating those who are sick?</p>

        <p>Where you are in the world isn't in the same situation as everywhere else. What about when travel opens back up and people from countries with thens of thousands of active cases visit your area and spread it again? Are we just going to have all our borders shut to travel forever?</p>
<p>And yeah, I've spoken to experts, one of my closest friends parents is in the national diseases authority or whatever it's now called</p>

        <p>True. She isn't treating sick people, she's collating data and seperating fact from fiction and passing this onto doctors who are helping sick people so those doctors can make proporly informed decisions.</p>
<p>Your doctor doesn't know everything (nobody does obviously) and your doctor can't give treatment if they don't even know what to treat and how to treat it, that's not their responsibility to figure out on their own.</p>
