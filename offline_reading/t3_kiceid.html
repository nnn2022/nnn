    <strong>Does anyone want to debate this topic, and maybe convince someone who isn’t fully convinced that it’s possible?</strong>
    <p><p>I see all kinds of posts on here that are really interesting. There are a lot of claims on here and pictures and stuff like that, but not really much hard evidence proving anything. I’ve never believed in anti-mask because most of the points made against masks can be easily disproven. But I’m interested to see if maybe there is some actual hard evidence out there that can outweigh the evidence against these beliefs. I’m an open minded person, and I want to believe what’s true. Both sides of this debate claim that they are the ones that are right and I want evidence for both sides so that I can make the decision whether or not this is what I want to believe in. I would prefer if these discussions would have no upvotes or downvotes, simply a calm and mature debate so that all the points can be put out there, I’m genuinely interested in this</p></p>

        <p>&rt;I’ve never believed in anti-mask</p>
<p>Think about what you are saying for a moment. You are now so trained by the Hypochondriacs, that you view wearing a mask as normal, and people who want to live normally as "Anti-Mask".</p>
<p>You should also consider that by focusing on the Mask only, you are completely ignoring the millions of people who were labeled "Non-Essential" and thrown into poverty over the last 10 months.</p>
<p>Isn't ignoring those millions of people a pretty crappy thing to do?</p>
<p>&rt;I’m an open minded person, and I want to believe what’s true. </p>
<p>What seems true to me is that you and millions of others have been conditioned. And you are so conditioned, you won't even bring up things that you MUST know to be true. You <em>must</em> know that millions lost their jobs due to these policies. You must <em>know</em> all the ways in which this change ion society has harmed the people under 70 who are 99.9% likely to survive covid.</p>
<p>But you just focus on the "Crazy Anti-Mask People" argument, like you have been conditioned to.</p>
<p>Next time you are around a bunch of Pro-Maskers, try to discuss those Millions of people whose lives were destroyed. See if it is a discussion, or a topic they all ignore.</p>
<p>Or even better - they rationalize throwing millions into poverty because "I would give them even more free government money!"... because they somehow imagine a world where these people get tons of free money - the fact that they took their jobs and threw them into poverty doesn't count.</p>
<p>Think about how strange it is to absolve themselves of any wrong doing because they would imagine everyone getting free money... even though they aren't getting it.</p>
<p>Now look at the "Science". Does the science say that the virus is super deadly for people under 70? Since many people over 70 are retired anyway, why are we shutting down society? Why aren't we just focusing on sheltering those who are scientifically most susceptible? Wouldn't it be much easier, from a government standpoint, to focus on that part of the population rather than every man woman and child who have a 99.9% survival rate.?</p>
<p>What exactly is the "Science" behind the strategy?</p>
<p>&rt;I’m genuinely interested in this</p>
<p>I hope you ask more questions and drop the "Just Wear A Mask" argument.</p>

        <p>The lockdowns have undisputedly caused more harm and death than they have saved. Tens of millions children at increased risk of starvation due to global supply chain disruption. Malaria, HIV, Tuberculosis deaths will all be much higher than normal this year and the next couple. </p>
<p>In the developed world the percentage of people who have considered Suicide over a one month period has gone from 1-2% to 24%. The number of people who found out they had cancer in 2020 is 80% lower than in 2019. We didn’t cure cancer, these people will find out much later than they otherwise would have making their cancer far more dangerous. </p>

        <p>Most of the claims against masks can be disproven?  The danish study showing they don't protect you?  The CDC meta-analysis showing no impact?  Charts like https://principia-scientific.com/charts-the-masked-up-lockdown-lovers-cant-explain/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+psintl+%28Principia+Scientific+Intl+-+Latest+News%29 showing zero correlation between masking and lockdown stringency with cases or mortality rates?</p>
<p>Given coronaviruses are spread predominantly by aerosols, most masks are not tightly woven enough to actually filter those particles, and those that are tend to either not seal to the face at all, or be VERY difficult to correctly seal.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Surgical masks are only designed to keep the wearer's droplet emissions out of patients.  They do nothing for inhaled or emitted aerosols.</li>
<li>Cloth masks are like trying to stop bees with a volleyball net.  There's a mesh there, but it's too wide.</li>
<li>N95s ARE designed to protect the wearer, but healthcare personnel get trained on how to fit them and tested regularly to make sure they're getting a good seal.  Too much moving your face or neck, talking, any facial hair, etc., and you're getting blow-by, which means the air is going around the filter, not through it.  Find someone (other than me) who has done N95 fit tests, ideally with a device that literally counts blown-by particles, and ask how careful you have to be when fitting or wearing one to keep those counts down.  Not to zero, that's essentially impossible, but low enough to pass the test.</li>
<li>None of these masks are designed to contain the pressure from a cough or sneeze, so the pressure all vents around the sides and in to the air.</li>
<li>You can't wear something like a HEPA filter, because your diaphragm can't actually pull air through those without a ton of effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, given all that, and past (pre 2020) studies from WHO/CDC concluding masks by the general population shouldn't be recommended for lack of efficacy, where is the evidence that masks work in a real-world setting?  Lab conditions showing reduction of particles are great and all, professionally fitted on a plastic mannequin, worn once and discarded, etc., but worn by actual untrained masses in realistic situations, where is the evidence that this can significantly impact the spread of disease?  All you'll find are weak correlations from the spring-&rt;summer, some of which were literally retracted when fall hit and cold season returned.  The purely correlative results don't match the new data.</p>

        <p>So I’m seeing your main point in all of these points is how masks don’t completely prevent the spread of particles. The thing is, no one claims that they do. Even if they don’t filter air as well as HEPA filters or other bigger air filters, they still help. They still filter the air at least a little bit and prevents the spread of larger particles of things like saliva while talking and even if it doesn’t completely stop air flow, it definitely slows it down. If you’re standing six feet away from someone and talking to them through a mask, your breath isn’t going to reach them like it would if you were two feet away talking with no masks. The main thing for me is that countries that <em>are</em> following mask mandates, social distancing mandates, and quarantine mandates, are doing a <em>lot</em> better than we are. Look at Switzerland or other European countries. They’re loosening up on their restrictions, while we continue to make ours stricter, because we need to. More and more people are get infected, right before the vaccine came out, there were upwards of 3500 people being diagnosed daily for COVID in just America alone. That’s crazy! And in other countries where people are following mandates, their numbers are going down, as ours continue to rise</p>

        <p>Do you have any evidence of masks helping while standing 6ft away, or just trusting what you deem is common sense? Droplets aren't the issue here, nor are asymptomatics. Even if masks helped in these cases, which still lacks any evidence, they're not significant at population scale.</p>
<p>Cherry picking a few countries, compares to others without masks, is not how science works either. Broadly, when lots of countries and states are compared, there's no statistical significance in the application or timing of mask mandates. If you see a couple outliers, you have to figure out the real reason for the difference in data, and it's actually extremely difficult. If it's obvious to you, you're probably wrong. Are the case and fatalities being counted the same way? Same testing volume, strategy, PCR cycles? Are they counting probable tests? What is the health context, in terms of mortality displacement, for the country as a whole? What previous exposure to similar disease might impact severity? What is the age and health of the current population? If you can't start to both answer these and assess their actual contributions, any conclusion you reach is premature.</p>

<p>This is absolutely not true. The fact that you believe this is unfortunate. There is no correlation between mask mandates and "doing better". You can compare states in the US and see no link between mask wearing and fewer cases or slower spread. You can compare country to country and see no correlation. Masks have been mandated through out the world since mid summer, and these mandates have had no measurable impact on slowing the spread of Sars-Cov-2. You are terribly misinformed and need to look at the actual numbers and quit just accepting what you hear on CNN.</p>

        <p>I actually don’t watch the news, I choose to do my own research on what I want to know about. If you look at the numbers of, say, Switzerland, they <em>are</em> doing better than we are. Their numbers are going down and they are able to make their restrictions less tight. Our numbers continue to rise and our restrictions keep getting tighter</p>

        <p>Your main problem is that you are comparing an enormous, continent-sized, country like the US with over 300 Million people, to a tiny nation like Switzerland with only 8.5 Million people. If you compare Switzerland to a place like Virginia, a place that also has 8.5 Million people, you will see that Virginia has done much better than Switzerland. Switzerland has had 6,864 deaths, Virginia has had 4,705 deaths. Switzerland has 790 deaths per million, while Virginia has 551 per million. Switzerland has tested 3.3 million people, while Virginia has tested 4.7 million. Switzerland has had 418,266 total cases, while Virginia has had 314,481 total cases. By pretty much every metric Virginia has performed better than Switzerland. That is not to say that Virginia is the gold standard of covid responses, but just to show you that your use of Switzerland as an example is fundamentally flawed. The US has 50 separate covid responses. Some places have had extremely strict regulations like California, Washington, New York, New Jersey, etc. Some have have had fairly lax regulations like South Dakota, Florida, Georgia, Utah, etc. What you will notice when you actually go through the numbers is that there is no relationship between the strictness of measures and "better" numbers. Where I live in Utah, we have only 366 deaths per million, which is 6th best in the US. And there was not a statewide mask mandate until the end of October. Utah had one of the loosest lockdowns in the country, and has performed better than nearly every state. Most schools are in person, all restaurants are open for dine in. Theaters (movie &amp; drama), resorts, salons, etc. are all open. Most businesses only ever closed down for about a month back in April. Churches have regular in person meetings. Stores are as busy as ever. So why should I want to be more like Switzerland? Look at Florida compared to New York. Both have around 20 Million people, yet New York's numbers are twice as bad as Florida's, and Florida has consistently been loosening its regulations for months, while New York has been getting more strict. California has had one of the most strict lockdowns in the country since May, and currently its numbers are skyrocketing. Its overall numbers are in the middle of the pack, even though they have locked down harder than almost anywhere else. This same phenomenon has happened throughout the world. All of western Europe locked down extremely hard and has had mask mandates since spring, yet everything they did had no measurable impact on their overall numbers. In the end, why do you believe that tighter restrictions will lead to better numbers?</p>

        <p>&rt; I’m focusing on the mask, because I asked about the mask.</p>
<p>I agree. Just like I said, people who have been indoctrinated focus on the mask and ignore... or defend... labeling their friends and family and neighbors as "Unessential".</p>
<p>&rt; And yes, is it a surprise to you that some peoples jobs are more important than others?</p>
<p>I am not only surprised, I'm shocked every time someone argues that it is acceptable for the government to label people "Essential" and "Unessential". Every single time that has happened in the history of mankind, it has been horrible for society.</p>
<p>This example is no different.</p>
<p>&rt;Some jobs save lives, others just stock shelves in a grocery store.</p>
<p>You aren't only in support of it, you are proud of telling the grocery store worker (Not really a good example, since they did not lose their jobs) that he is "Unessential" and deserves to lose his job and go into poverty.</p>
<p>&rt;If you want to talk about saving lives, then you need to focus on the jobs that are needed to save lives and to keep people alive</p>
<p>At no time did I say those jobs should be forced to stop. LOL.</p>

        <p>What it comes down to for me is logic. Mask mandates are just unnecessary. I'm quite civil and always want to have an open discussion with people that range from strongly disagreeing with me and being an asshole about it, to people who just aren't sure on the subject. So I genuinely welcome you to try and pick apart my take on the matter.</p>
<p>I've repeated this ad nauseam on here to many trolls, to which I never get a reasonable rebuttal: If someone is so terrified and paranoid of this weak as fuck virus, they should "Stay. The fuck. Home.", right? Protect the vulnerable the best you personally can, and take whatever necessary precautions you need to in order to make yourself feel safe. You live your life, I live mine. That's what it all boils down to for me, at the end of the day.</p>
<p>In addition, masks would really only work well if people used them properly, which the vast majority of people aren't. They improperly wear their mask, improperly store it, touch it often, and/or don't wear a quality of mask that's truly effective. Doing these things is often seen as being worse then wearing no mask at all. Yet if you put a piece of cloth that you've worn for months on end while repeatedly stuffing it in your pocket, you're seen as a good guy by the masses and the media, even though the only purpose it will serve is to make others feel better. That's all not to say that they don't work whatsoever, but the mainstream viewpoint is that if everyone wore a mask we'd be totally fine. Case-in-point in all this: Look at California right now lol.</p>
<p>Mask mandates, which are always paired with socially distancing, have huge effects on the ability for our youth to get a quality education. They also massively harm businesses that are so desperate to survive in this world due to all the restrictions placed on them.</p>
<p>What do you do about enforcement, how would go about such a thing?</p>
<p>Then there's all the issues with infringement of personal freedoms and restrictions of personal movement.</p>
<p>Not to mention, they're an obvious royal pain in the ass as far as trying to communicate with someone and to simply breathe - particularly if you already have difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>Finally, I could go on all day about how lockdowns (something that's supported by tons of very pro-mask people), are absolutely terrible and ridiculous. But that's another topic.</p>

        <p>The misuse of masks is definitely a huge problem, but I feel it could be pretty easily solved by stores handing out sterile masks to everyone who comes in. Masks would only work is <em>everyone</em> used them correctly. The thought process of “you live your life and I’ll live mine” just isn’t fair because due to the fact that you aren’t wearing a mask, you’re affecting everyone around you. All of these mandates are really fucking things up for everyone around the country, but that’s mainly because not everyone is following them, so they’re being dragged on for much longer than they have to be. Other countries who have been following their mandates actually are loosening their restrictions and they are closer to a more normal job system, while we continue to tighten restrictions, making it harder and harder for our economy</p>

<p>Who pays for this? Extra expense for the business who’ve already been robbed blind by endless lockdowns and trading restrictions? Or Joe Public once again? Who delivers them? Who pays for the shipping? Who pays for the environmental impact of all those extra lorries on the road?</p>

<p>You could use the same logic for every year of human history. The idea that your health is everybody else’s responsibility is ridiculous and unsustainable. This is what I’ve found to be so toxic about the age we live in. </p>
<p>What’s more, they don’t really do anything anyway. You can look at any graph of cases/deaths in any country or state that has introduced a mask mandate and you will not be able to pick out from the numbers when it was introduced. If you don’t want to do that, here’s a clip of Anthony Fauci saying they don’t work:
https://youtu.be/X7aqbX-tQH4</p>
<p>He later U-turned on this of course, saying he wanted to protect PPE supplies for healthcare workers. Now to me this is an admission right from the early days of this crisis that he’s prepared to lie about public health for political convenience. Why shouldn’t he do it again? I believe all evidence points to him U-turning because masks are an easy way to measure compliance at a glance. Make up your own mind. </p>
<p>&rt;All of these mandates are really fucking things up for everyone around the country, but that’s mainly because not everyone is following them, so they’re being dragged on for much longer than they have to be.</p>
<p>Maybe you’re right, maybe if everybody, right from the word go had followed every restriction to the letter, we might be out of this. But they didn’t and fewer and fewer people will the more times we are ruled by coercive tactics by untrustworthy elites. They’ve tried to legislate against human nature, it hasn’t worked, more and more people realise this and compliance is not going to increase. People are getting poorer and living in hunger, which historically has led only to violent uprisings and revolutions. I don’t want it to come to that, but the chances are only increasing as time goes on. </p>
<p>We’ve got more in common than you might think honestly, we both live in fear and anxiety. You’re scared of death and illness, I’m scared of losing the freedoms of the liberal democracy I call home. Here in the UK we have just seen Christmas cancelled by our government; they waited until a parliamentary recess until making this ordnance when they have known about the “new strain” that they’re basing it on since October. It is not the first time that parliamentary protocol has been abused in this way since the crisis began and we are not seeing the government be held to account by the opposition. People mock us for our emphasis on freedoms but people have fought and died for thousands of years for them and we’re seeing now how easily they can be taken away. </p>
<p>R/lockdownskepticism is a good place to start if you want to research more, I do like it here but it can get more angry and conspiratorial. You should maintain critical thinking on everything you read after all. Just ask yourself at what point the cure might be worse than the disease.</p>

        <p>&rt;stores handing out sterile masks to everyone who comes in</p>
<p>Sure, I've seen this before. But then you also have to bank on every employee enforcing it properly, consistantly, and at all times. And that's if the masks would do much in the first place. Plus, if they're doing all that, they may as well strictly enforce a whole lot more precautions too while they're at it. I also imagine it'd be difficult for large business to do this. Funny enough, I went to a pretty busy business over the summer where they asked all guests to wear a mask, and would provide them for free before they could enter. A couple months later, they found they were going through them like crazy, so they started charging $1 per mask lol.</p>
<p>&rt;due to the fact that you aren’t wearing a mask, you’re affecting everyone around you.</p>
<p>But everyone that's around me is quite willingly and consciously making the decision to go out into public. If they notice I don't have a mask on, they can always steer clear of me easily enough. Again, protect the vulnerable and take whatever precautionary measures you personally need to in order to feel safe, and you should be fine. One person that's not wearing a mask in your mere presence is ridiculously unlikely to result in your harm, let alone your death. Or anyone else's death, for that matter. I think it's ridiculous that people go out into public, putting countless others at risk, just to get their "fire af Starbeez pumpkin spoce latte", while demanding that every other person and business adhere to their standards of safety and sanitation.</p>
<p>Risk is a part of daily life that so many people seem to not want to acknowledge. You have a way higher chance of being harmed by driving to the grocery store to get your massive jug of hand sanitizer then you do from being directly harmed from this virus. No one's afraid of driving though.</p>
<p>&rt;All of these mandates are really fucking things up for everyone around the country</p>
<p>Correct. So speaking of being harmed, wouldn't it be better to let people take their own precautions and decide how to live their own lives, as opposed to directly hurting everyone in the country with mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns? The world is safer and more sanitary than ever right now.</p>
<p>This whole pandemic is based on a "maybe". "You maybe kinda sorta have a chance to contract this virus, that has the chance to potentially maybe harm you. So because of this, we're going to to definitively do massive harm to everyone."</p>
<p>&rt;but that’s mainly because not everyone is following them, so they’re being dragged on for much longer than they have to be</p>
<p>But you said it yourself, "Masks would only work if everyone used them correctly." Which we know just isn't the case. Plus, we'd all need a specific grade of mask, paired with large-scale lockdowns - something that is an absolutely awful idea.</p>
<p>In addition, this is the United States. A massively sized, and hugely populated country with an economy to match. Pair that with us being founded on having so many freedoms, liberties, and rights that so many others are actively dying for just for the chance to possibly attain them, and it's not easy to assure 100% compliance with these things. It's been nearly a year already, things aren't going to suddenly change. So it's probably not a good idea to continue to try and push for large-scale mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns. We already know they don't work, even at the height of compliance. Not even just in the US, but around the world. Essentially every country is still screwed over by this virus, proving that more than anything, we really don't have a good way of fighting this thing.</p>
