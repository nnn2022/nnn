    <strong>Have Police Officers been stationed in grocery stores in your area ever since COVID?</strong>
    <p><p>Just wondering if this is a thing elsewhere... Ever since March, all of the Aldi’s and several Krogers in my city have had a police officer standing at the front of the store. This never used to be the case during normal times. </p>
<p>While it’s always great to have a Police Man or Woman nearby wherever I am in public, if this whole purpose is to enforce masks, then I think it’s a waste of resources — especially being that my city’s police force has been well over 1,000 officers short for a while now. Has anyone else had this happen in their local stores? What is the actual purpose?</p>
<p>edit: and to clarify, they are the actual Metro police officers — not some rent-a-cop or security guard.</p></p>

        <p>Haha, usually they are, but when I went last night the cop wasn’t. He was sitting way back by the closed registers watching videos on his phone with his mask in his hand. I don’t really care though, he probably thought being there was pointless to begin with, and I don’t blame him if so.</p>

        <p>Yes I was at a pizzeria in Brooklyn. Cop had no mask.  I tucked mine under my chin and we were talking. No one aside from one guy had it on or properly on. No one cared.  The cop legit couldn’t be bothered it was also right after the crime surge in NYC so he had lots of other priorities plus bad optics given the situation with police brutality. </p>
<p>Funny part is me and the cop with the other customers were more than 6 feet apart so aren’t we good?   It was either mask or stand 6 ft apart. Not both.</p>

        <p>In my neck of the woods in PA, I've seen some, yes. It's mostly at grocery stores and at Walmarts. Some malls I've been to have had more security guards and/or police officers patrolling the vicinity. I believe they are all checking for mask compliance.</p>

        <p>None here, which surprises me.</p>
<p>Why would you see cops out doing mask enforcement? Look at what cities and municipalities have chosen as the punishment-of-choice for those who refuse to don the Holy Face Diaper...</p>
<p><em>Fines.</em></p>
<p>It's nothing do with public health, it's simply another revenue generation stream.</p>

        <p>No cops at mine but they have always had a security guard.  When the bullshit started they set up a table near the entrance with gloves and hand sanitizer and signs on the salad bar and breakfast/lunch bars to please wear gloves while serving yourself.</p>
<p>Then after months and months the mask mania began and the security guard started carrying a box of masks as well as boxes of them on the table and if you walked in without a mask on the guard would rush up to you with a mask in their hand.</p>
<p>Now the food bars are all blocked off and you have to ring a bell to get a worker to fill your container for you because we are all being treated like children now.</p>
<p>I used to put on a podcast and wander around the grocery store and browse everything and shop and think about meals for the next few days.  Now I'm just so angry going in there I am just like MEAT, MILK, PASTA, GET OUT, FUCK I FORGOT SOMETHING!</p>
<p>And it used to be if I forgot something I'd be like, whatever, just run back out to the store.  Now it's just like...eh...fucking masks.</p>

        <p>Neither does my city. We’re over 1,000 officers short. Then again, you’d likely get in more trouble for not wearing a mask in a store, than for burning the whole store down or looting it.</p>

        <p>There is one at the Walmart here too. Honestly though, what do they do if you go in without one? Particularly since there is a clause in the mandate they there are exceptions? </p>
<p>I have a friend in another state who will just waltz right by the police at the front without a mask and just tell them no if they say anything. But some people are getting fined and stuff, so if they aren’t giving fines why is the police officer there? And if they are giving fines how is she able to just go right in? It confuses me.</p>

        <p>Back in the spring or early summer, the sheriff's office flew helicopters over my area late at night. I'm not sure why, but I was thinking it was used to enforce curfew and monitor the roads.</p>

        <p>There are security guards at many of the shops I frequent. Mostly there to enforce distancing and check the rowdy ones.</p>
<p>I've never seen one legit bug someone about how they were wearing a mask. Most are just doing a job and aren't on some crazy power trip.</p>
