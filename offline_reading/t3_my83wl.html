    <strong>A Pregnant Med Student Explains Her Decision to Get the COVID Vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>This story reeks of being scripted bs, starting with the fact that she's 33 years old...</p>
<p>notice how the author, and the person the author is supposedly interviewing, both just happen to be "woke" enough to say "pregnant people" several times at the beginning of the piece, </p>
<p>but by the end of the piece they start slipping up an calling them "pregnant women"</p>

        <p>I’ve been shamed by my friend who is Trans for bringing up the progress I’ve seen for woman in society around menstruation. Apparently my acknowledgment of progress for women and our increased ability to discuss menstruation ignores Trans women, and is therefore not PC. </p>
<p>In all honesty, it pissed me off. I’m a late thirty year old period haver, and I’ll be damned if ANYONE is going to try and quiet women anymore than we already have been since forever. What really upsets me is that this time our silencing is under the guise of “inclusion”. True inclusion doesn’t involve shaming and silencing fellow marginalized groups. Trans women are women as much as non menstruating women are women. We all deserve to speak freely on our experiences without fearing it will accidentally offend someone. Especially when that someone has zero personal understanding of our experiences.</p>

        <p>More coronaganda!</p>
<p>This is lady is really mentally ill:</p>
<p>&rt;I talked to my OB-GYN, who kind of had the same sentiments that I had,  which is that <strong><em>we don’t have a lot of data right now</em></strong>, but a lack of data  is not the same thing as a known risk. </p>
<p>That's a hint lady, do not be a part of the medical experiment; you do not know what harm the "vaccine" will do to you and your baby because of lack of data. </p>
<p>Another gem:</p>
<p>&rt;..... our son is the result of a lot of medical intervention and financial expense. </p>
<p>So you and wifey are going to put at risk all the money, time, energy and potentially the life of your unborn baby for brownie points!</p>
<p>Your can't make this:</p>
<p>&rt;......because I think if I’m going to advocate for something like  vaccination, it’s important to demonstrate that I’m not suggesting other  people make a choice that I’m not willing to make myself. </p>
<p>Are you or the wifey going to be the advocate for your baby when it is found out that you gave birth to a baby with serious birth defects or issues as a result of the "vaccine?" I am asking for a friend.</p>

        <p>i agree that this person probably does not exist, and is merely a sock-puppet that the ventriloquist author is animating...</p>
<p>but, i do believe there are ordinary lay people, who sincerely believe vaccines are safe and effective, and really would vaccinate a pregnant woman, </p>
<p>because the risk-reward matrix in their head has been built on propaganda and brainwashing, </p>
<p>to the point where they sincerely believe that NOT vaccinating a pregnant woman, is actually more risky than vaccinating a pregnant woman. </p>
<p>and i can point to the 1960's rubella epidemic, and the wave of birth defects that resulted. </p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_rubella_syndrome</p>
<p>this rubella epidemic, and the fact that it is known to have caused a huge wave of children born with CRS/AUTISM</p>
<p>is why vaccine propagandists will claim, with a straight face, that <em>vaccines prevent autism</em>...</p>

        <p>This is probably straying off topic a bit, but serious question about the autism claim with vaccines, since I had faith in vaccines until these mRNA ones have gotten pushed like crazy.</p>
<p>Supposed what you claim is true, how can you explain why China does not have as many kids with autism. They get basically all the same vaccines. Is it possible that the couple different ones would be causing it? </p>
<p>Alternatively, right now it seems more likely because they screen babies pre-birth and get them all aborted before. I’ve lived in both countries and there are very few autistic children, or even adults, in China, however, I see them everywhere in the US. Seems more likely the autism thing is people trying to find patterns where there isn’t one, whereas these new vaccines actually do fuck people, especially younger, up.</p>

        <p>Interesting that your reply appears to have been auto-removed without even displaying as a deleted comment, guess you hit a keyword.  I think this is complete bullshit because we should be able to have civil discussions on such matters without big brother always censoring us because that is what leads to more misunderstandings and invites conspiracy theories.  For that reason alone, it almost makes me want to believe in you.</p>
<p>At least I am sure we can agree Epstein didn't kill himself.</p>
<p>However, my biggest issue with your reply is that it still does not add up to me.  You claim east Asians should be more likely to have these issues, yet autism does not seem to be prevalent in China at all.  Perhaps more important is that you mention the MMR vaccine, which they do give in China and I know it is under 1 year old (which I assume counts as early enough to be bad according to your claim).  </p>
<p>You can choose to get your child vaccinated with the western vaccine if you pay more money, or you can get the cheap made in China version.  The reason for this is there have been too many (il)legitimate vaccine scandals in China that resulted in very serious permanent health problems for the children receiving them, although none of those issues would appropriately be described as autism.  In addition, suppose the MMR vaccine did cause issues from the western manufacturer, but not from the Chinese one (I say suppose this because in the US you would have the western manufacturer, but not the Chinese one).  Then this should mean you see more children in China among the wealthier people who chose to give the vaccine to their children.</p>
<p>Now here is the most important part, I promise you China would NEVER miss a good opportunity to smear western medicine to help make their own vaccines look better and if such a thing were ever to occur in China, it would be plastered all over every media source the Chinese government has access to, including their groups in the west like CGTN.  The number of upper-middle class people in China giving their children the MMR vaccine is certainly sufficient that you would be able to see this play out with many cases given the frequency with which I saw autism in the US.  As a result, based on personal experience, I really do not think it is reasonable to think the MMR vaccine could be causing autism among children.  It seems far more likely that these parents were simply in denial from the start and looking to blame it on something else.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to shill for vaccines and I still think all of the current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have numerous potential issues that are being downplayed by media and big pharma alike to the point they are very clearly violating ethical standards, but I can't see how a link between the MMR and autism could make sense if the assertion is that east Asians are MORE likely to have the issue.</p>
<p>More likely explanation for Japan, first time mothers average age was 30.1 in 2011 whereas the US it was 26.3.  China is 27.4 as of 2018, but that is really a moot point since they are extremely aggressive about testing for any sorts of birth defects early on and encouraging abortions in those situations.</p>

        <p>you can tell that every detail was thought out in advance, like there was a zoom meeting, and they all sat around thinking of all these angles of approach, strengths and weaknesses in their narrative, counter-arguments, ...</p>
<p>they plan every detail. like a movie script. </p>
<p>because this story is just too good to be true. its too rock solid. the character, and the message delivery, are flawless, in the eyes of the producers, and their usual consumers.</p>
<p>the narrative pretty much hits on every talking point in the current vaccine debate, and puts it into a story where the character had a dilemma, thought about it, and then took the positive action of getting a shot. </p>
<p>so, if you are a pregnant woman reading this story, and you start to identify with the pregnant character, because you are pregnant, and you are also thinking about this vaccine, and whether you want to get it or not...</p>
<p>so the pregnant character goes thru a lot of the motions of someone doing their due diligence. the character is in a position to have extended access to heath care providers and info from highly credible sources.  </p>
<p>the pregnant character leads the reader to believe its OK to disregard the lack of data, because reasons...</p>
<p>and so these kinds of stories are crafted in such a way, as to have the reader walk a mile in the shoes of the character... </p>
<p>to think like the character, and ultimately, to act like the character,  </p>
<p>they are walking a pregnant woman thru the mental process of thinking about getting a vaccine, creating an unjustified confidence in their own reasoning, and then actually getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>this is a well-known phenomenon in marketing. </p>
<p>a customer (people in general) prefer places they are already familiar with.</p>
<p>if you can get a customer to come into your store once, they will probably come again...</p>
<p>but if you can't get a customer in your shop in the first place, obviously they will never come in... </p>
<p>this is true for restaurants, grocery stores, new places of employment, other peoples houses...</p>
<p>so marketers know that the trick to getting customers is to have them come in ONCE, and then they will become repeat customers.</p>
<p>how do you get new customers to walk into your new store?  </p>
<p>you have a grand opening sale, where you make coming inside be exciting, give away gifts, etc</p>
<p>so this story does the same thing....</p>
<p>it mentally walks every pregnant woman who reads it, into the vaccine clinic for the first time, </p>

<p>in a lot of fake news stories, they work the number 33 into the story in various ways. they have been doing it so long, that the public is now very aware of it, to the point when we see a 33 we just automatically assume its fake news. </p>

But seriously prince philip was also a level 33 freemason hence the number 33 in the article (she could also just be 33)
He died at 99 years old on the 99th day of the year at precisely 9am awhile ago he said that he would like to be reincarnated as a deadly virus as a form of revenge against human overpopulation.
Far fetched of course but it always spikes my interest.</p>
