        <p>Disclaimer: Provax post. Antivaxxers, I don't downvote you, please don't downvote me. We can coexist. </p>
<p>I don't doubt that Russia is trying to undermine Pfizer (being chosen as a target because it's arguably the best vaccine on the market).</p>
<p>True motive is not to stick it to Bill Gates, but rather sell their own vaccine, and not really for money. Sputnik V is definitely not a bad vaccine, but from what I understand, Russians can't scale it's production to the scale of Pfizer's.</p>
<p>So Russia is choosing a different tactic. Pfizer sells to the population of rich countries and rich countries first. By doing that, they create a market void in poor countries, including the elite of poor countries. Meaning that for example, if Maduro in Venezuela wants some vaccine, it's unlikely that he's gonna get a hold of Pfizer. However, it's not that Pfizer doesn't sell to the elite at all. Pfizer sells to the elite of UAE, for example (regular population gets chinese shots over there). Sputnik V is better than chinese shots, they can arguably compete in the same league as Pfizer. So there is that elite market - elites of Argentina, Serbia, etc etc. You don't need to produce a lot of shots to serve the elites, so it's a narrow niche market where Russia tries to beat Pfizer. Russian idea is that by vaccinating the elite, they'll buy influence over these countries. It seems a bit illogical to me. Apple has sold an iPhone to former Russian president Medvedev, and how much influence did this give to Steve Jobs? Probably none. People are unlikely to get influenced by suppliers, at least not to the degree that suppliers want to imagine sometimes.</p>
<p>The juiciest part to me is how Russia justifies this to their own population. If Russia has production problems with their best vaccine, population should be furious that Argentina is getting something that could've been used to vaccinate Russians. They combat it two ways: by keeping the population mildly antivaxx (Putin never got the vaccine himself, which makes the population distrust it a bit, but not too much). They also advertise the second vaccine EpiVacCorona. That's a shitty one (it doesn't really work), but who knows that in Russia. It's easy to produce. So Russian model is 2 vaccines: one of for more important people, another for less important people. Also, they gauge &amp; slow down the demand by putting people in the queue. This tactic could've been used in other countries too. People calm down when they get a notification that they are N2675 in their local queue. It really means nothing, but calms people down.</p>

        <p>The issue here is that anyone who wants to get the vaccine, is welcome to do so on their own accord, however people that choose to not get the vaccine should not be discriminated against. </p>
<p>We are not ‘anti vaxxers’ we are pro choice.</p>
<p>Take a look at Israel and how they’re doing, discriminating against their own who are unvaccinated, not letting them go to gyms, theatres etc. </p>
<p>In my opinion where the vaccine comes from is irrelevant, no doubt Russia’s vaccine will be better than the rest but people who do not wish to be vaccinated shouldn’t be ostracised.</p>

<p>I totally and wholeheartedly agree with that.</p>
<p>I even support jehova's witnesses who die refusing blood transfusions.</p>
<p>The right to refuse medical help is super fundamental. </p>
<p>I also don't think antivaxxers are a threat to herd immunity. If you don't get the vaccine, you'll get the virus sooner or later, which is the nature's vaccine.</p>

        <p>Exactly, everyone should make their own calculated risks based on their own conclusions. </p>
<p>The US looks like it certainly won’t make vaccines mandatory but Europe is goosed. They’re currently in talks of getting ‘vaccine passports’ like Israel. </p>
<p>While they say it won’t be mandatory, they’ll certainly try to make life for the unvaccinated very difficult. Employers could demand staff take the vaccine, no entry to gigs, no entry to the gym, cinemas, pubs. </p>
<p>The Western world always looks to the US and what they do and follows suit, hopefully the US pave the way for the rest of us because it’s just such a dark time for humanity.</p>
