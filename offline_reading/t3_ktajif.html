    <strong>Coworker Praises Being Prisoner Abroad</strong>
    <p><p>Just gotta vent because my workplace is full of sheltered idiots who absolutely love virtue-signaling. A coworker traveled abroad and has been on strict quarantine, being treated like a prisoner for 2 weeks. He's only been allowed to open the hotel door for 15 seconds 3x a day (his words). But rather than complain about being kept prisoner and paying for his own cell, he took the opportunity to complain in a public work channel about the entitlement in the US right now. Someone commented how impressive this country was at handling things too.</p>
<p>I don't even have words, usually I'm better at ranting but this is just sickening.</p>
<p>Not gonna share any other details just in case.</p></p>

        <p>This is why I stopped using slack at my job.  The jackasses there have turned it into political nonsense.  I simply haven't opened the app on my laptop for months and uninstalled it from my phone.   My boss asked me at first over email why I wasn't answering and I was honest with him that people talking there about their politics pissed me off and I wasn't going to use it.  He understood and just emails me now.  Fuck slack and fuck people who think politics in the workplace is okay.</p>
