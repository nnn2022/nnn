        <p>this is pretty much the exact same situation I had to endure. my grandma was already not doing well. she was 87 and spent the last year of her life locked inside her glorified jail cell.  little to no human contact especially from her family.  she apparently tested positive for covid but had 0 symptoms. she died a month later.  they tried to stop me from seeing her, when they did finally allow me in the required me to be in a full head to toe protective equipment with goggles gloves and everything.  I got to her room peeled all that bull shit off and told the nurse im not letting my grandma see me all covered up. I held her and kissed her, told them if they have a problem with that then call the fucking cops.   its fucked that we had to wait till she was knocking on deaths door before we could see and touch her.( although we weren't supposed to touch her)   these are the people we are supposed to be protecting, and she did nothing but suffer physically and emotionally for the last year of her life.  im beyond furious over this lack of human empathy from our joke of a government. they're going to get theirs one way or another someday. fuck this scamdemic and fuck these lockdowns.
on a side note, my aunt and sister kept all thier "protective" gear on when they saw her and didn't make physical contact with her like I did. both of them got covid, and I didn't. go figure ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

        <p>This didn‚Äôt happen to me but another user shared this on a post and it made me so fucking angry I had to share it along.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm sitting here asking myself ‚Äòwhat would I have done‚Äô </p>
<p>My first thought is I‚Äôd have gotten violent.</p>
<p>Then what? Well they‚Äôd call the cops. Then what? I‚Äôd get more violent. Then what? They‚Äôd probably shoot me.</p>
<p>That pisses me off. </p>
<p>In all honesty I‚Äôd just have to take grandma back, stop treatment and let her die at home.</p>
<p>I couldn‚Äôt leave her there, hooked up to machines and utterly alone, just so the hospital can send me a bill when it‚Äôs done...fuck that.</p>
<p>But that also means she wouldn‚Äôt have access to end of life care.</p>
<p>Being put in that situation is so fucking wrong, so fucking wrong.</p>
