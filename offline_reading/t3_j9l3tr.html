    <strong>I finally saw a mob harass an unmasked person</strong>
    <p><p>Wow, I didn't think I would actually see this, but it happened today. I was going up to a small neighborhood grocery store near my place which had 'social distance' lines marked outside for people to wait to go inside. One guy was in the line without a mask on. OUTDOORS with plenty of space between him and the rest of the people. Some other guy in the line starts harassing him to put on a mask and others join in. The unmasked guy had his mask with him to put on upon entering the store. </p>
<p>I was just shocked. Who do these people think they are?? It wasn't even the security guard who was asking him to put on a mask. My boyfriend and I showed up toward the end of the confrontation. I was happy to be able to at least give the guy support and let him know he did the right thing by standing up for himself. But this mob mentality and license that people think they have to tell others what to do--despite having no authority whatsoever--is just over the top. I've heard about this stuff happening of course, but it was just shocking to actually see it in real life in my own neighborhood. It's a twisted world we live in.</p></p>

        <p>two people have citizen policed me </p>
<p>one man at a walk in clinic (which sort of in fairness if we only had to wear a mask in one place should be there but still)</p>
<p>i told him to tell on me then</p>
<p>so he did</p>
<p>and then the front desk told me so i put it on but was seething inside from the confrontation</p>
<p>one woman Yelled at me for standing too close to her in a grocery line</p>
<p>I got so mad I almost coughed in her face just to make a point but then visualized myself getting detained </p>
<p>Whenever Im in public now I wear earphones and a ballcap because I dont even want to look or listen to people anymore because theyre just going to tell me some new normal nonsense </p>
<p>ive become so withdrawn and uninterested in my future as a member of society</p>

        <p>Never engage with those type of people. Also nobody has any authority to do anything to you at the store. Nobody at the store is going call the police or anything and you'd be long gone by the time they came. Knowing police they wouldn't even answer the call anyways. Point is, do not give in to intimidation.</p>

        <p>Ya though I reject the mask on principle (I actually willingly wore a mask in Japan just because I has allergies but that is because it was a Choice)
I have thoroughly adopted sunglasses ball caps and earphones
And though I reject physical distancing and always try to stand pre lockown distances from people thus forcing them to make the move away from me
I have thoroughly adopted emotional distancing from the general public</p>

<p>That's the biggest consequence of all this.  You have been conditioned to hate your neighbors, assume everyone is infected, and withdraw from your community.  It's almost like they designed this whole response to destroy the fabric of society.</p>

        <p>i assume nobody is infected because idgaf. I have told Everyone I know I dont agree with this and Im reaching out online too so Im doing my best to find like mindeds. But yeah Im done with society as a whole these control tactics make me know I am not putting my human labour into fuelling this beast. I am focused now on finding an exit strategy/ to build a life with as much self sufficiency as possible. Why pay taxes to fund my dictators? I rather find the select few that I can trust and just work on living out my life in as much peace as possible. I will not be having kids.</p>

        <p>It pains me to say, but citizen policing is very typical behavior in socialist society. We are almost here. This is how Stalin killed 20 million Russian. Every single one of them was turned in to authorities by coworkers, friends, family members for saying or thinking the "wrong" thoughts or showing disapproval of party leadership. I was born and raised in USSR. Please vote against democrats. We are in very dangerous territory now</p>

        <p>This exact scenario has happened to me. Outdoors, and walking around, far away from others except maybe my spouse. Yet I'd get an angry mob gathered around me, typically my neighbors. I've even had cars rev their engines at me or not stop for me at the pedestrian crosswalk, seemingly because they are pissed off I am unmasked. Let me emphasize this has happened <strong>outdoors</strong>.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, a lot of people here and at LDS have snarkily given me the #ThatHappened response, which is ridiculous since this is being reported in various sources, even on MSM.</p>

        <p>This is what scares me. I refuse to wear a mask while walking around outside. Unfortunately, it is mandated in my state for indoors, and I do wear it when in stores, etc. because I'm not about hassling minimum wage workers. But when we are outside, minding our own business, nobody has a right to do this. How do you react to that behavior? It hasn't happened to me, and I like to think that I will just ignore them like the annoying insects they are and walk on, but in the moment who knows if that is how it would really go.</p>

        <p>I mostly try to ignore. Recently, it escalated more, and a lady lunged at me to pull my hair but my spouse stepped in front of her to keep her at bay (I posted about it here but deleted the comment recently...). It's been getting worse, I'd say. I've gotten large, "tough" guys going after me as well.</p>

        <p>That's insane that someone actually lunged at you. The irony of being a person who cares about social distancing and public health, yet being willing to get in someone's physical space and attack them is lost on these people. At least you weren't by yourself when it happened. What a sad world we live in.</p>

        <p>They get very emotional, mostly angry, so they lose their cool and let go of all logic. Yes, even ignoring that the whole reason they are angry is because they want people to stay away, and they feel their life is in danger. People are illogical and stupid, simple as that.</p>

        <p>It's sad that we have to think like that, but I get you. And thankfully we both have never been confronted directly, and I hope it stays that way. The leader of the mob outside the grocery store was threatening to get physical with the maskless "offender". It's funny that they just don't see the irony in that when they purport to care so much for social distancing and public health. But if someone threatens us physically, we have a right to defend ourselves.</p>

        <p>No offense but to everyone in here saying they get so much backlash, what states are you guys in?</p>
<p>It just seems implausible that it's so widespread, I don't wear masks outside and even when I'm inside sometimes I get sloppy about it, and I've never had any civilian say anything to me. In fact the only time I was accosted was by police, and that was on vacation in Florida.</p>

        <p>It all depends on where you are. I happen to be in California, near the Bay Area. Indoors, masks are mandated for the whole state. In my county, people are absolutely rabid about it, and even 90% wear a mask outdoors, though they do not "have to" as long as they are 6 feet away from other people.</p>

        <p>Could be true, maybe less laid back types. It probably boils down to luck and your particular neighborhood like you said. I've been to almost every single SoCal county and to 5 or 6 other states since the March. Parts of Florida were the most mask heavy, strangely. Not at all in the panhandle, but southern FL. No idea why</p>

        <p>I think all the people, who choose to be permanently terrified of life and feel that a mask will protect them, should be the ones going to a different store. They should be the ones spending the extra time trying to find stores that won't allow anyone in without a mask. The masks and all other unnecessary rules are disruptions to our everyday life. Anyone who chooses to live in that disruption are in the wrong. Disrupt your life all you want to but, don't expext me to disrupt mine. Especially, for a pandemic that ended awhile ago. And, save it. I don't want to hear about all the new cases we are told about every single day. Cases are cases. Nothing more. There are a shit load of cases of all kinds of shit right now. There will always be a whole bunch of cases of something, for the rest of our time on this planet. Just as there has always been.</p>
<p>I wonder how many of these people, who were harassing the crazy guy trying to get some groceries without cloth over his mouth, touched products throughout the store and put them back on the shelf that day? The same products that hundreds of other people touched before them. And, I wonder how many of those same people touched the pin pad at the checkout that day? The same pin pad that hundreds of other people touched before them. I don't want to hear everyone was wearing gloves. I see very few people wearing gloves. Oh, but they wear the mask. They wear it, with no gloves and walk around the store juggling all kinds of shit from the shelves and then put it back after they see it has gluten or meat in it. Then they head to the checkout and finger the same keypad that 400 other ungloved mask wearers fingered since the store opened that morning. How does that work? The virus can only be transmitted from face holes to face holes? Greasy, mask residue covered fingers can't transmit the worst virus in the history of the world cupcake?</p>
<p>For fucks sake. Take some quiet time to think about how ridiculous the shit is. Wear your masks whenever and wherever you want to but leave us normal folks the fuck alone please. We can coexist if y'all will just shut the fuck up.</p>

        <p>The sad thing is that he actually WAS abiding by the rules and donned his mask before entering the store. It was just crazy to see people mob him about putting on a mask while OUTDOORS and well distanced from anyone else. And it was other customers hassling him, not the security guard. Just an insane and messed up display, and purely performative.</p>

        <p>Not wearing a mask is normal not mischief. It does not put anyone at risk, people still get sick even if they have a useless price of cloth on their face. There are no stores that don't require masks and he wasn't even in the store yet. Your an asshole</p>

        <p>Not to mention that we've all existed on this planet for how many years without wearing a mask? During all kinds of virus and plague outbreaks? If everyone turned off the news they'd see that it's 100% brainwashing. You wanna wear your mask fine no one said don't. Just leave us healthy people alone and let our immune systems properly work.</p>

        <p>He put exactly zero people at risk. They were screaming at him to put on a mask while outside and well distanced from anyone else. There was no reason whatsoever for that besides the thrill of some kind of implied authority these people think they have. I hope more people can stand up to these losers and let them know that they do not have that right.</p>

        <p>The dude was OUTDOORS, very much distanced from anyone else. No one was at risk here. And he had a mask to wear before entering the store, as required. This guy was following the rules. It wasn't even the store security that was asking him to put on a mask. Just some random dude who felt like he had a right to boss others around, and then the mob that joined in. Just a sickening display.</p>
