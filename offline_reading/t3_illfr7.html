    <strong>I had a mental breakdown at work</strong>
    <p><p>(This happened a few weeks ago but it’s just something I need to get off my chest. Also mild trigger warning for self harm)</p>
<p>I work at an “essential” grocery store so I’ve been chugging along this entire time.  For the first month, we didn’t have to wear masks, our only concern was that we had to put the milk and eggs out. And then corporate forced all employees to wear a mask, and then my state issued the mask mandate.
I live with my (doomer) parents and they didn’t let me leave the house except to go to work. </p>
<p>Being constantly surrounded by the customers who cussed us out if we were “closer than 6 feet to them”, or the ones who would threaten us because we still didn’t have something in stock, and the narrative that I was a terrible, heartless human because I thought covid isn’t a big deal broke me.</p>
<p>I tried talking to HR about alternatives to the mask, like a face shield, or something else but they said they couldn’t allow that due to some corporate image bullshit. I ended up storming off, threatening to quit, or not show up, and then I grabbed my box cutter and cut across my arm. It wasn’t that deep, and not that big, thankfully, but I still have the stupid scar on my arm to remind me of how much I can’t stand the new normal.</p>
<p>Management is pretty strict about wearing the masks, even in the offices and back rooms, but they seem to not get on my back as much. I guess it helps when your covid related mental breakdown happens when you’re on the clock.</p>
<p>I know I’m not the only one who’s been negatively affected by the “new normal” and I just hope this all ends soon.</p></p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that people at work have been so crazy. Don't worry, you're the sane one, you're not "terrible and heartless". The customers should have more common sense than to yell at the guy stocking shelves about supply chain problems, that doesn't solve anything. And if they're so scared of people standing close to them, it's their own responsibility to move away, not yours for just doing your job. You are not a bad person for refusing to follow rules that don't make sense. I know self-harm and suicide are tempting options for many people right now, but please stay with us! You are valuable! This is not going to be permanent, but the reason the new abnormal is only temporary is because of sane people like you who are willing to fight back against it.</p>

        <p>Yeah I’m definitely in a better headspace right now. A lot of “yeah this sucks right now, but keep it together because it WILL end”, and recently I’ve seen a lot of people starting to “wake up” about how truly fucked up a lot of this is. 
Also the “new abnormal” is gonna be added to my daily dictionary haha.</p>

        <p>I guess it  goes without saying, but do you really need the job? What would happen if you quit? </p>
<p>I'm sure working in a grocery store is stressful enough right now without having paranoid assholes yelling at you for simply doing your job. If you're to the point of cutting yourself at work, there's got to be a better solution for you.</p>

<p>The effects and memories that OP went through are permanment and will cause PTSD over a long period of time. People like OP have been running on fumes for the past six months.</p>

        <p>The problem with that is; what if his friends believe in all this bullshit? That's where I'm at. I don't want to see my friends be fooled I can't stand to be around them now</p>

        <p>Please talk to someone before you have an urge to cut again. I used to cut &amp; self harm and I think it can become addictive. If your job has you to this point do you really need it? Can you put yourself in a mindset where you don’t give a fuck what people say to you, you’re just there to do the bare minimum and collect a paycheck? Smoking weed helps!</p>
