    <strong>Went to Disneyworld and...</strong>
    <p><p>Went to Disney during a vacation to FL the other day and got bitched at by a woman in front of me in line for not being TWO 6ft floor markers away from her.</p>
<p>As she was taking up 2 floor markers herself, because of her morbidly obese husband/friend on a scooter.</p>
<p>And voluntarily going to Disneyworld.</p>
<p>I said okay and then loudly said to my boyfriend "what a fucking b****, it's not my problem you're fat". The people in line behind us laughed and backed us up, which was comforting, but still. You obviously don't care about health, you're going to a completely unnecessary place, and taking every opportunity to virtue signal and place the burden on other people.</p>
<p>But also, don't go to Disney right now. It's more expensive than usual while still having long lines and a loudspeaker tell you every 15 mins to cover your nose and mouth.</p></p>

        <p>The only places outside that I go to enjoy the time there, are national parks. No people = no bullshit.</p>
<p>Malls, downtown, my workplace office are no-go zones because of all the sanitary measures BS that makes these places completely unenjoyable and useless.</p>
<p>Grocery stores are an unfortunate necessity, but I limit my trips to once a week.</p>
<p>I can't comprehend why would anyone go to disneyworld. You go there to go to a fairytale, and no one wants a fairytale with masks and social distancing.</p>

        <p>Went to a national park yesterday. Had to fill in paperwork about covid, but what really pissed me off was the fact that the guy at exit wanted to take my temperature again. I told him how is this even possible? I’ve been sitting in the car with the aircon on for +6 hours and now you want to take my temperature?? 🙄</p>

        <p>If they didn't check your temperature, you could've forgotten we are in a pandemic.</p>
<p>Justl like every room in North Korea has to have a picture of Kim Jong-un, so that you can't accidentally forget what country do you live in and who is your leader.</p>
<p>With my family I sometimes organize no-covid days, when we don't talk about COVID, don't check the news and try to do the most normal things possible (without going anywhere that requires masks). It helps to take a vacation from this from time to time. Where I am national parks are least affected, so that's what we usually do.</p>

        <p>Honestly I could deal with the rules because to be fair, Disney makes it very clear ahead of time what measures are enforced. It's a private business and they can enforce whatever they feel like. But it's the other patrons that make it unpleasant.</p>
<p>National parks are awesome I've just been to them a lot this year so I wanted a change.</p>

        <p>They tried to ruin national parks too, but their imagination can't come up with anything beyond putting yellow tape around bathrooms, or rangers at entrance wearing masks. </p>
<p>Apple picking is very popular here in the fall and they ruined it: now there is no tractor that takes you up and down the hill, so I had to haul all the apples in my hands, in bags with thin handles that cut your hands. If you don't feel constant pain, you might dare to forget we are in a pandemic.</p>

<p>The "COVID hikers" ruined national parks on the West Coast.  All the national parks here are thronged with people who wouldn't normally be hiking or camping, clogging up campsite reservations and shuttle bus tickets and the like.  If you manage to get a campsite, prepare to not sleep much because these assholes bring their families (and family friends) of like 20 people and cram them into one campsite and run loud generators and talk loudly all night.  They throw their trash everywhere, too, and in some places are setting up camp in places where you're not permitted to camp.  In Zion NP, they even have an overgrowth of cyanobacteria in the Virgin River and La Verkin Creek thanks to insane numbers of tourists peeing in or too close to the water.  Thank God I'm a backpacker, because you can get away from the crowds that way if you go far enough, but even then the crowds can still manage to make things inconvenient as you can't camp near your trailheads before or after your trek.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the tip. My son and I had a big trip to Toronto planned this past May. Had to cancel. He was so excited. Our next big trip was planned for 2022. Disneyland or Disneyworld or both. Now I'm considering taking that $ to buy a bigger place with land and installing a pool, his favorite activity. Get him a dog and possibly ponies. If I can't escape via yearly vacations, maybe I can escape on my own property. Fucking clown world.</p>

        <p>Ha thanks. I’ll survive (obviously). But calling me selfish because i think families should be together on Christmas just really pissed me off. Especially when I KNOW they haven’t been staying home. It’s completely hypocritical.</p>

        <p>I live next to a Walmart, my mom lives at a cul-de-sac across from the same Walmart but still a good distance away. The announcement from Walmart for the first few months was so loud that I could hear it from inside my apartment, and so could my mom and sister from her house! It was ridiculous. Thankfully they turned it down so it’s not nearly that loud, but it’s still annoying. We don’t need to hear the same announcement for months on end...</p>

        <p>Dear &lt;grocery store&rt;,</p>
<p>As a regular customer over many years I've enjoyed the &lt;grocery store&rt; way of doing things. I much prefer &lt;grocery store&rt; over Safeway. Your new store at the &lt;location&rt;  is a nice place to go.</p>
<p>Increasingly I've become more annoyed though. Every time I go, I  regularly hear the announcements about masks &amp; distancing. After 9 months, I think everyone has gotten the message.  A few store signs will suffice, we don't need to be shouted at multiple times during a visit.</p>
<p>I'm thankful you removed the one-way signs, but can we kindly remove the audio announcements as well?</p>
<p>Regards.</p>
<p>Joe Blow</p>

        <p>Yes...you'd think they would just give it a rest. Be happy with a few signs.</p>
<p>If this grocery store wasn't 2-3 blocks away, I walk there often.... </p>
<p>I would go elsewhere.</p>
<p>No doubt it is a Kroger corporation decision prob....I should write a letter to the corp office.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm doing that on their online form right now!</p>

        <p>Does anyone else find it strange that there's posts, daily, about how much they blame or fight with people who fall into one or more of these categories: obese, elderly, work from home, gay, liberal (of which they describe as having a soy latte in their hand or something, to further drive home the stereotype), etc? Usually these posts are about the OP being oppressed or otherwise attacked by someone who ticks the above boxes, of which many here blame the current restrictions on (interestingly, these people rarely blame the government, just these other "enemies"). Many of these accounts are new or just began posting here or at other related subs a few days or weeks ago.</p>
<p>Just food for thought.</p>

        <p>I don't comment here regularly but I do browse regularly.</p>
<p>And to a large extent it is the fault of the people who buy into government propaganda. It's like 50/50 blame on the government and the people who make it easy for the government. Granted, you can't change human nature, and maybe it's human nature to fall for "for the public good" propaganda messaging. But the government wouldn't be as strong without people on the ground backing them up.</p>

        <p>No, I'm not denying that the people who fall for the propaganda are also at fault.</p>
<p>However, do you honestly believe only the obese, elderly, and others I described up top are doing this? Seems intriguing that the claim is that these are the only types who are engaging in this harassment. Hell, even in actual video footage of people harassing us, there's typically lots of different people of different backgrounds who do this. One recent video was of a skinny, middle aged guy trying to harass a woman, for instance. </p>
<p>These sort of posts seem to imply that only the stereotypes that people in our...demographic hate are the only ones obeying the restrictions which isn't true.</p>
