    <strong>anyone else feel they they are going crazy especially when others are acting like all this is normal?</strong>
    <p><p>its like i think im either over reacting or people dont seem to understand the impending collapse that is coming?</p>
<p>even if the great reset gets accepted by the sheep there will be a period of economicsl adjustment between the two that will lead to hard times.food shortages etc your money aint worth anything.</p>
<p>im extremeley worried of human nature during these hard times. especially how we see the herd acted when there was a fucking toilet paper shortage..</p>
<p>its just that i feel like im getting prepared for all of this while others are acting like wtv everything will be fine.</p></p>

        <p>Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times.</p>
<p>Position yourself to take maximum advantage of the hard times.</p>
<p>Nostalgia lives with rose tinted glasses.  The history of my country (usa) starts with a fight against the largest empire in the.world, struggles to establish itself, fights a civil war, embraces the industrial revolution and became a super power, has a socialist uprising in 1908, Spanish flu, fights in world war I, Spanish flu and mask lunacy 1918, fights in world war ii, jim crow, Vietnam war, market crash in the 80's, dotcom market crash 90's, housing market crash 2008, now this.</p>
<p>People thinking the world will end on either side if the spectrum can exacerbate the issue.  It will be hard times, and victors will emerge sooner or later.</p>
