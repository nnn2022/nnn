    <strong>The real source of division is "knowledge."</strong>
    <p><p>This mandatory vaccine issue has nothing to do with people's beliefs about the efficacy of the scientific method, what we are dealing with is the limits of empiricism as an epistemology (ground for knowledge). </p>
<p>People who get the vaccine do so because they "trust the science." People who don't aren't skeptical of science, they're skeptical of institutions <em>doing</em> the science. When you touch a hot stove, the knowledge that it burns is direct experiential knowledge, but when you get the vaccine because "studies show," or "my doctor said," you don't have "knowledge," your experience is outsourced to institutions, that's not really knowledge, it's faith in those institutions. </p>
<p>There's nothing conspiratorial about this, it could simply be institutional incompetence, although I think it's obvious that the "science" has become politicized. You can simply say "I don't know" regarding your stance on the vaccine, and not get a vaccine. When people are cynical or just unable to make a decision because knowledge is unattainable, the only solution the government has is tyranny, which we should be against. Then, because of  the knowledge issue, people will have to decide whether they put safety higher than liberty, and obviously many people are fine with a paternalist state because they are afraid of pain.</p>
<p>I get tired of hearing "because science" all the time, and frustrated that nobody deals with the fundamental epistemic issue.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly. Debates about mandating vaccines, restrictions on freedom of movement, etc are issues regarding democracy, society, and rights, not the scientific process by which vaccines are created and evaluated. Even if there were no safety issues or concerns with waning efficacy these questions would still be on the table. Because they're about what it means to be a human in society.</p>

        <p>Yes, "is the vaccine safe?" is a scientific question, "should we use violence to make everyone get it?" is not scientific.</p>

        <p>No problem, I wish we'd hear more discussion about the metaphysical, metaethical, and epistemic issues, the political issues are surface level. Philosophy isn't exactly popular until it's too late.</p>

        <p>i’m sure there is a lot of potential to mrna vaccines, i just want to trust that it hasnt been rushed through and pushed by a compromised and captured government, by for profit mega corp pharma co’s who have finagled a zero liability situation on these drugs we have been pushed so hard to blindly trust.</p>

        <p>They don’t deal with it because they don’t <em>want</em> to deal with it.  They’re choosing ignorance born out of fear or pride. </p>
<p>There is a very good why people haven’t woken up yet.  Consciously or subconsciously, they’re choosing it.  If they wanted to know more, they would ask, they would empathize, they would try to understand the opposition to vaccines. But they don’t do that.</p>

        <p>Yes, breaking down fundamental categories such as their epistemic beliefs is akin to losing grip of reality. It's scary. It's the typical reason why people hate talking about metaphysics.</p>
