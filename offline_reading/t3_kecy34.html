    <strong>My theory on why the younger crowd (&lt;40) is going along with all of this</strong>
    <p><p>It's because these people haven't lived through anything, they were generated in the most peaceful and prosper of human eras with almost zero problems whatsoever and thus...</p>
<p><strong>They were eager to help</strong>. They were eager to be tested and show that they can be counted upon. This is their time to shine. They heard stories of wars from their parents and grandparents and <strong>now its their time to sacrifice, they believe</strong>.</p>
<p>And they we're told that the way to help is by staying at home, by closing their businesses, etc...</p>
<p>But they were wrong and the next generation will suffer from this. On the other hand, the people born today that will live in the next 25 years will be stronger.</p></p>

        <p>I can't say I agree with this at all as a 27 year old.</p>
<p>I think that young people have recently come from school(aka. indoctrination centers) and are still trying to fit in. 35+ you generally have your life in order and can risk having socially unacceptable opinions. (steady job, family started etc..)<br>
You sometimes notice differences in opinions as soon as people get into a relationship for example.<br>
This is also the reason college students often are the most indoctrinated and unflexible-minded people out there.</p>

        <p>I dunno.  Historically, youth has been the time to rebel, older age the time to conform.</p>
<p>"Tune in turn on drop out".  "Don't trust anyone over 30" These weren't people waiting out the risk to be socially unacceptable.</p>

        <p>Youth are still anti-establishment, IMO.  But they are "anti" the wrong establishment.  They have been coded into thinking that everything is divided by Republican or Democrat.  Republicans bad, democrats good.  This is where their wisdom hasn't kicked in yet.  Allow me to retort...
Any wealthy person that is attempting to gain high office through election, regardless of political affiliation, is after one thing: Power.  They have money.  They have success in their vocation or trade, whatever that may be.  What they want is POWER.  Which is another word for CONTROL.  </p>
<p>Young people who read this: is CONTROL something you want to give to someone else?  Is that not something you would wish for your own self in your future?  Let me caution you.  What you give up right now, won't be given back in your older years.  In fact, you will lose even more.  If freedom matters to you more than a UBI, or having student loan debts forgiven, then be my guest.  Money is easily made and easily lost.  But freedom doesn't come as easily.  It shouldn't be given away as easily.</p>

        <p>Well said. </p>
<p>Probably my worst personal attribute is that I hang out with politicians.   I'm not proud of it, but if you don't play the game you can't win. </p>
<p>I have actually known politicians that worked very hard for their constituents or as we would say "the people" . But as they interpreted their wants and needs.  And that's the best of them. </p>
<p>The worst of them and I would say this constitutes the majority, are kids that got pushed around in grade school and now need to exhibit power over every situation.  I mean if you run for office your are not doing it for the salary.  You are not doing it for the working hours. That leaves fame and power.  (and possibly more financial benefits, let's face it)</p>

        <p>Completely correct. They are anti establishment however the establishment has convinced them being anti one establishment inherently means they think they are fighting “the establishment whom exist on the other side”. When In fact the establishment is not two sided, they are one in the same and that is the simple trick. In order for A very transparent plan like this to succeed takes one thing. Time. Years and years of complete manipulation. Or in other words ideological subversion https://youtu.be/Y9TviIuXPSE</p>

        <p>How about, instead of trying to find ways to blame boomers, we just accept that many people in our age range are just stupid assholes?</p>
<p>No. I'm not excusing the boomers who do support lockdowns or who were shitty parents or whatever, however people here seem very eager to lay all the blame on the elderly, and act like the youth are all innocent victims with no agency here.</p>

        <p>Well said.  Stupid assholes come from every age, every race, every gender.  They usually aren't too much of a problem, as they are normally not the majority.  But they are the loudest.  And the internet and social media gives them an outlet they never had, until about 10 years ago.  Now, it's a vicious cycle.  It breeds more stupid assholes.  At this point, they're falling out of trees like goddam crabapples.</p>

        <p>This may be true for some people, but I believe the education system is the root of the problem in younger generations (I’m 23 btw).  Participation trophies and the dumbing down of course material doesn’t help anyone learn personal responsibility or critical thinking skills.  It may sound a little ridiculous since it’s just a simple thing, but it’s a socialist thought process for little kids to be required to bring supplies (think pencils, glue sticks, whatever) to share with the whole class.  Why can’t I be responsible for my own pencils?  Why do I need to buy things to be forced to share with someone else who might not have one?  My point is: individual responsibility and liberty &rt; “the greater good.”</p>
<p>Growing up in a system like that along with all the brainwashing and propaganda of recent times, its not surprising so many young people are just going along with it.  I’m just glad I learned to think for myself.</p>

        <p>I see plenty of 40+ also conforming.</p>
<p>But yes, largely, the target group is the younger generations. They’ve made it easy since they’ve been indoctrinating kids for years in college campuses.</p>

        <p>It starts from way earlier than that - right from Kindergarten.</p>
<p>Many years ago, the emphasis was on individual thought and learning. You did your own stuff, thought your own problems through, and found your own solutions/views - which you expressed in the papers/essays/art etc you handed in. You were encouraged to THINK.</p>
<p>In modern classrooms, everything is "the group". Rather than everyone applying individual effort, the loud and the "popular" take over the group - drowning out the outliers and critical thinkers and allowing the lazy to ride along for free. "Consensus" is valued over quality, truth, or the correct answer.</p>
<p>You can see in the real world how this works out. Anything, be it politics, design, architecture, etc that is "designed by committee" is inevitably dogshit. Expensive, useless, soul-less dogshit.</p>

        <p>It speaks to honestly how moral people have become. Not a bad thing but it makes reality different. If you would have told my 2019 self how I thought today I wouldn't believe it. Harsh truths are harsh. People hate them, don't want to hear them. Thats why we are where we are.</p>

        <p>The older generation didn't go to school and that was actually better! It's economy at its best, the true nature of the tradeoff, we can't have everything. That's why I always say we need more apprenticeships and less university degrees. In order not to give space for brainwashing. Kids should be taught how to do something and that's it. The rest they can learn by themselves.</p>

        <p>This is true. Most of the Founding Fathers were either schooled at home, or self-taught. And look at what they created!</p>
<p>A while back, I read online a fascinating collection of letters home from a Private in a British infantry regiment during the Napoleonic Wars. This guy was in his early 20's, came from a farm, and had never been to school.</p>
<p>His grammar, style, and ability to present his thoughts to us was head and shoulders above most modern university students.</p>

        <p>yep, it's brainwashing. They don't know anything and have no life experience but have absolute faith in the authorities. They don't believe in freedom or even democracy, they have a low information version of the news filtered through social media and that's good enough. I don't feel much sympathy</p>
