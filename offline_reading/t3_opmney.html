        <p>I should add that I don't think this means that either of those statistics correctly capture the number of people killed, whether by the vaccine or COVID. But at least it is a fairly consistent metric and non-overlapping periods.</p>

        <p>Even if the deaths are solely attributable to the vaccines, there were 86,000 confirmed cases in Scotland by November (first 6 months of Pandemic) and 3,950,000 people vaccinated in Scotland (last 6 months).</p>
<p>If a similar number of deaths are true between the two over that time period....... well.....</p>
<p>Stats are fun.</p>

        <p>It's a fair point, but "confirmed cases" are not "cases". "Cases" are not well-defined. </p>
<p>You are obviously far more likely to be tested if you have symptoms, and the vast majority of cases are asymptomatic. Even if you use cumulative tests those tests would have to be within the time-frame that the tests can pick something meaningful up. People who die 28 days after a positive test are also extremely unlikely to have died from COVID, but (given the level of testing) people who do end up dying from COVID are extremely likely to have had a positive PCR test in the 28 days prior to death. We also don't know how many people need to be exposed to the virus to in order to produce one positive PCR test either.</p>
<p>Attribution is almost impossible either way, we have no way to even define what exactly constitutes a COVID death or a vaccine death. It's not even possible to define those things rigorously even in principle, given the non-specificity of symptoms. So I am not making the inference you want to have me making.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that "a similar number of people have died within 28 days of receiving the jab in the last 6 months as had died within 28 days of receiving a positive PCR test in the first 6 months of the pandemic."</p>
