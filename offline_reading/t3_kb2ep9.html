    <p><p>So let me get this straight. Dewine has now basically cancelled New Year's Eve for all bars and restaurants in OH with his new curfew extension BUT you can go to Bengals and Browns games and stay as late as you need to. </p>
<p>WTF sense does this make?!? Why are bar and restaurant owners not stepping up and protesting this arbitrary nonsense?!?!</p>
<p>People want to complain about the Great Transfer of Wealth but they won't do anything to stop it. Mom and pop bars and restaurants don't matter but the billion dollar NFL does? No! No they do not! Come on people! This is no longer about the virus, this is about control and power now!</p></p>

        <p>This.  The public is slowly latching on to the idea that the entire response to the pandemic was government overreach and politically motivated.  Plus, our attention spans are shorter than ever, and we all should be given credit for even entertaining the idea of compliance to arbitrary rules for nearing 1 year.  By spring 2021, non-compliance is going to be the norm.  Vaccines will be given, many will take them, and the wheels on this massive shit bus will blow off of vaccine side effects turn out to be WORSE than the illness.</p>

        <p>That's my prediction. I fear the vaccine far more than the virus. </p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see the "officials" scrambling to cover up any negative public health effects of it. Anything less than <em>I am Legend</em> zombie vampires roaming the streets will be explained away by the press as the result of "bigotry/racism/capitalism" or something else that fits their narrative.</p>

        <p>I do not expect that the vaccine will be worse than the illness.  I do, however, expect continued media manipulation, as you said, to fit a narrative.  This is the modern world, after all.  It is going to take an uprising by Americans and people all over the world, to say “no” to the tricks, lies, and half truths we see on places like Reddit, and all the usual MSM outlets.  This doesn’t have to be some uprising in violent form.  Simply turn off the tv, close that browser on our computers, or delete that app on our phones.  We all need to disengage from this endless cycle of crap.</p>

        <p>Are you going to be the one to step up and organize this? You ready to go toe to toe with tyrants and dictators? Its easy to say this in front of a screen. It's much tougher to disobey when you have a family to provide for. The first ones to rise up will usually get punished the most severely. Are you willing to take that risk? If not, stop preaching. </p>
<p>A true patriot might be willing to accept the risk. Unfortunately, I don't know if we have what is required to end this. Better to hope it goes away and we can go back to our "normal" lives than try to fight it and end up dead or imprisoned. I'm not saying that's the right perspective, far from it. But the way I see it, we are more content with our "miserable" lockdowns than we are with standing up and fighting. If I fight for you and your freedom, how do I know your gonna fight for me and my freedom? Back in the day, we assumed all Americans valued freedom and we were willing to risk. Now, at least 50 percent of the country does not value freedom. I'm not sure someone would fight for my freedom. Therefore, I might not be willing to risk as much as I once would. Soldiers fight because they know their comrades will do anything to protect and defend them. I don't think the general public feels that way.</p>

        <p>I'm in northern Kentucky, and unless the weather is horrible (which it might be), I might go down to downtown Cincinnati on New Year's Eve and just throw a big New Year's celebration right in the streets - curfew be damned. I've already been to Cincinnati after curfew, and nobody seems to care.</p>
