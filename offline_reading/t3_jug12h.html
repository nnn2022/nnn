    <strong>Help me out...</strong>
    <p><p>It's probabbly going to look like I'm a troll, but I really want to understand where you are coming from. You seem to hate masks and temporary lockdowns and worry that it is going to result in a permanent loss of freedoms.</p>
<p>Is it a matter of feeling that masks don't work?</p>
<p>is it more that you don't see covid as a threat to anyone or just to you personally?</p>
<p>Or if you believe in the threat that a mask isn't worth it? </p>
<p>No judgment, not looking for a debate, just want to hear the other side. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p></p>

        <p>It's been 7 months and nothing has changed. Masks did nothing to stop a first or second wave. We've reached a point where we treat everyone like they're radioactive and assume everyone has covid. Just saying something about science and lives etc gives you full opportunity to endorse enforced lock down. It's a serious illness if you have a severe case but it has also became a psychological disorder.</p>

        <p>I can’t go to school because of this. It’s not about wanting to go to a bar or club, I am 14. It is about my own education. It is about me being told that my life isn’t worth living because someone is at risk. Life is full of risks, and it is your decision wether or not to take them. I am ready to move on, but if someone else isn’t they can just stay at home forever. However, they cannot expect <em>me</em> to stay at home forever.</p>

        <p>Also there is nothing wrong with wanting to go to a bar or club. It is human interaction. For some people that is part of what brings happiness to them. I could see if it was a couple months or a few months but it has almost been a year. Like Ron Desantis says that’s what college kids and young adults do.</p>

        <p>The main problem with masks have been discussed ad infinitum elsewhere on this sub and others. Their usefulness in the public sphere has never been proven scientifically and they may be doing absolutely nothing to slow the spread. It would be extremely easy to prove their usefulness with a randomized controlled trial, yet not one has been published. This did perform a large randomized controlled trial in Denmark yet scientific journals have refused to publish the study. Why is this the case?</p>
<p>The main problem most of us have is not with people who choose to wear masks, it’s with the mask mandates. There’s a big difference between these two scenarios. One where the government dictates with whom you can communicate and one where people are free to evaluate the risk and do what’s right for themselves and their family. </p>
<p>I wear masks in public, but I have absolutely no faith that they are doing very much, if at all. </p>
<p>Also what is the endpoint here? Fauci has said that covid will still be with us even after a vaccine. There is absolutely no guarantee that a vaccine will be shown to be safe enough to give to young healthy people. There are legitimate reasons to believe that mask mandates are harmful to society.</p>

        <p>Yea, I have a p100 mask.  The standard cloth ones everyone is wearing and loose fitting or improperly worn ones I'm not convinced are doing too much since we know it's airborne now. If everyone that was at risk wore a p100 mask then maybe we wouldn't need widespread mandates.</p>

        <p>I'm very much in favor of masks but am totally against businesses being shut down or people being kept from them.  "Temporary lockdowns" yield permanent damage.  Already some people likely will never work again.  I'd like to know from you why you are in favor of economic destruction.</p>

        <p>Why are you in favor of masks for the general population?  </p>
<p>Of course someone should wear a mask if they want, but I’m curious as to how you arrived at that conclusion.  </p>
<p>I have found that the big difference between those who are for a mask compared to those against is the data available and interpretation of that data.</p>

        <p>Forget about masks!  You're focusing on the wrong thing!  A government advising or telling people to wear a piece of fabric is light years away from them closing down businesses they don't own and ripping up the fabric of society in the process.  That is all people should be focused on, that governments cannot be permitted to do that.</p>

        <p>No, they are totally intertwined.  Its all about control.   Forcing people to attach something to their face is just as much a violation as shutting down business.   Its the same thing, except on a personal, psychological level.    Both lockdowns and mask mandates combine to "rip up the fabric of society".</p>

<p>Mask mandates are ONLY enforced by businesses because the government threatens to fine them if they don't comply.    Come on bro, businesses didn't just decide in a vacuum to suddenly require everyone to wear masks this year, lol.</p>
<p>It's because government is forcing them to.  Stop trying to find creative ways to make it seem that lockdowns and mask mandates aren't related</p>

        <p>Well, alot of it comes down to the type of mask imo. 
If the virus attaches to mucous membranes then An etsy cloth mask I think is doing very little if social distancing is followed.  A p100 however would certainly make a massive difference</p>

<p>If my math is right: 03% of 328 million That's over 10,000,000 people dead.</p>
<p>Even then we don't know the Percentage of people who survive but with reduced quality of life, lung damage heart damage and who knows what else. </p>
<p>Personally that is what concerns me more, the long term effects.</p>

        <p>Can you please check your math on that? Also it's not like we would expose vulnerable people to the virus directly, we just want the people who are at zero risk to be able to live their lives</p>

        <p>Did the math again. Looks like it would still be around 10 million dead.</p>
<p>It does suck to have our lives constrained.  How would we keep these vulnerable people from getting exposed?  </p>
<p>In my case my mother has high blood preassure, diabetes and athsma.  What do we do to protect her while we all living our lives if she could risk infection by simply going to the grocery store ?</p>
<p>It's a tough situation and I just don't what's the right thing to do</p>

        <p>Bud... 0.3% of 300 million is 1 million. And vulnerable people should have the OPTION to work from home. There's an hour when only at-risk people can go to the grocery store already</p>

        <p>Oh snap,  you're right, I was doing 3%</p>
<p>1 million  dead  isn't so bad.  </p>
<p>But in order to have an option to work from home employers would be forced to give them the option right?</p>
<p>How does a waitress work from home?</p>
<p>Or a retail clerk?</p>
