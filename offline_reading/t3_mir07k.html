        <p>I‚Äôm in a similar boat to you. At the beginning, the lockdowns kinda made sense since no one had a clue what was going on. But more research came out, which showed we were doing a lot of posturing (such as contact isn‚Äôt a major spreader). Yet people still cling to some nonsense notions that aren‚Äôt supported by science or anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>For example, golf courses in my area still have plugs in the cup for no good reason, but people can sit at the bars without a mask. COVID doesn‚Äôt spread primarily through touch, rather being an airborne virus.</p>
<p>My dad said it to me best, ‚ÄúAll this virus showed was to never trust the government to fix anything‚Äù.</p>

        <p>Nah you're right and it's good that you're finally noticing these things.  This virus was completely overblown and was used for nefarious reasons to shut down the US economy, begin the biggest wealth transfer in US history to mega corporations and decimate the middle and lower classes, and socially divide the population more than they already were.  I doubt we will ever recover from this.</p>

        <p>It's very scary times we live in.  But this answers the question of how so many countries have historically fallen to tyranny.  Apparently, it's incredibly easy to get the public to embrace and even demand their own oppression.</p>

        <p>This is a really fantastic post.  Thank you for sharing.</p>
<p>I feel like probably many of us had that moment where the proverbial glass was shattered; when we stopped and said, "hey, wait a second.".  </p>
<p>I've had a few.  But my biggest this year was seeing Justin Trudeau taking a knee in front of our Parliament surrounded by thousands of people for the George Floyd Protests.  Three months after breathlessly warning everyone about a super deadly virus, after closing parliament because it was too dangerous, after chiding freedom protesters.  After all that, the fucking Prime Minister waltzes into a crowd of thousands of people, and takes a knee for a photo op.</p>

        <p>Good morning! It‚Äôs all about money, power, and control. Another invisible enemy that can never be defeated - war on terror, war on drugs, war on poverty, climate change, war on racism, now the war on viruses. Our modern robber barons use these manufactured crises in order to gain the consent of the unquestioning masses, which allows them to impose more and more of this inverted totalitarianism on us.</p>

        <p>When you use logic and common sense, which you are doing in what you wrote and are using based on reality, you see how none of this makes sense and something is really off here.</p>
<p>If they're lying about this, just think about everything else they're lying about. It's eye opening and there's no putting the genie back into the bottle when you start researching what all the media and government has been lying about for years.</p>

<p>Can you please tell me where you found this?  All covid talk aside, I've been seeing this quote my whole life and I've never once seen anyone source it.  Even Wikipedia is no help here, even going so far as to say it's doubtful Goebbels even said it.   I know about the 'big lie' passage in <em>Mein Kampf</em> ("unqualified capacity for falsehood" hmmm, sounds like Fauci) but I've never seen your passage attributed. Help a WW2 nut out.</p>

        <p>Indeed.  I'm particularly interested in the propaganda aspects of WW2, both during and post-war.</p>
<p>However, your citation on that page doesn't lead anywhere.</p>
<p>I'm starting to think Goebbels never said that.  Why would a propaganda minister say something like that?  He's giving the game away.</p>

        <p>That's where I found it. It has been attributed to Goebbels for the last 60 years. </p>
<p>HOWEVER, in Mein Kampf, Hitler eludes to this concept, I forgot what chapter it is in, but he paraphrases it but not in such detail as the quote from attributed Goebbels. Other historians to believe it may have been from Hitler and not Goebbels. </p>
<p>It is possible that it did come from Goebbels since The Goebbels Diaries[1] were discovered, keep in mind as the Soviets were approaching Berlin, the remnants of the NAZI regime were busy burning their materials and papers. So, it is possible he did write it, but that evidence was burned as Berlin was being encircled by the Soviets. It is speculation on my part, so take it with a grain of salt. </p>
<p>You do raise a good question, why spill the beans, and let your opposition know what you are doing, or how you're doing it. I speculate this was said in private, and as the NAZI Party took over Germany, this became an open secret as to how they were taking power. People (e.g., Einstein, Dietrich, Freud) who saw through this, I speculate knew what was happening to Germany skipped town and went to America or a safe haven away from the NAZIS.</p>

        <p>Really?! I never understood the European Holocaust deniers despite video, photos, camp survivors and eye witness testimony about it.</p>
<p>I think it was either the Geraldo show or Oprah show where they had deniers on stage, and he let them say their opinions and then he had several women who survived the camps come up to them, they exposed their arms to show the tattoos, and the survivors were like "deny this!" </p>
<p>The deniers were speechless and looked like fools. I wish I could find that clip.</p>

        <p>Well, one of the cornerstones of their arguments is the amount of deliberate <em>mis</em>information that was spread post-WW2 regarding the Germans' actions in the camps.  The lampshades, the soap, the rollercoaster of death, the pedal-powered brain bashing machine, electrified floors, etc.  Even the well-trod story of the gas coming out of the showerheads.  Turns out, none of that happened; even Yad Vashem has recanted many of their original claims about atrocities that they once claimed were undeniable facts.  So much of the eye witness testimony people put such stock in was fabricated out of whole cloth.  And, as one of these guys (he was a certified crackpot, but his point is valid) used to say, "If they lied about that, what else would they lie about?" </p>
<p>How do such stories become reality?  Propaganda.  This got me interested in propaganda's role in the whole war.</p>

        <p>Welcome and I'm glad that you also see it the way we do because logically given the survival rate and that nearly 80% of Corona deaths are those that are obese, older and have multiple comorbidities, for everyone else apart from those demographics, it is mild and like the common cold (since that's what coronaviruses) are. This is about an agenda as most will state on here, something called the 'Great Reset', it's worth reading and part of it is getting everyone on digital passports with digital currency and social credit scores...

<p>Speaking of your coworker, I like to point to Trump as a similar example. He's a highly overweight old man in his seventies, who subsists off a diet of coke, McDonald's, and probably uppers, who sleeps no more than four hours a night. He survived the coof. I'm sure the rest of us are gonna be fine.</p>

        <p>I used to be a democrat in college and shortly after (early 2000s) I had this high and mighty virtuous smug look on my face all the time because I was taught to believe republicans were some evil people. Anyway I broke out of that spell around the Obama admin and left the LEFT. I've been libertarian since (aside from voting red this past election) my views are still libertarian. Live, and let live. 
I'm in healthcare and didn't fall for this since the beginning. Nothing made sense. You want people healthy why close gyms and not advocate for the use of vitamins that boost immunity? Why wear bacteria ridden masks? Why stay home and gain weight and eat shit? I knew this was bigger...it was about vaccines, control, depopulation, and global takeover.

        <p>I don‚Äôt think republicans are evil people. I‚Äôm more so of a separate church and state type, but even that has been abused by some people to include ridiculous things like allowing kids to be trans and take hormone blockers. </p>
<p>I agree on the hypocrisy of this all. I see huge gatherings for food trucks where I live, where people are taking their masks off and eating some deep fried crap, but all the gyms are closed? </p>
<p>Masks are ridden with bacteria, like you said. </p>
<p>Hiding from something of this type won‚Äôt help group immunity.</p>

        <p>Welcome. There is another sub called something like lockdown critical left if you're interested. I'd rather we all stayed together and learnt from each others points of views but it's good to know you're not alone. </p>
<p>Your main reason is the same as mine. If this had happened a few years ago when I was at home, it would have been beyond a nightmare. People who support this are very ignorant of others living situations and how people cope (staying out the house a lot).</p>

        <p>I absolutely agree that we should all share this space rather than go off into further politically homogenous subs. We all share a common interest in being against the "new normal", we should use that to bring us together and, as you said, learn more about each other and even discuss things we don't always all agree on. We can always unify under the anti-authoritarian banner at the end of the day. I'm so glad more people are waking up on all sides of the political spectrum.</p>

Welcome to my world. 
There is nothing wrong with being skeptical. Stopping to take a breath, and think about the situation around you so you can come to your own conclusion is a healthy thing to do. </p>
<p>That guy feeling that you are having is there for a reason. It is a primal instinct in every one of us that tells you " hey something isn't right here" some people know this feeling and they listen. Others block it out and ignore it. </p>
<p>Trust your gut! Ask as many questions as possible. DO NOT BE BLINDLY OBEDIENT.</p>

        <p>It's good to have you here and always good to hear another person has woken up. I was a left leaning woman until a couple years ago. Cancel culture/trans bs truly got under my skin and I was a trans supporter for the most part. I'm live and let live. I truly woke up the day Fauci flip flopped on mask wearing and it has been a total mind fuck ever since. Lockdown protests bad/BLM riots good just about sent me over the edge, yet I am surrounded by people who can't see any of the lies or hypocrisy. I know a handful of fully awake people and also lots of people who can tell something isn't right, but it doesn't necessarily bother them. Those people bother me the most.</p>

        <p>I agree with what you said. I support adults transitioning, but also believe in biological sex and that kids shouldn‚Äôt be cutting anything off just yet. </p>
<p>I don‚Äôt support BLM. I‚Äôm half black, so personally I get guilted by people for my views. It‚Äôs a corrupt organization that has basically taken a few cases out of context for their cause.</p>

        <p>I had zero opinion about adults cross dressing or transitioning. I treated them with respect because that's who I am as a person. But kids? Absolutely not. Gender pronouns? Not participating. There are like 60+ genders/sexualities now. I can not even. It was just fine as is. I don't get it. Last time I was at the clinic and also my first time at a new GP, I had to scroll through pages of sexuality information just to get seen. It really pissed me off. </p>
<p>I think any normal year I might have been outraged and supported BLM. I'm white and have witnessed a lot of racism, but I have also been lashed out on by black people who assume I'm racist just because I'm white. I was happy to leave the deep south to get away from both sides of it. It was very toxic. Maybe it was mostly just my county in NC because I can't say I've really experienced that anywhere else. I had a biracial friend who joked that he can't date any race because most of his family were against one or the other. </p>
<p>BLM in 2020 was crazy for so many reasons. I was considering buying an "I can't breathe" mask weeks before George Floyd because I can't deal with the masks. Then watching BLM protests pop up all over the world. It was so obviously planned.</p>
