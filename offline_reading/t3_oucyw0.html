    <strong>/r/coronavirus can't hold back the tide</strong>
    <p><p>You can't hold back reality.  The vaccines do not provide any kind of mucosal immunity for a fully vaccinated individual.  Therefore, a fully vaccinated individual can contract, carry and spread the virus just as we are seeing happen right now.  <strong>This has always been known</strong>.  No vaccine manufacturer promises immunity in their inserts.  The efficacy rate was always about risk reduction from serious symptoms, not risk reduction from contracting, carrying and spreading the virus.  Of course, risk reduction from serious symptoms is highly debateable, but it is what at least what the vaccines were designed to do (whether they do or not is something to argue, especially with <a href="https://twitter.com/pfizer/status/1420474141686255624">Pfizer now talking about antivirals being necessary to combat Covid</a>).</p>
<p>And so...I give you some highlights from /r/coronavirus.  The sub that is propaganda central...where you have to goose-step in perfect unison on so many talking points lest you be deemed a dissident.  </p>
<p>However, just like King Canute, you can't hold back the tide (of reality).  Of course, you try.  And you try.  And you try.  But reality keeps reasserting itself:-</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ou198f/dc_reinstates_indoor_mask_mandate_for_all/</p>
<p>&rt; yes, walk into packed bar wearing a mask just to sit down for 3 hours with it off. Makes sense.</p>
<p>&rt; I know I'm going to get downvoted for this, but this is ridiculous. Daily case rate is &lt;8 in 100,000, and all this is going to do is basically punish those who have already been vaccinated. </p>
<p>&rt; 100% reality of the situation, Covid has been Hijacked by politics</p>
<p>(and a shit-ton of removed posts)</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/oua6r5/breakthrough_covid_infections_show_the/</p>
<p>&rt; So given this information and the fact that it's now confirmed vaccinated individuals can contract and spread Covid to even other vaccinated individuals, how is this the fault of the unvaccinated? </p>
<p>The sub was actually a lot "looser" yesterday.  They've tightened up the moderation today, but it must be non-stop if you're a mod there - so many removed posts it's not funny.</p></p>
