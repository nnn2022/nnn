    <strong>Trouble paying bills because of the shutdowns?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m one of the people who’be been financially crushed from the shutdowns even with having gotten temp jobs. Where I live, in NJ, the roads are full of people going out shopping and to restaurants and it feels as if I’m one of the few in this predicament. Is anyone else out there having a hard time paying their loans/credit cards - even housing and utility bills as well?</p>
<p>I did hear near the beginning of all this that there may be some sort of “credit reset”  (And I do know this may not be such a pressing topic now but once the dust settles, I would think it could then...)</p></p>

<p>all the people you see that economically unaffected by the scam are all connected to the state and it's governments in some way.</p>

        <p>So many in the media think people are anti-lockdown because they miss going to restaurants. They are so detached from reality they don’t understand there are people actually suffering.</p>
<p>And they’re not interested in true human interest stories to understand it. There’s a narrative to push.</p>

        <p>That’s the feeling I’ve been getting to - the “haves” who are just inconvenienced by the restaurants and malls being restricted while those of us who never had financial problems that do now over this are ruined...</p>

        <p>We aren't yet having trouble paying our bills (grateful to have been able to have a good savings to fall onto).</p>
<p>We had zero income from end of May until late August - nothing coming in whatsoever.
Unemployment finally came through but it's pennies compared to our previous income (6figures).</p>
<p>Income is from a very uncommon/specific type of trade and the industry is not doing well at all - direct casualty of shutdowns) so no one is hiring, of course. No one anywhere is really (even outside this department).</p>

        <p>Geez! That’s a long time too! We’ve been hit since March up to now. And you are right about the lack of hiring. It’s the same here. Of course there’s many of the ... searching for the right word... minimum wage jobs hiring here but they sure don’t come close to covering the monthly expenses... Well, for what it’s worth, I’m with you.</p>

        <p>Don’t feel alone man.  I am in the same boat with paying my bills too.  We have been able to postpone our credit card payments (but still accruing interest) without impacting my credit score, but it’s getting out of control.  I have luckily been able to keep up with the mortgage but I agree that there needs to be some type of plan that would not require declaring bankruptcy and ruining your credit.  I’m not saying financial reset but there needs to be something in place.</p>

        <p>I used to have a restaurant job where I could work 3-4 days a week and make about $500+ a week. I know that isn't much still but it allows me the flexibility to be home w my son on school breaks. I lost my job with no timeline of getting it back. I got a new job but it's often only one day a week. </p>
<p>I'm very lucky in that my partner makes a good salary so we aren't missing bills but I HATE depending on him. We had a huge fight about the price of groceries- he doesn't realize how much this is stressing me out.</p>
<p>Just wanted to add that I definitely should get another job, but I have just been feeling so hopeless it's hard to find motivation, especially since any job I get will probably be a huge step back.</p>
