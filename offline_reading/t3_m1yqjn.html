    <strong>What if viruses were not causing any disease?</strong>
    <p><p>Let me elaborate.</p>
<p>You are all aware of HIV.</p>
<p>Use condoms, etc.</p>
<p>The narrative is: if you have HIV, you will die a painful death.</p>
<p>Now, this connection has been hammered into all of our heads.</p>
<p>Now think about Herpes lesions. There is this antiviral called Aciclovir. If you take it, it's said to decrease the amount of viruses in your blood. Reality is, if untreated, healing time is the same as with Aciclovir - google the sources.</p>
<p>Now HIV has been thoroughly researched yet there is still neither a vaccine for it nor a curing treatment.</p>
<p>If it takes you more than 40 years of intense research in HIV and you still cannot offer a solution, there are only two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Researchers are incompetent and cannot come up with a solution in spite of millions of research money. Highly unlikely.</li>
<li>HIV is not the cause of AIDS.</li>
<li>EDIT: Researcher enjoy the money they regularily get and pretend to find nothing to not end this stream of money.</li>
</ol>
<p>What if viruses are simply present at the same time the body gets a disease, without causing it?</p>
<p>Yes, there are bacteria and yes there are fungi, because they were recognized and the treatments work.</p>
<p>Look at all other antivirals. Even look at vaccines. There are enough people who still got viral "infections" in spite of being vaccinated to doubt their effectiveness.</p>
<p>If that is the truth, antiviral treatments are missing the point and are therefore not effective nor will they be effective.</p>
<p>If that is the truth, what is causing the effects of "viral infections"?</p></p>

        <p>Terrain Theory.</p>
<p>It's not as far off as you think.</p>
<p>Another good example is scurvy.  When sailors were dying by the boatload because of scurvy, they didn't really know what to think.  It took years for James Lind first to come up with an experiment, and to demonstrate said experiment.  It turned out scurvy wasn't caused by an infectious agent, but rather it was caused by Vitamin C deficiency.</p>
<p>Even after he demonstrated this, people didn't believe him.  The world had dozens of these competing theories.  The British Navy however, did end up adapting some of Lind's recommendations (a teaspoon of lemon water to all sailors every morning).  This simple recommendation is one of the reasons the British went on to dominate the sea, and why they are sometimes called "limeys".</p>
<p>I suspect when all this madness is said and done, history will look back on this era and say, "if only they had known it was just a deficiency in Vitamin D".</p>
<p>Right now they are busy mapping out the delta spike protein, and dreaming up complicated applications for their mRNA technology, when really they might just try researching what we already know and have in nature with something like Vitamin D.</p>

        <p>Humans are animals.  We used to live naked in the sun.  Now we live indoors with clothes on.  Vitamin D deficiency is the new scurvy.  </p>
<p>Some studies have shown vit D levels to be the single most determinitive factor in Covid outcomes.</p>

        <p>"All infections are due to Vitamin D deficiency" is also not convincing.</p>
<p>Based on working treatments, I assume fungi and bacteria to be causing diseases but not viruses.</p>
<p>In other words, what we call viral infection are symptoms caused by something else.</p>
<p>And research money is wasted for virus research instead of looking at other causes.</p>

        <p>Sigh. The <em>much</em> more likely explanation is that viruses are real, the vaccines are real, but treatments and preventatives fail more often than the marketers and health organizations want anyone to know about. A vaccine that works 95% of the time gets promoted as perfect and anyone who fell into the 5% gets yelled at, called an anti-vaxxer, and told to STFU. Anti-virals that reduce death from influenza by 15% and length of illness by an average of 2 days gets marketed as a miracle world-changing drug, not a treatment that sometimes helps and is worth trying if you're really sick. Marketers mislead about their products, exaggerating the benefits and hiding the flaws, all the time; pharmaceuticals are not a special case where everybody's honest.</p>
<p>As for vitamin D, no, COVID is not rebranded vitamin D deficiency - but vitamin D deficiency is a huge risk factor for serious illness. I bet a strong campaign to get people to supplement sensibly would have slashed the number of hospitalizations and deaths much more than all their destructive NPIs. Wouldn't cut it to 0; if you're a 94-year-old cancer patient with diabetes you might still be fucked. But studies show a big difference in outcomes between people who have good D levels and who don't. Anecdotally, out of 5 people I know personally who have had it, the two that took supplements with vitamin D had 2-3 days of the sniffles and lost sense of smell for less than a week. The three that didn't were sick (cold/flu sick, not hospital sick) for about a full week and took much longer to recover full smell and taste, despite that subgroup having the two youngest people, and everybody but one of the D takers being physically fit.</p>

<p>The much more likely explanation is that viruses are harmless, vaccines are useless at best, and treatments and preventatives fail more often than the marketers and health organizations want anyone to know about because the conjecture is false. You have no way to verify whether a vaccine works: have a test group of 10, then you infect 10 of them with chickenpox, whereas 5 of them were vaccinated beforehand? The ethical review committee will tell you off.</p>

<p>Please be careful about going down this tinfoil hat rabbit hole. I feel like you are asking good questions about how we ensure that the results of medications and studies on them show what we think they do. It is a critical question to ask and continue asking. I can promise you that on peer reviewed articles, study design, potential shortfalls, and what could have led to false results are scrutinized extensively, so you are certainly on the right track in this line of questioning.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, I think that the next conclusion that you are jumping to that there is a massive conspiracy amongst all these scientists, governments, etc needs to have you same level of questioning applied. I don't think you are comparing on the same scale.</p>
<p>&rt; ou have no way to verify whether a vaccine works: have a test group of 10, then you infect 10 of them with chickenpox, whereas 5 of them were vaccinated beforehand?</p>
<p>Please read the study design and discussion of any peer reviewed article. There are many different ways of testing for efficacy without purposefully infecting subjects. The design will explain exactly which variables are being tested, how they are being isolated to do the best to ensure any data are the result of this variable, and why this design was chosen. The discussion section will include potential shortfalls in the program design (whether because they were identified after the fact, or limited due to practical considerations, etc). Often, suggestions on the design of future studies to address these shortcomings are also included.</p>
<p>&rt; The ethical review committee will tell you off.</p>
<p>Often, yes. But not always. The IRB will take into account potential risks of volunteers to be purposefully infected during a double blind study. There is definitely a higher threshhold for this type of study.</p>

        <p>Most of the time, they use inactivated or weakened viruses, and your body is going to shrug at them and not mount a very strong response - the modified virus isn't doing much to react <em>to</em>. You have to trick your immune system into hitting it harder or it doesn't create a useful amount of built immunity. Normal wild viruses actually replicate in your cells and cause tissue damage if they get that far, and they get a stronger natural immune response in return.</p>

        <p>OK. Deep breaths. I don't even really know where to start with this one. I'm going to go slow and just tackle some of the low hanging fruit here:</p>
<p>1)The antiviral aciclovir indeed reduces viral load in an individual. It can be used for treatment of various herpes viruses including shingle, chickenpox, etc. It is not a cure, it is also not 100% effective at preventing future infections. What it can do is reduce the number and severity of future infections. It can also be used to treat new outbreaks, if caught early on. Your claim that this medication does not reduce healing time is not true. One such source refuting your claim can be read <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/190/8/1374/878164">here</a>.</p>
<p>2) Your HIV/AIDS comparison is confusing to me because while in many ways apt, the conclusions you make do not follow reality. It is true that there is no real "cure" to completely eliminate the HIV virus from an infected person (the Berlin Patient and similar cases are extreme exceptions, but we'll leave those aside). HOWEVER, in the past 20+ years, there has been significant advancement in the research in medications to reduce the viral load of patients to what is considered sub-clinical levels, even in some cases reducing viral load to being non-measurable by most standard testing protocols. While these people are not fully "cured" since the virus still lives inside them and in most cases could come back to clinical levels without ongoing treatment, it has been suppressed to the point where as long as they keep up with their medication, their risk of developing AIDS is reduced to essentially nill. The reduced viral load also has proven to reduce the ability to transmit the virus to others, whether it be during child birth or during breast feeding (see the drastic reduction in MTCT rates in sub-Sahara Africa since these drugs and associated testing have been made available widely with the enaction of PEPFAR in the early 2000s), through sexual intercourse (pre-exposure prophylaxis which is based off of these same viral suppression drugs are available as prescriptions in the US for HIV negative, but at-risk populations - hell, you've probably even seen commercials for the brand name Truvada or Duschovy on TV), as well as through exposure to blood (again, similar post-exposure prophylaxis is available to individuals who have been or fear they have been in contact with the blood, etc of an infected person, which has been a boon to front line trauma workers or people who don't find out their partners status until after the fact). All of these drugs have been proven to work for 20+ years now and are continuing to get even better.</p>
<p>3) its clear that your don't really know how viruses work - they're not all the same. A corona virus, a herpes virus, and a retro virus like HIV all work very differently. Retro viruses have proven again and again to be among the most difficult to address once they set in. The mechanism to address any of these types, either via vaccine or treatment post exposure are all very different. I think you need to do further research and study on the subject - and I don't mean reading facebook posts or whatever wackadoodle "news" sources or "studies" you find on twitter - before making any other conclusions.</p>
<p>I hope you read through this post, learn something, and that inspires your to go learn more. You clearly have an interest in the subject. There is a lot of material to wade through. The material is not always easy to read. It can be dense, technical, and require rather extensive background knowledge. Again, I hope that inspires you to try to learn more and not just take whatever answer that you want to hear at face value just because it wasn't easiest to understand or find. Good luck to you.</p>

        <p>All good questions!</p>
<p>1) The way that a good study is created is to test the variable (in this case the introduction of drug treatment) to a constant by doing a control, where there is a population within the study where no variable is included. Statistical analysis between the two groups can be run to see if the differences observed are due to the variable, or by chance. In the study that is linked in regards to the herpes medications, you can view Table #3 which breaks down the results. The columns you would be most interested in are the "P" columns, where the values displayed show the chances of the differences observed are by chance. Ie a p value of 0.01 means there is a 1% chance that the difference are not related to the variable being tested. Typically, studies are considered to be "statistically" significant when a p-value is less than either 0.05 or 0.01.</p>
<p>2) Again. this is something that is constantly being studied and tested. There is a plethora of this data available now. Again, I encourage you to read about PEPFAR and the data sources it has available for HIV/AIDS and mother to child transmission specifically. It is both fascinating and inspiring what can be done.</p>
<p>3) I'll point you back to my comment in item #1, where the answer would be the same.</p>

        <p>HIV quite literally integrates with the host DNA. It's not that simple. </p>
<p>That being said, we actually do have two recorded cases of curing HIV. It's just ridiculously dangerous and not scalable in the slightest to the general population. It involves the eradication of the immune system, mega doses of anti retrovirals, and then a bone marrow transplant from someone homozygous for the CCR5 ∆ 32 mutation. Which is all of 1% of people of northern European descent, with heterozygous (resistant rather than immune basically) being between 10-20%. </p>
<p>Also going to point out real quick that all the leaders of the AIDS denialism movement died of fucking AIDS.</p>

        <p>Uh. No. An AIDS death is counted when there's an AIDS defining condition involved or a total collapse of the immune system defined as a CD4 count under 200. This isn't COVID, there is an objective definition that's been in place since the mid 1980s.</p>

        <p>This is anti-science garbage.  We have successful and vital vaccines for quite a few viral diseases.  HIV and other retroviruses are VERY special and unique cases, in this case literally interfering with the tcells that the immune system uses to fight everything else.</p>
<p>This "because we don't know everything we clearly don't know anything" argument is old and tired.</p>
<p>Before you come up with stupid conspiracy theories, behaving exactly like the church of covid idiots with their "covid is magic and behaves like nothing else ever" crap, take some biology courses and try to understand what the adults are talking about here.</p>

<p>I do question all of it, but you can't reasonably question or assess your adversary's position unless you understand it.  You may find that when you actually understand the immune system and the mechanisms in place, they are backed by a tremendous amount of evidence and study by countless independent scientists over decades.  This many may certainly be incorrect, but there's no conspiracy baking for that long.  Your "maybe viruses don't make us sick!" wild hypothesis would need a great deal of study and explanation as to how/why this was the case, why we're seeing what we do understand if it isn't really what is happening, etc., and you've shown none of that, nor indication that such exists.</p>

        <p>It will not bother me at all if you choose to dismiss my biology knowledge because I didn't check the name on the thread.</p>
<p>We have what seems to be a quite solid understanding of the immune process and reaction to potentially-hostile foreign organisms, including the fact that most "cold" symptoms, from fever to sneezing, are the immune system in action.  If you, or he, have some other theory other than "it's all a great coincidence," it needs to be backed up and explain a great many things better than the current understanding.  I would be interested to read it, but of course with great skepticism.</p>
