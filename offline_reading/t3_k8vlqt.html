    <strong>Please, I'm very stupid. Can someone help me understand?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm confused. San Francisco has a growing drug problem and human shit in the streets. There's even <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/snapcrap-lets-you-take-pictures-of-poop-on-sidewalks-and-report-it-to-the-city/">an app you can download</a> which will alert you if you're walking near human feces. They also want people to sign a petition to <a href="https://www.sfaf.org/collections/beta/have-questions-about-bringing-safe-injection-sites-to-san-francisco-heres-some-key-info/">establish safe injection sites</a> in the name of RiSk ReDucTiOn for their precious homeless drug users. Tent cities for ~~homeless~~  currently unhoused are <a href="https://sf.curbed.com/2020/5/18/21262280/tent-city-sf-san-francisco-coronavirus-homeless">encouraged.</a></p>
<p>Oregon decriminalized <a href="https://apnews.com/article/oregon-first-decriminalizing-hard-drugs-01edca37c776c9ea8bfd4afdd7a7a33e">hard drugs including heroin.</a></p>
<p>These are lauded as compassionate, progressive, evidence-based policies in the name of public health. Because shitting on the streets, shooting up drugs, and living in a tent on a sidewalk should be supported because it's too much to ask these people nicely to stop or impose commensurate consequences for such behavior. That would be oppressive and mean!!</p>
<p>But you, a tax-paying, hardworking citizen who wants to grab a drink at happy hour, or a bite to eat with your friends? YOU ARE A POCKMARK ON THE FACE OF HUMANITY. YOU ARE FULL OF PESTILENCE. You <em>might</em> breathe upon someone with your rancid, droplet-laden breath, and that someone <em>might</em> be a lone, defenseless senior citizen with her mouth agape for no reason at all (and yes it's a <em>she</em>, because only grandmas ever die, not grandfathers, unless the grandma in question was formerly a grandfather but now chooses to identify as a grandma, <em>which is brave and stunning and NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, BIGOT!!</em> but I digress\~\~) And because you so selfishly walk around with your penis of a nose hanging out like the flaccid, useless organ it is, we cannot have indoor dining. Or outdoor dining, for that matter. And definitely no singing!</p>
<p>What's that? You don't <em>like</em> lockdown? It's hurting your precious economy?  You like breathing fresh air unencumbered by the crumpled mask you dug out of your pocket for the thirtieth time today? The isolation is driving you to the point of near hourly suicidal thoughts? Everything you loved and valued has been traded in for some off-brand virtual new normal tripe and you'd sell both your kidneys on the dark web just for the chance to walk into the grocery store without it feeling like some sort of hypochondriac's fever dream?</p>
<p>Well. That's just TOO BAD, KAREN! Because in this country, we <em>believe in science.</em> We believe that if all 330 million individuals in this idiotic, pathetic, hopelessly self-obsessed country could just sacrifice a little bit for ~~[two weeks~~ ] ~~[three months] [ a year and a half]~~  until the government decides on some arbitrary metric, we could get this thing under control. You know, really hunker down together. That's it. Is that too much to ask?</p>
<p>It <em>is</em>, however, VERY BIGLY MEAN AND BAD to ask that people not take a dump on the sidewalk. Or use hard drugs out in the open. Or live, unwashed and invariably full of a litany of other contagions, in encampments on the street. There's just nothing that can be done about these things, so we might as well accept them and move on.</p>

        <p>I've lived in Seattle, SF and Portland. I was a raging liberal until I lived in these places. Now I am a raging libertarian/conservative on most things. You don't understand human depravity until you have lived here. The wealth divide is massive. Rampant needle drug use. Truly disgusting areas.</p>

        <p>Well, although i agree with you partially, there will be plenty more of those people on the streets becasue of these lockdowns. Let's not draw a comparison that singles them out. Mental health issues are drastically increasing, with that comes substance abuse, following that comes complete, mental, physical and economic instability, consequently more people wandering homeless addicts with no place to shit other than the street. </p>
<p>Direct your hostility towards those in charge who are manufacturing more and more of these people everyday as a result of these tyrannical measures and show some compassion for these people becasue someone you know could wind up in that position soon enough.</p>

        <p>People are going to get drugs and use them, illegal or not.  When they're decriminalized, we stop locking up addicts and we can instead start treating them.  Look at the US private prison system.  It's full of the poorest of individuals, many of whom sold drugs to care for their families.</p>

        <p>People get into selling drugs because they don’t finish school or don’t try in school (there are outliers, but as a coach and tutor this is what I see). They don’t finish or try in school because society glorifies the use of drugs in music, TV, popular culture etc. do these people deserve help, absolutely. I’ve known several addicts in my life, but that isn’t to say addiction isn’t a choice. You choose to act on impulse. You choose to seek drugs instead of help. </p>
<p>I shouldn’t have to pay for other peoples’ shit choices in life.</p>

        <p>This isn't entirely true.  A high school diploma won't get you very far and will barely get you a job and it likely won't be decent pay unless you're lucky.  What is a person to do at this point?  Go to college?  Yeah right.  At 50k a year for tuition, it's not feasible for many people, unless they want to go hundreds of thousands into debt.</p>
<p>People start with one shit choice and it can take a hold of their lives, where at that point, they've become addicts and can no longer help themselves to make the right choices because of the addiction.</p>
<p>Eventually one way or another you end up paying taxes when they end up in jail/prison.  When they get out, they typically get $100, a permanent felony record, and no rehabilitation.  It's designed to keep them in this perpetual cycle and you end up continuing to foot the bill.</p>

        <p>Not sure why so many people on this subreddit frame everything as republican vs democrat. Both parties are dumb and some of their actions are evil (and certainly at the top almost all of them self-serving and gross). I wish people would wake up. </p>
<p>To the OP, look at how you are speaking of human beings. I worry for your soul (and I am not even religious). I guess you think it would be OK to throw all of these people in jail. Why not try to come to some understanding of what would drive someone to live their lives completely out of their minds on drugs? Hints: poverty, loss, immense pain. </p>
<p>Decriminalizing drugs is the right thing to do. Ending lockdowns is the right thing to do. Try to see outside the nonsense meant to divide us that both parties are selling. If it pains you that people are shitting on the streets, try to do something meaningful to help them. WWJD if you're into that.</p>
