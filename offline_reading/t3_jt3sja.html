    <strong>I’m glad this sub finally exists</strong>
    <p><p>Alright, when the pandemic STARTED in January, I knew of none of this. None of us did. The world awaited data to come back about the virus. </p>
<p>Around mid April - early may, the height of the fear of covid was rampant. Many of our local economies started shutting down. There was aid. </p>
<p>I think my realization of the situation came around August/September. Now it’s very clear to me what’s happening.</p>
<p>Covid came in (released by China purposely or on accident). Due to the nature of it being a quickly spreading virus, people freaked out. The fear never really went away, even though we have many numbers to glance at now. </p>
<p>Politicians know this. Moreso the media does. And I can’t help but think that the worst part of this virus is now the fact that it’s being used as a Trojan horse for suppressing and stripping the rights away of individuals. Spearheaded by big tech corporations who, undoubtedly, spend heaps of money to generate a narrative which is then pushed out through consumer media outlets. </p>
<p>The narrative is that covid is bad. So bad in fact that every person on the planet needs to be vaccinated. If people refuse vaccination, stores will be equipped with sensors / scanners to detect whether or not a person has been vaccinated. </p>
<p>The narrative is that Donald trump is bad. A racist man. Who lies, and concocts his own narrative to risk the lives of the American people. </p>
<p>That’s <em>the narrative,</em> not the reality. </p>
<p>And what’s both shocking and scary to me is how much more aggressive big tech and the media is becoming with censorship. </p>
<p>And what’s even more worrisome? If the narrative wins, then this will all be seen as okay and acceptable. The bar will be set there. They will further restrict our individual freedoms with more covid “precautions”, until it’s so blatantly obvious that they are controlling the masses that people on that side start questioning. </p>
<p>My issue is, when that questioning starts. When people start to wake up and realize the situation we’re in - will it be too late?</p></p>

        <p>I think you must be 'newly awake' judging by your post. Those of us that have been awake since March when this descent into madness started don't have much hope, it's people like you that need to carry the torch for us!  I'm very bored and tired of arguing and fighting and not seeing anything change - actually, it just gets worse and worse.</p>

        <p>It really grinds my gears when anyone, 'woke' or not, claims the virus is real. All cases, symptoms and deaths can and have been manipulated and/or fabricated, the PCR testing is obviously being used because any result desirable can be achieved, the virus has never been isolated, the same cast and crew behind the AIDS epidemic has returned in the sequel, and of course Kary Mullis own words on the PCR fiasco. Just reading the CDC's own numbers for 30 minutes there is no way you can come away not even questioning Covid's mere existence. Just to name a few smoking guns.</p>
<p>How anyone can accept this 'virus' is real while simultaneously knowing the lockdowns are not for health reasons is beyond me. TPTB will write the history books, so people will never realize the farce, and even if they did it would be too late.</p>

        <p>Also, China LIES, and watches the world burn. China lied about how dangerous and deadly this virus was. They lied about the measures they took, making it seem like they did the most extreme draconian measures. They lied and said those measures worked, therefore if the West wanted to eradicate this virus, they would have to do the same. Now the West has been poisoned by the lies of the eternal lockdowns and there is no getting out of this insane mess. The saddest thing of all? Is that by now, surely all these shills and quacks know that this virus isn't aerosolized ebola, or even on the level of original SARS. They know it's a 0.2% IFR virus, and they know the nature of what it really is, and that trying to contain it is as futile as trying to contain a common cold. But they still deliberately act like the complete opposite...because they are far too deep into this psychosis to back out now. They cover for their own asses and don't care how much damage and destruction they are causing.</p>

        <p>Not sure if I agree I think sometimes we have to experience the worst before we can find the balance. Right now it feels like an end and it is, it’s the climax of a terrible world that was set in motion when the committee of 300 was created. Destruction of the old paves the opportunity for the new. I’m not talking about the “new normal” technocrat bs either. The new is when we slowly begin to observe the consequences of fear based action. It won’t happen overnight but there are more people figuring it out and realizing what’s going on then you think....</p>

        <p>I knew about this shit in January. I started compiling n95sa nd gave them to everyone I knew over 50. I bought a month of canned goods (that I still have lol)  I fought with work about social distancing and by the time they started enforcing mask restrictions I left. A fair space to work is a lot better than forcing 6 employees into a broom closet and telling them to wear masks. I'm not against safeguarding against covid but when you force others to compensate for your own failures is where I draw the line. The only positive outcome from covid is that workers rights may improve if we all stand together</p>

        <p>Well evidence is officially out from Sweden which shows there is NO CORRELATION between wearing a mask and not. </p>
<p>Further - their DEATH RATE is similar to that of recent years. </p>
<p>This is a country that collectively DOES NOT wear masks.</p>

        <p>I'm kind of indifferent on masks. I think there's been enough data with hairdressers and doctors to admit that they are somewhat effective. I worked in a covid positive home today and wore a face shield, n95 and a smock and gloves. I didnt feel I needed the smock, gloves and face shield, but in this extreme case I was happy to wear an n95. I spent most of my time outside with the door open watching my wards. Cloth masks though are basically trash and I wore a bandana until I started working with vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>I think social distancing is the most important factor</p>
<p>But I in no way advocate shutdowns.</p>

<p>Huh, makes you wonder if corporations are actually funding the "no mask, no lockdown" talk, doesn't it?</p>
<p>Tell me, was it your idea to oppose masks or lockdowns or did you pick it up in media?</p>

        <p>I had never considered that. Mostly because corporate giants that permeate multiple levels of business are doing great. I don’t doubt some corporations got hurt but Amazon has never done better. And then you have the people invested in the vaccine—that’s gonna be a huge money maker. </p>
<p>That is an interesting point though and I’ll look more in to it. However, I don’t think it’s necessarily about money but totalitarian control. The elite has divided us in to red an blue and in to races when the real issue is its us, the common folk, against the mega rich. They pull the strings on world leading puppets. </p>
<p>This conflict isn’t monetary or physical it’s literally against the human spirit and people are just folding over and taking it. </p>
<p>And I have never ever seen any news media whatsoever tell me not to wear a mask, that this is all overblown nonsense etc. The only people I’ve seen say so are independent doctors and researchers that I highly doubt have an organized agenda or the massive amounts of money to back them. </p>
<p>Please please please show me a corporate news outlet saying these things. I used to be all about the lockdown etc but exercising my own free thinking and not jumping on to a fear mongering bandwagon has led me here. I feel that most people on this sub are genuinely rational. Skepticism is healthy and in this age of misinformation when all sorts of shit doesn’t add up it’s needed more than ever.</p>

        <p>Thanks for being open to think about it.</p>
<p>Of course there are some companies that did well, but even so, most companies had unexpected expenses (extra safety, extra masks, less people in office, useless rental agreements). </p>
<p>Real-estate office lending is dead. Travel-agencies are in the toilet. Airtravel is fucked. Nobody in their right mind wants this to continue. </p>
<p>Vaccines are not a massive profit maker, they are mostly a solid revenue stream (think of the flu vaccine).</p>
<p>There will also be instant revenue pressure on the pharma companies to distribute this as close to cost as possible because they will want to make sure it reaches the entire world.</p>
<p>Sure there will be some money made, there's nothing wrong with that as long as it's in the general interest.</p>
<p><strong>Control</strong>: look, there will be overreach, for sure. In normal times, without any context asking people to stay at home would be instantly suspicios.</p>
<p>Telling your entire population to stop going out missing the context of the pandemic would be concerning for sure.</p>
<p>But we have context. There are countries much poorer than the US struggling to control the pandemic without all the money and capabilities of the US. They are barely holding on. </p>
<p>This didn't start as a cabal of interests planning a takeover it was literally scrambling to get some time to prepare for the full impact of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Sure, some people will profit, there is a chance some liberties will be taken away and that should be pushed against. Hard. When this is over. </p>
<p>On mask / anti-lockdown : I will direct you to the US President Donald Trump, the single most important source on misinformation in the pandemic.
He has been whishy washy on masks, saying they are optional on day 1. Didn't wear one until fucking July. He literally opposed lockdowns. He suggested all sorts of idiotic cures that got people killed. </p>
<p>When the media reflected his words, were they supportive or critical? Look back and see. You will have found your influencers.</p>

        <p>I think that people get et up about control because they do not see the effects of this virus. The media tells us one thing, and in real life, it doesn’t add up. Any amount of control being imposed upon us based off the just ok science is unjustified. PCR tests are not a standalone determiner of whether someone has an infectious disease. The man who invented the thing said so. And the results from these machines that give us data are easily misinterpreted. Cases do not equate to infectious diseased humans. Meanwhile, the IFR for Covid is 99%</p>
<p>For a lot of people this is enough to shut everything down and put people in jail or fine them because even .03% of the population is still a lot of people dying. I see the compassion there and I think they mean well in their hearts. Others would take the value of living your life to the fullest over the deaths of .03% of the world. It sounds cruel but relative to other causes of death, this has been how we’ve always done it. </p>
<p>I’ll look up about media supporting Trump and his anti lockdown narrative. I think it got drowned out in the sea of pro-lockdown narrative. Though who knows with the all powerful algorithms. </p>
<p>I feel for the other countries struggling with this issue. It’s far worse for them than it is for Americans. Where you and I disagree is if it’s been a planned event or not. I definitely want to believe the government and world leaders have our best interests at heart but unfortunately, based off my meandering experience and observations of the world for all my years I find their SUDDEN compassion nothing short of hypocritical and suspicious.</p>

        <p>What Kary Mullis said is that PCR is not the single determinant of a disease.</p>
<p>PCR is not supposed to be a diagnostic. It's supposed to CONFIRM a diagnostic.</p>
<p>Remember that you get tested when there are symptoms. You have some sort of reason to get tested. </p>
<p>Those are symptoms. CDC has specific requirements on who should get tested in order to not randomly test people. Notice how you don't get offered a test when going into a restaurant? It's because there are rules around using them.</p>
<p>We don't know the actual IFR of Covid because we don't have a completely accurate picture of how many infections there are. It can only be guestimated. 
What we do know is CFR (case fatality ratio) which varies by country. From 1% to 10% or more.</p>
<p>Don't mistake my supporting of the official narrative with the assumption that I think governments are doing a good job or that they are truly interested in doing a good job.
They care far more about not losing money via the economy being in the shitter.</p>
<p>But there are true public servants in the world though. They are rarely in true positions of power however.</p>

        <p>I am pretty sure that people who are asymptomatic are getting tested as well. Which in turn could absolutely inflate numbers. To the degree at which that is happening is hard to know, and there’s a lot of conflicting info. </p>
<p>I’ve also heard that covid 19 hasn’t passed all of Koch’s postulates, a method to determine that viral material is the cause of something. What do you think about that? </p>
<p>Even looking at this from a 30,000 ft view, there is a wealth of conflicting information and yet extreme measures are being taken anyway. Just because it’s not on the mainstream media doesn’t mean many many many people disagree w what’s going. So the sheer lack of things not being rock solidly explained, to me, is telling. If this were as serious as they say I think without the news and “experts” relaying the same thing day in and day out we would still see it. Not in how the government or economy reacts, but in our day to day lives. People aren’t dying in the streets. We can still go to the grocery store and buy veggies in the open air. The mask rule at restaurants where you wear it to your table then you’re fine is ridiculous to me, yet it is accepted as rational...</p>
<p>And I agree about public servants out there truly wanting what’s best and not having a voice or position of power. Which to me is also telling. Because many of them disagree w what’s going on. </p>
<p>In general I’ve never seen a stance as unique as yours! Haha distrust in the government, yet trusting the narrative they push. I think governments are either pro lockdown or they’re being coerced in to it by media and don’t want to look like the bad guy. </p>
<p>Not to mention, the main funding source for WHO is Bill Gates. The computer man. And he suddenly has say in world health policy? Calls himself a health expert and that nothing is gonna be better until we take his vaccine haha I mean it’s just crazy. Arrogant at best.</p>

        <p>Ok, I can answer these</p>
<p>So 1st, there are rules on who should get tested https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html#who-should-get-tested</p>
<p>2nd, Kochs postulates apply to bacteria, not viruses. Koch didn't know viruses existed but he did discover a bunch of pathogenic bacteria.
In order to match the postulates, viruses need additional modification to the rules. Here for example is the Koch postulates with the Rivers modifications fullfiled for SARS 1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095368/</p>
<p>3rd. People not explaining clearly is certaintly happening. I'm going to give you a hard thing to do but find the "This Week in Virology" podcast. Those are scientists (virologists and immunologists) discussion the pandemic. It's the best source on the internet and you will learn a lot. Don't worry if it gets technical, just power through. They start discussing in Jan - Feb and there are hundreds of episodes done more several times per week.</p>
<p>Restaurants (indoors) should be closed, the fact they are open in the US is a massive risk for everyone involved.</p>
<p>4th The narrative is fact. The virus exists, people get sick, many die and we need to take measures. Are the governments that got dealt this the best to handle it? No. Are at least some of them profiting of it? Yes. I can't change that, but it doesn't mean I should ignore the health advice.</p>
<p>Bill Gates has been involved in health policy for decades and while him having obscene wealth is obscene, the fact that he's using at least some part of it for good is OK. </p>
<p>He's been pushing the eradication of polio for quite some time and that is a net good for the world. </p>
<p>He supports vaccines and development of new vaccines, and that's good for the world. </p>
<p>He does not call himself an expert, he's just relaying the facts as told to him by experts. In that I believe he's quite modest for an obscenely wealthy man.</p>
<p>The fact is, things will only get better if we have an antiviral (take a pill and destroy the virus) and a vaccine (prevent getting sick or spreading).
Chances are that a vaccine comes first in which case that's something to be on board with.</p>
<p>Listen, I sat in my house for 4 weeks after 2 "contact" scares. My fear was not getting sick and dying but getting out while asymptomatic and infecting others.</p>
<p>We need to care for other people.</p>

<p>A mask mandate would simply involve fines if not wearing in public.</p>
<p>And while we can talk about fines being ok or not, protecting other people is a mandate in a society.</p>
