        <p>Did you read the article? Because the Title here of "Fauci emails disturbingly seem to show coordinated attempt to hide the US role in releasing the COVID bioweapon." has no relation to the article and the article is titled "Fauci Team Scrambled in January 2020 to Respond to Lab Leak Allegations, Emails Show" which is not at all what the emails show. The article does go through a series of emails and describes the redactions, and shows that Fauci and a bunch of other scientists shared an article about the virus. That article had two sentences out of 17 paragraphs that had something to do with the virus escaping from a lab. The author of this article speculates that all the meetings and discussions about the article were concerning those two sentences and nothing else. That's almost the entirety of the article, speculating about what phone calls and emails that we don't have were about. Whoever wrote the title to the article had to know it was misleading, that was the point.</p>

        <p>I wish this was actually a subreddit of skeptical people instead of just authoritarians who want to be spoon fed the type of propaganda that confirms their biases.</p>
