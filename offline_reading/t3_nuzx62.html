    <strong>Why does anyone willfully choose to live in CA or NYC?</strong>
    <p><p>As someone who's lived in the Deep South for my entire life, I can't even fathom why anyone would make the decision to continue to live in CA or NYC after the events of the last year. </p>
<p>In those "progressive wonderlands", the state is able to shut down your business if you do not comply with COVID regulations, you can lose your job for not being vaccinated/masked, and there are no signs of attempting to loosen up restrictions. Only tightening, and increasing social controls.</p>
<p>And, that's not even getting into the massive amounts of corruption from the top down in those states, homelessness, horrible crime rates, and astronomical housing prices. People are paying half a million on the low end to buy a house in areas with no real personal freedom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, down here, there was never any real enforcement of mask mandates. Most Southern states have completely reopened 100%, and most businesses are marketed at the door as "mask optional".</p>
<p>You still see people wearing masks, but it's entirely their own personal decision to do so. Same with the vaccine, haven't heard of any employers requiring it down here. </p>
<p>So, why would anyone choose to spend loads of money to live in an area with no freedom?</p></p>
