    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>This is a very misleading video, and really it's damaging as such misinformation covers up the reality of why coronavirus is such a nothingburger.</p>
<p>The video talks of a number of lab confirmed cases of flu and pneumonia and contrasts that to a estimate of flu and pneumonia deaths. Of course we simply don't lab test for flu and pneumonia.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The video then shows flu and pneumonia deaths on a graph dropping while deaths attributed to ncov19 rise. However that is misleading as the coronavirus19 epidemic happened in the west as the flu season was ending.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2019-2020/images/ILI33_small.gif">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2019-2020/images/ILI33_small.gif</a> This is a graph of ILI activity, which is Influenza-Like-Infection; it's the reality of whether people are experiencing some respiratory infection and being able to estimate how many.</p>
<p>At the bottom you see the weeks and so we see these large curves every year from October to February.</p>
<p>The red line is 2020. Notice how that most years there is 2 spikes, and that is epidemics of different strains of influenza.</p>
<p>Also notice how that they rapidly peak and decline in the middle of flu season - that is herd immunity; every year the flu epidemics end not simply because of the end of winter months but also because we develop herd immunity where the fraction of population who were susceptible are infected and then become immune.</p>
<p>A high degree of herd immunity to a respiratory virus only takes around 3 weeks to develop. Generally it comes for 2 weeks, and then it goes for 2 weeks, and then it's done, though you'll have some enclaves which by happenstance were not exposed to it and they may have a mini epidemic in locales whenever in the year.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Notice that 2020 has an unusual Third Spike.</p>
<p>That is March.</p>
<p>That is coronavirus epidemic.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of Americans were infected with this in March.</p>
<p>It drops at the end of March.</p>
<p>That is herd immunity in much of the U.S.A in March.</p>
<p>This means the spread of the infection was late February and early March, as those who are infected with a respiratory virus and experience symptoms usually develop such around a week later.</p>
<p>And then deaths lag behind infections so we see deaths in April. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm</a> scroll down to the graph and you see excess deaths. See how it rapidly drops in April, similarly you can go through states and see sharp drop back to normal in April. We see some U.S southern states go up later, similarly we see that unusual summer bump on ILI chart of U.S hot states.</p>
<p>Also consider this excess death isn't just coronavirus but it is the lockdown causing many excess deaths too (and those will really hit later on with all the tens of thousands of people who avoided being diagnosed with cancer, and not only late diagnosis but also the backlog will overwhelm these resources so in future lack of treatment).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This video downplays flu and pneumonia, but the reality is that the numbers it is referencing are enormous underestimations of flu and pneumonia deaths.</p>
<p>Every year hundreds of thousands of Americans die of common respiratory infections.</p>
<p>It's just a matter of how do we interpret cause of death?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Europe mortality is good example as flu and pneumonia deaths are so very seasonal there <a href="https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps">https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps</a> This is very important, it's the reality of how humans in temperate climates largely die in winter which this stupid tin foil hat water filter salesman video can't deal with.</p>
<p>Notice the big spike, that's the coronavirus epidemic, but the volume underneath the curves is the amount of death.</p>
<p>coronavirus comes and goes very quickly so it spikes unusually high, but really it's not a large amount of death. Consider the bottom of the graph is 0, even look at the number of the peak of coronavirus is only 88k, but usual winter flu drives weekly deaths up to 70k and look how protracted those winter curves are with enormous volume underneath the lines.</p>
<p>Look at those larges curves every winter.</p>
<p>Take the summer baseline and then add up the number of deaths each winter on the summer baseline. I can tell you what it roughly is:</p>
<p>Winter 2016/2017 is 300,000 deaths.</p>
<p>Winter 2017/2018 is around 400,000 deaths.</p>
<p>The coronavirus spike is only around 100,000 - 150,000 deaths, and that's not controlling for deaths caused by lockdown.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Those 300,000 deaths are simply seasonal common respiratory infections - in fact it's more than 300,000 as deaths from accidents etc drop in winter.</p>
<p>There isn't something else causing that increase in winter.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Every winter around two times to three times as many people die of flu and pneumonia as the number of deaths from coronavirus epidemic.</p>
<p>Everything I've said here is the simple reality of what people need to know, then they can know how stupid this coronavirus issue is - it fucking started and ended in March in most of the west; most of the west had herd immunity back in March.</p>
<p>You're concerned with:</p>
<p>ILI and Excess Death</p>
<p>You're not concerned with:</p>
<p>Cases and so-called coronavirus deaths.</p>
<p>Stupid people look at Cases and 'Coronavirus Deaths'</p>
<p>It's all about ILI and Excess Death.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then you combine that with the other simple reality:</p>
<p>If you delay herd immunity you prolong the time that vulnerable need to isolate and so you get more vulnerable people killed.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And third:</p>
<p>We can say in Europe every winter around 300,000 to 400,000 people die of flu and pneumonia.</p>
<p>We can say that the coronavirus epidemic killed around 100,000 to 150,000 people.</p>
<p>But in reality virtually no one dies of flu, no one dies of pneumonia, no one dies of coronaviruses, no one dies of this new ncov19 virus. People die of ageing, obesity, chronic smoking, neurological disease, cancer etc.</p>
<p>These common respiratory infections are just what finishes you off.</p>
<p>Often it's a blessing. They end suffering.</p>
<p>That's why we call Pneumonia <strong><em>OLD MAN'S FRIEND.</em></strong></p>
