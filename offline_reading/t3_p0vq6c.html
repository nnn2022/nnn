    <strong>Australia in the future</strong>
    <p><p>All countries end up living with the virus, some do vaccine passports but drop them eventually. Countries like Australia keep on rolling lockdowns throughout the year. It starts out rudimentary but gets more advanced and accepted each year.  Everybody requires carry a phone app or gov provided device for lockdown indicator and you must gps check in at home, all automated. Lockdowns are capable targetting precise location or demographic. All they have to do is sign a deal with Facebook. There is a new tax introduced to subsitize your employers to guaranteed paid lockdown days. Many people are excited for the days off. The new tax becomes the norm. Everybody is required to keep up on their health pass. Over the next century government continues to inch in on complete control. Citizens don't speak up because they lost the war many years ago.</p>
<p>we look at Australia like a mix between China and North Korea without the military power.</p></p>

        <p>Well Australians and the kiwis are basically Europeans when it comes to their love of subjugation. </p>
<p>In the land of the free however, not gonna happen. I could see Alaska and Texas and probably the entire southern US seceding before that happened.</p>

        <p>That's what happens when you have a constitutional monarchy instead of a constitutional republic.  You give one party the power to both interpret and enforce the rules for everybody.  Plus they gave up their guns.</p>

        <p>it's more of a case of our elected representatives not speaking out in fear of getting pushed out of the inner sanctum of the party room. They are told to toe the line or else.</p>
<p>One party doesn't really get the power, as the parliament is made up of minor parties also, meaning that for the elected party to get anything by they need to make deals to get the numbers needed<br>
The head of state is a formal, symbolic and ceremonial position, as opposed to the position of head of government, which has the administrative power to govern the country In Australia the powers of the Queen have been delegated by the Australian Constitution to her representative in Australia, the Governor-General. That is, while Australia’s head of state is the Queen, the functions of head of state are performed by the Governor-General. The Queen’s only necessary constitutional function is to appoint the Governor-General, and in doing this the Queen acts as advised by the Australian Prime Minister. The Constitution gives the Queen the power to disallow an Australian Act of Parliament, but this has never been done and it is extremely unlikely that it would ever be done.</p>
