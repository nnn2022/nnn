    <strong>STOP with the New Zealand &amp; Australia comparisons, it won't work.</strong>
    <p><p>What do you expect? Stay in lockdown until all cases have been irradicated? This is an impossible policy. Vaccines aren't 100 per cent effective. New Zealand and Australia will need to open their borders eventually and even with a 100% inoculated population, they will still have cases and deaths. What are they going to do?</p>
<p>Continue to lockdown huge states forever due to one case? They'll go bust. Social unrest etc.</p>
<p>This looks great for the egos of these two countries RIGHT NOW (who by the way are at the arse end of the world) but the future looks remarkably bleak due to their zero COVID policy. One case invokes a lockdown. There will ALWAYS be cases. Always.</p>
<p>Social structures are different in NZ &amp; AUS. In the UK, a portion of our young key workers are likely to share a home with up to 6 other people, all attending different jobs (potentially key ones) and mixing at the end of the day. University students live in close proximity within student accommodation This isn't common in Australia.</p>
<p>The population is coherently lower, the UK has almost double the population size of both countries confined into space 10% smaller than New Zealand.</p>
<p>Australia has committed human rights abuses, such as preventing their own citizens from returning home leaving them stranded in foreign countries due to flight caps and astronomical flight prices on returning flights.</p>
<p>On the surface, the policy of zero COVID looks great, but is it really? What are the costs?</p></p>

        <p>Here is a fantastic read by Adam Creighton of the Australian.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/coronavirus-lockdown-lunacy-is-frying-our-minds/news-story/f1a4cd6bc7ede2e363ff6badd78ab0d0">https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/coronavirus-lockdown-lunacy-is-frying-our-minds/news-story/f1a4cd6bc7ede2e363ff6badd78ab0d0</a></p>
<p>Key quote:</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand have incurred costs equivalent to a world war — and more than any other nation has — fighting a pandemic that has killed not even 1000 people, with a median age in the mid-80s, between them. And this is widely seen as brilliant.</p>

        <p>Comparing the US to any other country in the sense of this virus is ridiculous. New Zealand is easily the most egregious, though. There's essentially nothing truly comparable between the countries, particularly when you consider how freedoms, liberties, and rights are paramount to US culture and history. Whereas New Zealand is more than happy to give the middle finger to freedoms, liberties, and rights at every possible turn, and bend straight over for their government in the process.</p>
<p>No country truly has a handle on this virus, and we're a year in. Continued mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns (especially at this stage) will do nothing. Just the notion that they'll, in any capacity, be a cure-all for this virus, is total lunacy.</p>

        <p>Agreed. At this point, a year or more into this... it is time to admit the truth.</p>
<p>Masks do bupkiss to stop CoVid-19.</p>
<p>Lockdowns do bupkiss to stop CoVid-19.</p>
<p>Even social distancing does not do bupkiss to stop it as shown by the NUMEROUS people living in private homes who have NOT gone out for 6 months further than 6 feet from their homes and STILL are catching CoVid-19.</p>

        <p>The purpose of all of this is to normalize absolute government control and a total surveillance state.</p>
<p>Once it becomes normalized to lock down for every case, the next step is universal vaccination and restriction of freedom of movement for those who don’t comply.</p>
<p>Many will happily comply with this up to and including invisible ink or rfid or microchip tracking if it lets them back into pubs or watching football games in person.</p>
<p>They don’t see the news or politicians or corrupt pharmaceutical industries as the issue.</p>
<p>They see their neighbors—you and me—as the enemy.</p>

        <p>The "good" thing about the Australian situation is that you get to see the effects of the vaccination on the population without having confusing "cross talk" from the virus.</p>
<p>If a bunch of people are dropping after being vaccinated in Australia, they cant blame it on virus.</p>
<p>(Watch a huge "covid outbreak" happen just as the vaccine rollout starts)</p>
<p>EDIT - As I said that I decided to check on the Aussie rollout timeline.  It's supposed to start in February.  I guess that means it will really get rolling over the June - August window?  That would coincide with Australian winter virus season, wouldnt it?   I wonder if they will have mysterious "covid surge" during that period?</p>

        <p>Just to maybe show the ridiculousness of Australia; I'm from Singapore that have had 1 locally transmitted case in the last 14 days. This is apparently a massive risk for Australia and has banned me from entry, despite me having a valid visa to be there since 2018.          <br>
If THATS how risk-averse they are being I can't even imagine them opening up to Europe or USA by 2023 earliest if they continue at this pace. They really think they can keep this up forever.</p>
