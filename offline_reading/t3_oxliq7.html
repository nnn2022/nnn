    <strong>r/AHS claims this sub is “pure propaganda” and a “conspiracy club.” Pot calling the kettle black much? But is this sub tolerant, even receptive, to cordial debate and differences?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m a long-time lurker using my alt because of the oppressive auto-ban policy of other subreddits. </p>
<p>Personally, I’m fully vaccinated. But I completely understand the skepticism surrounding covid vaccines. Mainly, that mRNA is a new technology that was rushed thru the approval process without any of the usual care and prudence. And the biopharmaceutical industry doesn’t exactly have a good track record of forthcoming honesty and transparency. Meanwhile one only needs to scantly glance at the FDA’s collusion w big pharma during the AIDS crisis to doubt the Agency’s claims of being apolitical, nonpartisan, and independent. Finally, the CDC has been so all over the place, so slow in response, and so plain hapless at times during this pandemic that your faith in it should be shaken, if not completely destroyed. So, skepticism is a totally reasonable position to me. </p>
<p>And yet, skeptics are either treated as whackadoodle ignoramuses or poor victims of far-right propaganda both IRL and especially here on Reddit. The majority of this site makes Chomsky look like Reagan so its not surprising they conflate “trust science” with “the consensus of the ‘experts’ is authoritative and shall not be questioned” but still, there’s usually a healthy appetite for anti-authoritarianism. I mean, you’re upvoted into oblivion if you suggest a mass conspiracy among the thousands of local police jurisdictions to senselessly murder as many black Americans as possible. But if you dare raise a question  about the possibility of a long-term effect from an mRNA-based vaccination,  immediate downvote or subreddit BAN! </p>
<p>It’s barely any better for skeptics irl, at least in the elitist coastal enclave I live in. Personally, most everyone I know is vaccinated. And yet, EVERYONE is freaking out about this delta variant. Sure, you still carry a 30-40% chance of catching it, but you’re ~87% protected against symptoms and 99% against serious illness or death. I seriously cannot understand the freak out. </p>
<p>Again, I personally have no reason to seriously suspect mRNA may pose unknown dangers (but ofc no one knows for sure) and because I care for my 96-year-old grandmother, getting vaccinated was the right choice for me. But I deliberated, did my research, weighed the risks vs rewards, and came to that decision with thought and care. Now, I’m watching the delta variant with the reasonable expectation it’s not a question of if, but when I’ll catch it. And I can’t figure out what the fuss is all about? The “doom and gloom” headlines coupled with my state’s return to masks and restrictions makes me sad and angry. </p>
<p>But I suspect this is the only sub that would tolerate such a reaction. And despite our differences, I hope y’all will tolerate me posting here.</p></p>

        <p>Same boat, vaxxed, but the other subs (and media in general) have become fanatical to the extreme, driven more by paranoia than the actual data. I supported the mandates in the beginning, but based on the data the "curve" is beyond flattened and I'm ready to return to normal life. The new mandates make zero sense, hence why I'm here.</p>

        <p>You are welcome. I accepted the astrazenica  jabs but wouldn't have taken the mRNA ones as they have no long term safety record. No-one here has ever seemed to have a problem with that. My basic position is that the advent of a novel flu-like illness is in ABSOLUTELY NO WAY a sufficient justification for our society to undergo a psychotic break and be railroaded into erecting a bizarre authoritarian dystopia of segregation, medical coercion, fear and poverty where human rights and other norms are routinely trampled.</p>

        <p>Just for context, here are the reasons r/againsthatesubreddits would like to see this sub quarantined, along with my own question/comment/opinion, which I urge others to contribute to where I am wrong or fall short. </p>
<ol>
<li>Spreading misinformation that downplays covid death numbers </li>
</ol>
<p>There are perfectly reasonable questions to ask about covid death totals, as what was considered covid-related or covid-caused varied from state to state. For example, my Aunt died of a myocardial infarction (heart attack) a few weeks after contracting Covid. Her death was considered covid-related. She was also extremely obese, however, and had a history of heart issues. Another state, or even hospital, might have a different classification. Even The NY Times reported that the number of official covid deaths was wrong, albeit they reported it as significantly undercounting the number of deaths. But nevertheless, it proves the point that there is a healthy, diverse debate over the real number of deaths. </p>
<p>And I rarely see posts downplaying official covid statistics, anyway? Those more involved in this sub daily- is downplaying the number of covid deaths a routine occurrence? Does anyone here deny a lot of Americans (in the 100k’s) died of Covid? </p>
<p>Anyhow, does downplaying the death numbers really help advance this sub’s main raison d’être- providing a space for vaccination skeptics to discuss their concerns with each other? I guess it could marginally contribute to one’s reason to not get vaccinated, if say, they’re an 85 year old Reddit user and are led to underestimate their mortality risk. But that seems like a stretch. </p>
<ol>
<li>Spreading fear about the mRNA vaccine </li>
</ol>
<p>This is certainly characteristic of this sub, although I’d replace “fear” with “doubt”. That’s the purpose of scientific inquiry… to doubt. To act as if mRNA technology has the historical track record of Advil is to be willfully ignorant. It’s an entirely new, potentially game-changing era of vaccinology. But what we know is at least equal (if not outweighed) by what we do not know. It would normally take like 8 years for a vaccine of this type to gain regulatory approval. The FDA fast tracked the approval process to about 8 months. Out of necessity. Which is reasonable. But very smart scientists are reasonably skeptical, as well. </p>
<p>We were told there was an unquestionable consensus of scientific opinion that the virus started in a bat cave, and in no way could have been caused by unnatural circumstances. Today, more scientists than not I think believe (or at least don’t dismiss) that covid was caused by a lab leak at the Wuhan Virology Lab. So, skepticism is healthy. </p>
<ol>
<li>Purely propagandistic of conspiracy theories that discourage people from protecting themselves and others from Covid </li>
</ol>
<p>Purely propagandistic? If that’s the criteria, than about half the subs on Reddit ought to be banned, against r/ahs. </p>
<p>Of conspiracy theories?Remember The_Mueller? Remember r/politics in the months leading up to the election? There’s a sub called r/conspiracy that no one has suggested banning. </p>
<p>That discourages people from protecting themselves? This sub is a self-contained community that has and will never see the front page of Reddit. The only way you see it is if you’re skeptical yourself and looking for it. </p>
<p>That also presupposes people are idiots who only do what they are told to do. So, ALL the information must be identical, and encourage them to do exactly what we (the folks at r/ahs) know is best for them. People can check out this sub, then check out r/coronavirus and come to their own conclusion. </p>
<p>The end.</p>

        <p>I will gladly get the vaccine when I think its necessary and when I'm comfortable that it's safe. I applaud anyone who got the vaccine. My mom and dad both got the vaccine and I didn't think they ever would. So I am not routing for people to die if they got it. That would mean I'm routing on my parents, friends and other family to die. In my mind I haven't got the confirmation that I'm looking for. There has been too much misinformation on both sides and it's hard to tell what is what. If you are 100% confident the vaccine is safe and effective. Well that's awesome. If you are 100% sure you will never get the vaccine. That's cool too. I'm not you. I debate with myself constantly on which is the better choice. My argument with myself on why I'm not getting it yet is I can try to avoid covid if I really tried. If I get covid I can do what ever I can to try to beat it. Getting the vaccine right now is a choice. No matter what your government or jobs says it's still a choice. I know once I make that choice there is no going back and I will have to face the good and the bad. But since I have a choice. I'm choosing to go with chance.</p>

        <p>They're a sub well known for posting illegal content in other subs to get them banned.</p>
<p>Specifically illegal content involving images of people under a certain age.</p>
<p>How they haven't been reported to the fbi I do not understand.</p>

        <p>I wish. It’s called against hate subreddits. They’re basically the gestapo of Reddit. If a sub doesn’t fall in line with their woke progressivism, they brigade it or push admins to quarantine and ban it. </p>
<p>They took down the Donald. They took down all the dark humor and ironically racist joke subs. They’re the worst.</p>

        <p>Operation Warp Speed is thanks to Trump.<br>
I don’t know about you but I trust him. He trusted the fine people at Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre when they gave him an experimental drug treatment.<br>
Biden is just riding on his coat-tails and trying to take credit for Operation Warp Speed.</p>
