    <strong>If it helps</strong>
    <p><p>I had Covid in March. Obviously this is SUBJECTIVE but I would choose having this again over the common cold.   </p>
<p>21st of March I stayed up all night to buy toilet roll at 6am here in the UK.  </p>
<p>I had a bit of an itchy throat, kind of where you are 50/50 on whether you might feel sick later or fine, could go either way. By 11am the passage from my throat to my nose had that dry feeling where I know I am about to have a cold, so I was 99% sure I was going to be sick.  </p>
<p>Slept all day, woke up around 8pm in the evening (if I remember) - I had a fever. I was not feeling hot, I felt really cold, and my body felt sensitive to touch (a fever). I had a really dull ache in my legs and lower back, I felt tired. My nose felt slightly blocked, so I took an allergy tablet. I had a super mild cough, no different to on a normal day where you may wake up and you have a little cough for no apparent reason. I wouldn't have even thought I was sick from the cough, so mild, I probably shouldn't even mention it. More like having to clear your throat a bit.  </p>
<p>Went to bed about 11pm I think, felt so tired, I was able to sleep again. Woke up Sunday 22nd with no fever, just a milder version of the previous day's blocked nose. Took another allergy tablet (anti histamine) and felt fine.  </p>
<p>Monday 23rd, back to normal.  </p>
<p>On the Wednesday or Thursday of the same week, I suddenly had a burning sensation in my nose, like I had sniffed salt or chilli or vinegar. It just really stung inside my nostrils. My nose was running more this time and I sneezed a bit, but no fever and did not feel sick. Took an allergy tablet.  </p>
<p>Within a day or two, was completely fine again - other than my sense of smell completely went. Now I cannot ever remember a time in my entire life where my smell has gone completely, but my nose is not blocked. Not blocked in the slightest, but I cannot smell anything, and my taste is at about 5%. This did not change for 3 weeks! A solid 3 weeks, to the point I was scared I would never taste food again! I tried smelling the strongest things I could find like fabric conditioner, nothing.  </p>
<p>I never got tested, but losing my smell for 3 weeks with no blocked nose was a dead giveaway.  </p>
<p>I have none of these 'long covid' symptoms, and I wish every time I had a cold it was like this. The common cold or flu is at least 100 times worse. It shocked me to think what I had was causing so much death. I am 32, and healthy.  </p>
<p>The greatest damage done by this virus has been to my mental health, not out of fear, but from the restrictions affecting my every day life on a personal level in so many ways.  </p>
<p>It's airborne, masks aren't going to stop this other than catching your coughs and sneezes. Standing 2m won't help. The case fatality rate is far too low to be ruining our lives.   </p>
<p>If you're under 45 and reasonably healthy, with just the most basic of regular exercise and vitamins, believe me, do not be scared at all. It is not the plague.</p></p>

        <p>I got it too and told everyone I’d prefer it to a cold as well!! Every time I get a cold I’m sick for about 6 weeks. Not incapacitated, but not feeling well enough to exercise and have congestion and a cough. I’ve been to the doctor about it and they always just say some people have this reaction to colds and just have to wait it out. With Covid I did feel pretty bad for a day or 2, but then I was completely better about a week after getting it without any annoying symptoms hanging on! And aside from the 2 days that sucked, the rest of the time I felt well enough to do pretty much everything except exercising. It was mildly annoying at most. </p>
<p>Oh, and laying on my stomach for about 30 minutes took away all chest pain and made breathing easy for the next 4-5 hours on the days I wasn’t feeling well. Which wasn’t that common knowledge for chest congestion since forever?? I’ve always done that with any chest congestion.</p>
