    <strong>It's not going to get better, is it?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm so tired of living in what feels like an airport security checkpoint crossed with a daycare.</p>
<p>Tired of being gaslighted into feeling like a bioweapon.</p>
<p>Tired of feeling like a 'patient' or a test subject that needs to be 'tested' and monitored all the time.</p>
<p>I'm just tired of the rules, especially the encroaching surveillance and hearing about coronavirus 24/7 even if I don't watch the news. I see the signs everywhere, I see the masks and merch everywhere. Fucking inescapable.</p>
<p>Some people here might be mad and say "I'm a pussy" for wearing a mask to avoid being approached, and the brigaders will be mad because I simply don't like the rules. It's not about the masks to me, though, because no, a few minutes in a mask is not "hard". It's ridiculous, not <em>hard</em>. </p>
<p>It's the surveillance, tracking apps, vaccine apps, the fact that we're <em>blaming</em> each other over illness, the extreme division that is hard to swallow. It's the atmosphere. The permanence, I see things being completely rebuilt to conform in my town. It's a straight up aesculapian nightmare- yet the nursing home got covid and no one was even hospitalized- much less died. I know 5 people who have had it now and they've all recovered at home.
 I can't wrap my head around <em>why</em> we're doing this. At first I thought it was just the media's cash cow, but the restrictions only keep tightening. I don't feel like it's ever going to get better.</p>
<p>You can only "get some fresh air and exercise!" For so long until you wish life in general felt good again. If it's not better by summer 2021 I think I'll consider suicide. (Cue the lifesaving heroes telling me to go ahead and do it)</p></p>

        <p>Yes, it will get better. About 50% of society are already pushing back against this nonsense, you just do not see it in the MSM because it would debunk the meme that they are trying to push.</p>

        <p>I live in Colorado. Everyone everywhere is masked up and they're actually rebuilding certain things to promote 'social distancing' and stuff. My university does covid checks every day and checks the sewage lmao. Feel like I live in a test subject ward. </p>
<p>I'm so tired of being gaslighted into believing I'm sick. I almost wanna do classes online, or at the very least rent an off campus place.</p>
<p>I really hope you're right and it does go away. I hope I'm not pushing 30 by the time it stops.</p>

        <p>This is happening because people like you are too afraid of confrontation and just comply instead. Taking the easy way out now will only make it harder for you in the future, and could possibly make it impossible for the next generation of children to fight back against.</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry. The truth is, we have no idea what the future may hold. There's <em>hints</em> of what may come, like from the leaked Canadian government documents. But that's not set in stone yet. Problem is, we need more resistance than what's been going on. We need more mass protests, along with mass civil disobedience. The sad fact is that people are mostly going along with this, many are even embracing the changes being done to society.</p>
<p>I share your frustration with the common advice of "get some fresh air and exercise". Going outdoors is only going to do so much, and some places even have restrictions on doing that. It's difficult, and horrendous. Nothing like this has ever happened before in the history of humanity, a global "lockstep" exercise of this sort, that's placed billions under life changing restrictions. So many regurgitate the same type of advice given to those with depression and the like, which just doesn't work in this instance.</p>
<p>I wish I had better words of comfort, and advice. I just don't, because I am also struggling to find comfort and also answers, along with a resolution. Try to hang in there, at least for some more time. We should at least attempt to stick things out, and see where life is going in the next year.</p>

        <p>They were leaked by the Canadian Military. They’re not fake and CCP troops are currently stationed on Canadian soil. They’ve been occupying us since 2016. Don’t kid yourself. If the Canadian government gets the chance they will roll this agenda out. So please everyone. Stop complying. Stop supporting this medical tyranny. And don’t think for one moment they won’t seize complete control because that’s the ultimate goal. This is a fake pandemic to get us conditioned and get us weakened. If we stand up now it won’t come to pass. It only happens if we let it. China does not appeal to me so I will be fighting this till it’s either done or I’m dead. But I will not be accepting a dictatorship nor will I be taking the vaxx.</p>

        <p>They could be fake, but there's lots of hints in other sources of what may come, such as the (yes, actually official) governments releasing promotional videos for health passports, the media and "experts" clamoring for vaccine mandates, and all that.

        <p>I feel this. I started to have a bit of hope with the vaccine rollouts (I work in healthcare and there was so much excitement about it and the thought that it would get us back to normal). But now it’s a new year, and I just walked my dog outside without a mask (as I always do because it’s common sense). Everyone else who I saw outside was masked and I just got upset and hopeless again. One person had their mask hanging around their chin and promptly pulled it up and distanced themselves from me as we walked by one another. For some reason, it was hurtful. It all sucks. Just know you’re not alone in your feelings and please hang in there and find a good support system.</p>

        <p>You're missing the point with the masks.</p>
<p>The very fact that they aren't a big deal means that they are actually a HUGE DEAL.</p>
<p>They're designed to get us to accept compliance. To turn us into human sheep. To turn us into people who snitch on their neighbors. The woke busybodies snitch on us for not wearing masks first. Then they'll move on to snitching on where we're hiding under the floorboards when the Thought Police start the extermination phase: <a href="https://holocaustatlas.com/the-holocaust-the-second-world-war/the-stages-of-genocide-the-holocaust/">https://holocaustatlas.com/the-holocaust-the-second-world-war/the-stages-of-genocide-the-holocaust/</a></p>

        <p>Man, I spend a lot of time on here because this shit fascinates me. It consumes every instance of our day, this. You go out to the store - a reminder. Want to meet up with friends? A reminder. Going out on a walk? Reminder. Literally any news website / social media pages - Constant reminder.</p>
<p>The world feels like a deeply hollow shell of its former self. I feel exactly what you're feeling.</p>
<p>It seems as though the only thing you can really do at this point is move to a more civilized / sane place. Everyone in my area wears masks outside when they walk. They're freaks. All of the restaurants are closed so you can't meet up with buddies on a 40 degree night and just sit inside like you used to. All of their parents are some how "high risk" and won't allow anyone over. Then again, everyone is high risk. I suppose that's all about the "Victim Olympics". You don't get attention saying you're healthy. </p>
<p>I don't know how much more of this I can take. After this election FINALLY settles - I am moving. This is a real life nightmare. You're living in it, totally dystopian freakshow where no one even stops to question why their lives have been ruined.</p>
<p>What worries me the worst is the percentiles of normal, rational people in the USA. Each day the number of people who aren't buying into this shit seems smaller and smaller. Maybe it's just my area.</p>

        <p>Same man. I'm sick of the government blaming everyone for their mistakes causing people to blame each other, because they failed to enforce rules in march and get it over with. And everyone acting as if you're some sort of murderer walking around because you might have a virus on you, that you apparently don't know you have even though you know you're healthy deep down. This is unhealthy thinking. It's destroying us. All this fear of each other is tearing us apart. If we carry on thinking that we're going to die every single minute of the day then we may aswell just kill ourselves because that's how insane everyone sounds at the moment.</p>
