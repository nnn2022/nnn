    <strong>Losing faith in humanity</strong>
    <p><p>I’m so upset and disgusted with humanity right now. My family is going on a trip to another state, having a reunion staying with relatives in a couple weeks. I was so excited to go, until today, my mom told me I can’t come because I’m not vaccinated (the entire family is except me) and I’m gonna get them sick and “kill my 80 year old grandma”. I said what was the point of them even getting the vaccine if they’re still worried about getting covid afterwards. Obviously not a good vaccine then? </p>
<p>I’m not going to get into the ethical issue of me possibly infecting them because you guys on this sub know that that’s all BS. And obviously I should be more worried about me possibly getting sick from them since the vaccine has so many horrible side effects. She started ranting to me about how I’m so stupid for “not caring about science” and calling me a trump supporter (note: I’m a liberal, non-white female), etc.. How is it even possible to reason with people who are this ignorant? 
Now I’m currently in a huge fight with my mom and told her I don’t mind not seeing her stupid relatives again because I’d rather have it be that way then get the vaccine. Which is honestly true. </p>
<p>I’m just so upset and can’t stop crying. Obviously I’m not getting the vaccine and don’t want to go on the trip either... but is this the way things are going to be now?</p></p>

        <p>And this kind of thing is <em>exactly</em> what the powers-that-be want. Families divided and turned against one another, because they're easier to control that way. They're terrified of facing a united front on any level, because they know they can't win in that scenario.</p>
<p>So their only route to victory is subversion, division, and agitation.</p>

        <p>Ugh I am so sorry and I feel for you! My dad (60+ very fit) had covid (he said it was the flu for him) so I told him not to get it. He asked a doc he knows who said natural immunity is best. My stepmom got the shot and was trying to scare me into it saying people my age are dying, variants etc. My mom is the worst, once I brought up the ‘15 days to slow the spread’ campaign just to point out how long ago and quaint that seems now, and she said she never heard of that and accused me of having watched Fox News!?! She also thinks my husband is a conservative (he’s not) and asked in a very mean judgmental tone WHY he hasn’t got his and also tried to tell me people his age are dying and that he has a bad immune system. I will be in your position soon. I know what it’s going to be like. It’s unfair and crazy. If they don’t respect your decision they don’t respect you, they only care about the confines of their trash ideology.</p>

<p><em>Good.</em> My generation is such limp-wrists, gen X and boomers died riding dirtbikes, doing cocaine, fucking strangers, having fun. They threw TVs out hotel windows, drove hammered, shot guns at abandoned cars. My generation is so safe a chest cold scares them into compliance with clearly hyperbolic measures. They played with fucking lawn darts, for chrissakes.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry they’re putting you through this. You don’t deserve it. It’s YOUR choice what goes into your body. Not theirs. If they can’t respect your decisions that don’t even affect them (regardless of their paranoia), then they don’t really respect you. All you can do is put your foot down and walk away/end the conversation about the situation. Maybe they’ll wise up and realize they shouldn’t have treated you like this, and maybe they won’t. But that’s on them. They’re the ones being unreasonable.</p>

        <p>2, 5, 10 months from now they will be begging for your forgiveness. If they're really as unhealthy as you say, the vax is known to wipe out people's immune systems and they will be desperate for real truth. Whoever survives it will be, and we will be the strong ones. I'm personally working on myself right now, and trying to learn how to forgive these people for being so ignorant and so terrible to the point of shunning their own family, because later on if we don't give our love, if we all just say "told you so, asshole!" then a lot of them will commit suicide. The way you feel right now, it will be a thousand times worse for them because not only their health, but their entire reality model is set to collapse, very soon. They don't deserve to die. They are in for an extremely rude awakening, so I would only suggest, try to forgive them and in the meantime we're all here to show each other love.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry you are being put through this, it's not on you it's totally on them. I know that doesn't help you feel better right now but please stay strong, you have done absolutely nothing wrong. It sucks to find out that your family is so terrified they would choose their safety over their relationship with you. I can tell you this though, I've been spending a lot of time with my ex-boyfriend lately, his mom really likes me and enjoys spending time with me. Last week I was over at his place which is a brownstone where he lives on one floor and his grandmother lives on the other. I have been close to his grandmother for years, she's been like a grandma to me since my grandma's both died before I was born. We've been so close over the years and I spent this entire year visiting her not wearing a mask. Now all of a sudden I am forbidden from seeing her because I'm not vaccinated. They have this stupid rule where if you are not vaccinated you can't see her. It is cruel and inhumane, she's 91 years old and has Alzheimer's and she lives for social interaction. She's been asking for me a lot, my ex tells her I can't visit her because I'm not vaccinated. She gets very upset and cries. We do a lot of video calls and I send her homemade cookies and I cook for her.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the funny part. His mom was visiting there at the same time as me last weekend, she was spending the entire weekend with her mom to keep an eye on her. She gets extremely bored up there and she always invites me and her son to come up and have dinner with her and watch movies. Well neither one of us are vaccinated and we are not getting vaccinated. She told us all you have to do is put on a mask! We were both like no we're not going to be doing that, it's been over a year now and we haven't worn a mask in months and we're not going to start doing this again and makes absolutely no sense. Do you know this woman decided to come downstairs and sit with us for dinner and to socialize? She regretted her decision but there was no way for her to backtrack on it at that point so she made it as if she was just doing this for her mom. But she realized when we refused to follow orders that we were serious and she was the one that was going to be losing out on social contact. I think a lot of people that are doing this are going to realize how foolish and insane they are being when the people they shun say fuck it, I'm not going to get an injection so I can have lunch with you. They are going to go to a grocery store or a public place loaded with strangers, some of whom are not vaccinated but they're not going to see their own flesh and blood? They are obviously not thinking this through at this point. That's said , I would absolutely never be able to forget this and I think I would feel like I can't rely on people who do this, I can't trust them and I now know how they would react if I really needed them. They would choose their own comfort and safety over there love for me. Trying to find some solid people who will be there for you need be. These people have been successfully programmed and brainwashed. They can't think clearly at all.</p>

        <p>I know what it's like to be the black sheep of the family although in my case it's for different reasons. I also weigh about the same except I don't do pilates lol.</p>
<p>Ultimately it's better to cut yourself off from toxic family. It'll be lonely at timew but well worth it. I feel funny about the strong push for people to take the vaccine even though it's a new technology that was not present in other vaccines. There's no telling what ugly side effects are down the road but a lot of what was considered a medical miracle in the past ended up harming a lot of people. I.e. Radium, lobotomies and Thalidomide come to mind.</p>

        <p>Have people forgotten that you can still catch and spread covid if you are vaccinated? Tell them that and see how they react.</p>
<p>Infact tell them about Seychelles which has a massive influx of vaccinated covid positive patients.</p>
<p>The vaccine has been confirmed to do one thing (by the powers that be, God Man Fauci, 6 MBUH) and one thing only, to protect YOURSELF from the worst symptoms. I hate how people have completely forgotten about this.</p>

        <p>I am sorry this is happening to you.</p>
<p>Do be aware that no matter what happens to you good or bad, you are not the only one in the entirety of the world that it has happened to so you are never alone.</p>
<p>Perhaps one day they will relent on their decision.</p>

        <p>I know someone who got the jab. To sus their attitude I offhandedly mentioned "I don't know why anybody is worried about me not getting it, they've been vaccinated. They can't transmit it."</p>
<p>They said "well they can still get it and be asymptomatic and spread it."</p>
<p>It took a lot to not scream "then what's the point???!"</p>

        <p>How could your family do that to you!? That royally pisses me off. I'm sorry, friend. The fact your own family calls you names or labels you is disheartening. My family would never do that to me, they would respect my decision and move on.</p>
