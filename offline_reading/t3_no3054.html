    <strong>If this was man made they wouldn't want to kill obedient people with the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Basically think about it, if it was man made and has variants that are worse pop up eventually the variants could make the virus much worse than what we currently think it is. So far we are seeing that mRNA vaccines protect against all variants, essentially it would seem if there is some kind of conspiracy behind all of this then the virus would kill off disobiedant people who won't get vaccinated in the future especially since most here think the virus is nothing but like I stated in the title they would want to save people who are obidiant for this future draconian society. What do you guys think regarding this?</p>
<p>I believe the virus came from a lab, logically the alternative doesn't make sense but hopefully everything else I wrote isn't true.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT: If the virus variants become worse like they supposedly are, if it was maliciously created in a lab then it could be programmed to get worse and easier to spread which we are seeing by the current variants.... non vaccinated people could die while vaccinated people will be protected, what would you do if you know this and don't want to get vaccinated? </p></p>

        <p>I don't think they're trying to kill people with the "vaccine". I think they just don't care if they harm people as long as they're making money.</p>
<p>I also think it's about control and bringing back segregation.</p>

        <p>I think it was collusion between China and democrats to win an election.</p>
<p>And now itâ€™s collusion with democrats and big pharma to make a bunch of money.</p>

        <p>Culling is really, really hard. I don't think it's a eugenics program, but if it were, having the surviving bodies give themselves funerals and cleanup the mess would be awfully convenient.</p>

        <p>There's what blind faith looks like.... They DGAF!!!!! They make $$$ on every shot (9 new billionaires already) They make $$$$ on every bad reaction (no liability!) They make money on every test, on every treatment &amp; every death. they are already saying is shots will need boosters &amp; they make money on that too. </p>
<p>What they do NOT make money on is healthy people refusing the 'Fauci ouchie'. ZERO profit! Can't tolerate that. </p>
<p>Go get another jab &amp; say it's for me. You take my shot in Russian roulette. (You already bought the bullet)</p>

        <p>Funny thing about the "variants"- it is targeting the jabbed more! Now 'they' say a 3rd booster is needed. </p>
<p>Sure, something must be done. Got any suggestions? I'm not getting 1, 2, 3 or 'to infinity &amp; beyond' experiments in me. I didn't when there were trials promising thousands of dollars, I sure as fuck ain't for a beer, a donut or a lottery ticket!</p>

        <p>I never said to get vaccinated, but I do think people should move away from society if this ends up being a thing as you can't risk catching future variants.</p>
