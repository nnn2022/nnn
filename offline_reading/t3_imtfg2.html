        <p>If you’re having sex with a stranger it goes without saying that you’re accepting the nonzero risk of spread of a disease, and in a world of STDs, COVID is pretty irrelevant on that front. Just let people assess their own risk ffs. </p>
<p>I expect insane people like this to liken wearing a mask during sex to wearing a condom during sex.... absolutely mental</p>

        <p>i remember when i was a teenager, it was always CONDOMS CONDOMS CONDOMS because everyone was terrified of HIV/AIDS, which was still a death sentence at the time. sex ed in the late 1990s/early 2000s was pretty terrible, but they still stressed the use of condoms as a way to prevent unexpected pregnancies and transmission of STD/STIs.</p>
<p>i've heard that a lot of young people today are way more lax about using condoms, and aren't as vigilant as we were. is that because sex ed is now abstinence-only, or because now that we have ways to treat and manage HIV/AIDS, people aren't as scared of unprotected sex?</p>
<p>which is to say, i'm afraid that in the future, there might be legitimate reasons to wear a mask in certain situations (e.g. the ICU of a hospital, in nursing homes, etc) and people will blow them off and say, "who cares, what's the big deal, lol?" the way some people are blowing off condoms now.</p>
<p>i'm not in public health, i'm just the product of public high school sex ed circa 2000, and i still say, "if you have sex without a condom, you will get pregnant or you will get AIDS, and you'll die," and i'm pretty sure that's not healthy or accurate, but damn if it didn't stick with me.</p>

        <p>Lol the "expert" who suggested this is obviously still a virgin. These people literally don't know anything about anything. How did they get their jobs? How are they experts? Who the hell hired these morons?</p>
