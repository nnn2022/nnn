    <strong>2021 is scarier than 2020. Unpopular Opinion</strong>
    <p><p>At least in 2020 all we had to deal with (at the time) were the masks + lockdowns, so as much as that was annoying, at least the masks could be taken off, etc, and they didn't yet have the experimental jabs yet, and January/February/Early March 2020 were still fairly normal. </p>
<p>I'm very thankful my 2020 was still awesome (because I found you guys and its because in Texas, the scaremongering wasn't as much, and restrictions weren't too bad).</p>
<p>2021 however is a bunch of unknowns.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We don't know what will happen by flu season to the vaccinated (hopefully nothing bad happens)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncertainty regarding countries that seem to be putting MORE restrictions despite vaccine rates increasing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vaccines were only out for 6 months (start of distribution was December 2020 i think?), so its not even late enough to tell what could happen 5 to 6 months from now, but think back to March/April 2021, and compare that now to May/June 2021 where the myocarditis reports have gone WAY up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that they have their vaccines out, they have even more ways to coerce people unethically to take this EXPERIMENTAL vaccine against their will (by threatening to deny services to unvaccinated, etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Covid cult is growing even more compared to 2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Censorship is even worse in 2021 than in 2020, any question regarding the vaccine  and you're met with ad hominem insults over and over, and you're risking your health for the experimental vaccine without ANY guarantee the restrictions (in your area) will lift, since they can always shift the goalposts again with a new variant. Although for this, your mileage will vary (like I'm in Texas so this part isn't as bad)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whatever things the elites secretly achieved behind the scenes in 2020 while the public were distracted with the covid scare, we wont know until its too late in 2021 or subsequent years, which leads into 2030's Great Reset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stage is set. Lockdowns were introduced, now they've set a precedent in plenty of authoritarian countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least in 2020, as annoying as the masks were, you could just take it off. Not so much in 2021, where if you get the vaccine and you regret it, there's no undo button. You're fucked, and all you can hope for is that the vaccines are not as bad as the conspiracy theorists are worried about. Also, want to sue the companies? Oops, they're protected from liability, and they pretty much will just tell you to go fuck yourself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm worried about the time that we might say in 2023 or 2024, something along the lines of:</p>
<p><em>"2020 was the good old days".</em></p>
<p>That would be scarier than any horror movie will ever be.</p></p>

<p>&rt;<strong>Children should not be vaccinated for the moment.</strong><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;There is not yet enough evidence on the use of vaccines against COVID-19 in children to make recommendations for children to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Children and adolescents tend to have milder disease compared to adults. However, children should continue to have the recommended childhood vaccines.</p>

        <p>I think 2021 is worse too. Now they want to destroy your mind and body with their poison. Bad enough they destroyed our lives with allowing Covid to spread [whatever real virus was released beyond the phony PCR tests]. People are being separated over this stuff. I think the Christians got it right, it's full Revelation/Tribulation era time. I expect famine and war next. The hubris of mad scientists and sociopathic elite is combining to destroy humanity.</p>

        <p>in 2010 i started getting into stuff like meditation and lucid dreaming. I had this super intense dream that was basically my life in 2017, 2018, and 2019 (i had a crazy challenging few years)  at the end of the dream I went into this cave and EVERYONE i had ever known was standing in this cave staring at a sword coming out of a rock (think reverse sword and the stone) and I walked up the the sword and cut myself on it on purpose and because of that I "proved who I was". I woke up and felt like the dream was older than I was... ancient somehow and it felt more important than anything else... like some sort of ancient myth.   </p>
<p>If i hadn't had that dream (and many other dreams since then that have been fulfilled) I think I'd be sweating a lot more than I am now. I'm more or less relaxed right now, but that's only because I'm in a state of surrender. It hits me bad a few times an hour or so though.</p>

        <p>The only thing that I can say is genuinely better now is that we are all 100% certain of how much bullshit this all was from the very beginning. That feeling is freeing, especially when you know millions of people have also not bought into it.</p>
<p>Other than that, I actually look back on the early days of the hysteria and lockdowns with fondness. "I'm sure this will be over with in a month, two tops!" "Oh well, this will be a good opportunity to catch up on some video games!" Back then there was still at least a chance that this wasn't a major disruption of our lives. It wasn't yet certain that this was an event completely fabricated and planned for decades in advance by a globalist elite. Back then we had a different kind of hope I don't think we can ever get back.</p>
