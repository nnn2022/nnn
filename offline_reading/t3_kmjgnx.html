    <strong>DAE's perception of time got affected and having a hard time grasping this is real life?</strong>
    <p><p>I think the "new normal" with restrictions and lockdown feels like forever. When I'm looking on old TV-shows, movies, photos from my family album and such, I feel it's a very long time ago. Everything that's the true normal feel kinda old and ancient, in a way. It's moving to see people looking and acting normally in these pictures. I feel like 2020 has lasted at least 3 years although it's just one. Some pro-lockdown predicts the "new normal" would last 3 years in total because of it takes time to get everyone vaccinated and other have no clear goalpost. If 1 year feel like 3 years, then 3 years can easily feel like 9.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wake up and have difficulty understanding how this is real life. Everything are so absurd and feels wrong. I didn't expect such big changes happen and the whole world changing overnight just because of a virus with 99,9% survival chance. Old life feels real, but something from a very long time ago. "New normal" feels real and unreal at the same time. It's a different reality. I don't get it how we got to this point. I've no idea how to explain my feeling better either.</p>
<p>I also feel like a foreigner in my own country and that I don't belong anywhere. In addition I'm culturally differently from the majority and it's like we're living in two different worlds. Being as connected to people nowadays as before isn't easy. I elaborate further in three other posts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/kbfly3/does_anyone_else_not_feel_at_home_anywhere/">HERE</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jsdp4o/rant_does_anyone_feel_like_a_foreigner_in_their/">HERE</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/klwgoe/tired_of_feeling_like_a_foreigner_in_my_own/">HERE</a>.</p></p>

        <p>Won't lie, I'm in tears reading this and your other posts ðŸ˜­</p>
<p>What breaks me is how this will effect children, especially those just old enough to remember how things were in February but will now be brought up in a world where they are taught to mistrust <em>everyone</em> as being a potential biohazard bundle of disease to be kept away from at all times...</p>
<p>I think the phrase 'don't know what you've got 'til it's gone' is pretty apt right now...just can't believe so many are so prepared to throw away <em>everything</em> they should cherish for a virus with a 99.8% recovery rate ðŸ˜”</p>

        <p>I've fortunately never taken a day for granted in pre-pandemic times. I've for a long time known I lived in a democracy with freedom speech, had good economy, gender equality and that we scored high on human right the last decades. I felt sorry for people in middle eastern countries were someone else decided how they could dress, what they could and couldn't do. I didn't want this bs in my country and had discussions about it with friends of me. When fashion mandates, and recreational activities, school and business closed I was mad. What my country has been criticizing for years are suddenly a reality for us. It's authoritarianism.</p>

<p>Isn't it amazing? I was reading an old diary before. This time last year I went for a walk, sat down at a cafe, and had a cup of coffee. I never could imagine that something so mundane would be verboten just a few months later. And everyone around me is just fine with it.</p>
<p>And yeah, those children are going to be fucked up. We're raising a whole generation of neurotics.</p>

        <p>I feel so bad for the kids. Especially the ones who are old enough to remember how things used to be and are now being treated like murderers simply for breathing. My 11 year old step-daughter has been in virtual school since March and schools will continue to be virtual for the foreseeable future in my state. She should be enjoying her first year of middle school but that is shot to hell now. </p>
<p>My daughter will be 2 tomorrow. God willing, she will never remember this time. I've tried to keep her life as normal as possible. I even wear my mandated muzzle so that I can take her to gymnastics just for some normalcy in her life (she does not have to wear one and she never will).</p>

        <p>I'm 20 and I'm glad I never experienced this in my earlier days when I had a lot of other issues to go through. I had the normal teenage problems, I had mental side effects from international adoption (got adopted when I was a baby) and some personal stuffs. I had a failed suicide attempt when I was 14 y/o, which is my only one. But had ups and downs through my teenage years. I've been cured from most things, but my ASD is still here.</p>
<p>Although life had it's ups and downs, I was happy with a lot of things I had too. I lived in a free country, didn't have any economically problems and all that. I'm glad I didn't experience it when I was a child. It's traumatic enough now. Because of I'm stable and took some good life decisions, I've not felt depressed, anxious or suicidal. I'm not happy with the situation though.</p>
<p>I've mentally been severed from my ex community and feel like a foreigner. Good intentions doesn't help. I still don't feel at home in my country. Nice you wants to save some lives, but it's not changing that restrictions and lockdown are awful, or that I feel alienated.</p>

        <p>I feel like this all of the time. I constantly forget about covid, and it feels unreal when I'm reminded. It's real life cognitive dissonance. I simply can not wrap my head around reality, so my mind hangs on to the old reality. I'm surprisingly calm about it all too. I had my freak out over this from Mar to May. I feel nothing now to protect my sanity.</p>

        <p>Really? Iâ€™m jealous because this year has flown by. Watching my children have both their 1st and 3rd birthdays, now my oldest is about to be 4 and she still canâ€™t go to the zoo. Canâ€™t go to the childrenâ€™s museum. She remembers going last year and misses it. Iâ€™ve realized my littlest has lost out on half her life and her life is only beginning, and my eldest has lost 1/3 of hers. Theyâ€™re not in preschool or daycare but there are already issues. My children deserve socialization by typical means via playground, school, etc. this fucking shit has got to stop.</p>

        <p>I'm 20 y/o. Because of I'm in college age, I didn't have to experience the same challenges children, teenagers and parents have to deal with. I'm glad I don't have these problems.</p>
<p>The reason this year lasts "forever" to me is probably because of when you're bored, times goes slower than if you've a lot of fun. I still feel like a year of my mortal life gets taken away because of the restrictions.</p>

        <p>Yes, I feel much the same way. I feel in March I was plucked out of reality and placed in this pseudo reality where all that matters is COVID-19. Sometimes I think about something that happened in say, december of 2019 and I think that happened a few months ago.</p>

        <p>Maybe that's the difference between you and me. In my head, I feel like almost nothing has happened since march. For me time feels like it's going fast, and at the same time like it's stopped. The new reality doesn't feel real at all to me.</p>

        <p>To me the timeline went like this.</p>
<p><strong>January - May (1st year):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I studied art history. I enjoyed learning about art, the short term friendship I had and studying, but at the same time I wanted to study something differently because of it still didn't felt right to continue. Art is fun, but it was too much theory and I wanted to do something practical.</li>
<li>I travelled to NYC as a vacation and came home 1st March. The vacation was enjoyable although it wasn't my favorite city. NYC was normal in that sense it had no COVID19 restrictions and lockdown, but the mass poverty, dirty streets and shoeless/sockless people wasn't normal to me. I'm used to see wealthier people as a privileged myself.</li>
<li>In February I learned about COVID19 and thought everyone were overreacting. I thought it was clickbait and media wanting to sell.</li>
<li>In March when my country lockdown, I supported it the first few months (March-May) because of I didn't know the mortality rate, symptoms and limited data. In addition the daily exposure to media's fearmongering, comparing it to the 1918 flu. If it was Ebola, 1918 flu or the plague - I would understand some restrictions for a while.</li>
<li>The full lockdown ended in May. My university was still closed. It was closed from March till August. It reopen in September, but closed again. Since I changed university, I didn't face the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>June - August (2nd year):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In June, July and August I learned new recipes, took pictures, was on a road trip and helped my granny cleaning her house - giving it a little makeover.</li>
<li>Except the travelling restrictions for international travelling, summer was pretty much normal. I went to an amusement park. There were no restrictions other than sanitize your hands and keep one meter distance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>September - December (3rd year):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In September people's mindset went from "we're all standing in this together" to "you're killing granny". People became hostile, judgmental and society cared less about the poor, disabled and everyone else than pre-september.</li>
<li>I become a real lockdown skeptic, not a fence sitter, in August because of mental health, the economy, education and rights. I've read about it and I was fed up.</li>
<li>Schools have been closed and reopen several times. I started studying sign language, something I'm very happy for.</li>
<li>Draconian restrictions like mask mandate, 2 meters distance instead of 1, recreational activities closing, max 5 guests and so on started. People are much more afraid at this point than they were in March.</li>
<li>Came in an argument with schools where I was "Karen" by society's standards and called it out for being unfair, when it got a mandatory mask policy. My complaint was about I couldn't lipread co students and when they didn't sign, I was excluded and that I couldn't keep up with the lectures. In the end they bought clear masks to everyone, so now I can attempt lipreading.</li>
<li>I feel disconnected to almost everyone and everything. I don't feel like this is a temporarily emergency situation anymore. The virus has high survival rate and mild symptoms for most people. I start feeling like a foreigner. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hardofhearing/comments/klwgoe/tired_of_feeling_like_a_foreigner_in_my_own/">Something I elaborate in this post</a>.</li>
<li>In December I had a painful Christmas shopping full of restrictions and unhelpful shop employees. But I had four nice Christmas days where everything was normal. My family met and acted normally. Even pro-lockdown did. After Christmas, everyone lives in fear again.</li>
<li>Everyone talking about waiting for a vaccine and we can go back to normal again in the end of 2021 or 2022.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, much has happen in my life although it has been a lot of boredom in periods.</p>

        <p>I feel like this all the time. I watch old TV shows, look at old pictures and just sit and think about the way life used to be. I'm jealous of the way things used to be - moving freely, no masks, no social distancing. You could just...walk on a plane without a mask, go into a store without a mask, plan a vacation without worrying about restrictions. I sometimes can't believe that this is the way life is.</p>
