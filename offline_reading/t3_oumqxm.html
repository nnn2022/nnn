<title>Flu vaks began in the 1930s. 90 years later, flu vaks is still only 10-39% effective and requires yearly dose. But XOVID vaks is 94% effective after less than 1 year in development! Mmmmk...</title>

    <p><p>And "only requires two doses to eliminate it completely!"</p>
<p>Correction... Pfizer vaxx efficacy down to 84% after 6 months of public experimentation (article from yesterday):</p>
<p>https://www.statnews.com/2021/07/28/efficacy-of-pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine-slips-to-84-after-six-months-data-show/</p>
<p>Maybe by the end of the year, it will be down to 10% lol. </p>
<p>But considering they can't even test vaksed people for XOVID, and they actively reject reports from the public, they're clearly pulling these numbers out of their ass anyway.</p></p>

        <p>The only way the COVID vaccines could possibly be anywhere close to as effective as claimed is if the vaccines  really were developed over the course of at least a decade.........</p>
<p>By people who knew how to kill COVID, precisely because they were developing COVID at the exact same time they were developing the vaccines.</p>

        <p>Those numbers are why basically everyone I know who worked in medical research refused. We all know that numbers can be gamed easily enough, and there's no way in hell those numbers are accurate. </p>
<p>I didn't need anything past that "94 % efficacy" thing to know that the studies were complete BS.</p>

        <p>&rt;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/21/obituaries/rene-dubos-scientist-and-writer-dead.html">“Rene Dubos, the microbiologist</a> formerly with the Rockefeller Institute, succinctly summed up the historical record. <strong>”The tide of infectious and nutritional diseases was rapidly receding when the laboratory scientist moved into action at the end of the past century,"</strong> Dubos wrote in Mirage of Health. "In reality," he observed, <strong>”the monstrous specter of infection had become but an enfeebled shadow of its former self by the time serums, vaccines, and drugs became available to combat microbes.</strong>” ^1:220</p>
<p>&rt;”Professor <strong>Dubos has further stated:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Modern Science’s role in defeating infectious diseases has been greatly exaggerated.</strong> Many of the most terrifying leprosy, plague, typhus, - had all but <strong>disappeared</strong> from Europe <strong>before serums, vaccines, and drugs</strong> were developed to combat them". ^2</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“Many so-called "medical discoveries",</strong> however, have been <strong>announced by the Rockefeller Institute.</strong> Among them have been the supposed "discoveries" of the organisms that cause infantile paralysis, smallpox, mumps, measles and yellow fever; and the "discovery" of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever.  <strong>All of these "discoveries" announced by the Institute have proved false.</strong> But most of them have served definite and <strong>profitable purposes</strong> and have been <strong>exploited commercially</strong> and intensively.” ^3</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>"Harry Nelson, Medical Editor for L.A. Times, reported</strong> on an American Cancer Society Seminar for Science Writers, and announced that <strong>microbiologists have uncovered new findings that incriminate vaccination.</strong> One of the participants was <strong>Dr. Robert M. Simpson of Rutgers University, N.J.,</strong> who stressed that <strong>‘Immunization programs against flu, measles, mumps, and polio may actually be seeding humans with RNA to form proviruses which will then become latent cells throughout the body</strong> ...Some of these could be molecules in search of a disease, which under proper conditions become activated and <strong>cause a variety of diseases</strong> including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, Parkinson’s disease <strong>and perhaps cancer."</strong> This quote is from the Honorof Report for June, 1976.” ^4</p>
<p>&rt;##“DOCTOR FORESEES A NATION OF INVALIDS</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Dr. S. S. Goldwater, New York Commissioner of Hospitals</strong> pointed out in The Modern Hospital Magazine that the <strong>present measures used</strong> to check contagious diseases <strong>may permit of longer life — but not of stronger life. As a result of the drugs, vaccines and other suppressive treatments</strong> used to check diseases, <strong>he says that, "chronic diseases are growing at such a rate</strong> that America may become a nation of invalids. <strong>Over half the hospital beds are filled with chronic sufferers, both old and young."</strong> (from Health Practitioner’s Journal, June, 1944)” ^5</p>

        <p>He's not wrong, but the implication is not what he thinks. It's been in process for decades, but never approved. In other words, this is a good argument for being cautious here, not for saying "Oh yeah, this thing we've been working on for decades but could never make work is totally going to work now!"</p>

<p>Given they've never been approved despite work dating back decades, it seems likely to me that there's some biological reason why mRNA technology doesn't work. I have no idea what it is, but the simplest explanation for why this keeps failing is that there's some reason that the technology doesn't work quite right.</p>
