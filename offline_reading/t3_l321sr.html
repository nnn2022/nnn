    <strong>TIFU by telling my friends my gf thinks she has covid</strong>
    <p><p>We were supposed to go to a cabin for the weekend three high school friends and the wives/gf’s. My gf has a typical cold but lost her taste. Said to friends this morning she has a cold and thinks it’s covid, I ask what the thoughts are and leave it open. One of the mothers is relatively unhealthy and isn’t doing so well, but they fly off the handle and throw a shit fit. I’m like that’s why I asked and they just let me have it... again.. that’s why I asked.. I will pay for our part I’m not gonna stuff you on the bill.. they ask why she won’t get tested. I say my gf doesn’t want to be a part of the BS statistics. She lost her sense of taste so what’s the point? It’ll be positive anyway, and add to the “scary” numbers if the test is accurate to begin with! So my friends wife whose mother is sick says sorry for being part of the BS statistics because I care for my mother... like... I’m nit trying to imply they’re ALL false, but look at the facts... I didn’t even counter it, didn’t have the energy to fight today.</p>
<p>Sorry for the formatting.. Mobile and it’s been a long week.</p></p>
