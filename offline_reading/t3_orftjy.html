    <strong>"Following the Science" documentary</strong>
    <p><p>Apologies if this has been posted before. I feel it's a good presentation of all the WRONG things that have been done up until the vax was released.</p>
<p>The most striking thing, in my opinion, was the explanation that the PCR test is entirely inaccurate and, if the PCR test was taken away, basically there would be no pandemic!</p>
<p>" Everyone from clergy to politicians have repeatedly said we must "follow the science". But have lockdowns, social distancing, masking, testing, and vaccination actually been following the science? In this powerful documentary, you'll hear renowned scientists explain how the path we're on may not be "following the science" at all... "</p>
