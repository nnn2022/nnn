        <p>I feel like it's not just the school system, despite it being a contributing factor. People just do not give a fuck about educating themselves.</p>
<p>I still remember middle and high school. Nobody, except "nerds" like me, would pay attention to lessons. I'd see many of my peers doing their homework right before class, and copying off each other.  </p>
<p>I had an excellent history teacher in high school. He was a former Army vet, and he would try to teach us to be free-thinkers. He told us not to buy into propaganda, to do research on political candidates, and so on. But my classmates would not give a single fuck about listening to the man or giving him respect. For the record, he never raised his voice to anyone or did any of the bullshit other teachers did. </p>
<p>My point is that people are so fucking lazy and ignorant. I wish people wouldn't be, but I think this is a huge part of why we're in the situation we're in.</p>

        <p>People are generally unhealthy and have little free time too, you work a shitty job and come home and it's easier to turn on some propaganda on netflix than read a book. </p>
<p>I think you were lucky to have a good teacher like that, a lot of them suck and do more to destroy a child's natural curiosity with blind obedience and repetition. </p>
<p>It definitely takes more effort to research something for yourself than just watch tv and do what they say. A lot of people have been trained to be obedient to authority from a young age too so when "experts" and the authorities tell you what to do you obey, they don't even trust themselves to make right decisions, put no faith in their own ability to reason.</p>

        <p>I'm not really sure, but I think part of it might be placing less value on social acceptance? A lot of people just go along with the status quo because of social pressures. If you're already "odd" and rejected in some ways cause you're a nerd or something as you say, then might as well follow your passion? Most people are afraid to hold opinions that are not approved of in their social circles, and they value fitting in a lot.</p>

        <p>Your experience almost exactly mirrors mine. I had a history teacher and a poli sci teacher that were like yours. I still remember their names and their ability to make ideas and critical thinking interesting.</p>
<p>It must have been soul-destroying to come into class every day and realize that 80% of the students looking at you with their bovine, dead eyes couldn't care less about what you were saying.</p>
<p>My contempt for most of humanity was planted very early - in school.</p>

<p>School was hell for me. Though the problem was they did care about what I would say because then they'd use it as ammunition to bully and torment me with. Having to do presentations in class was just torture for me because there'd always be that one asshole who'd shoot a spitball at me or shout some rude insult at me or whatever, and the rest of them would holler at this. </p>
<p>Also, yes, my contempt for most of humanity started with school, then my family then through other experiences.</p>

        <p>Something that I will never forget is helping our teacher grade tests over World War II in American History our Junior year. </p>
<p>One of the questions on the paper was a multiple choice question asking who were American allies during World War II. The choices were Britain, Germany, Japan and Italy. And there were people that went with Germany or Japan. </p>
<p>We spent weeks hell maybe a month on the subject and even watched several movies including Saving Private Ryan. </p>
<p>How the hell after that much classwork can you think that the Japanese and Germans were our allies? I would have thought that most people would know that anyways just from pop culture.</p>
