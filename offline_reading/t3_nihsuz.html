    <strong>This pandemic has made me realize we are nothing but numbers</strong>
    <p><p>You know there was a time where I thought we were all different. From having our own beliefs, personality, etc. However, This pandemic has really made society look well kind of stale. Everyone following whatever is put out infront of them, everyone doing trends on tik tok, everyone digging up people's past and blasting it on social media, being just numbers in covid cases whether you were positive or negative, whether you died from covid or recovered, we ended up being numbers.  </p>
<p>All what people care about is the numbers. The number of people wearing a mask. The number of people who died from Covid. The number of people who got vaccinated. The number of people who aren't. It's really depressing when you think about it. See nobody seems to care about the actual individual. Do these people who only look at one side of their story ever question anything? Like why someone is flipping out for not wearing a mask "after" someone started recording them? How many times that person was told they couldn't enter a building without one? How many times they were insulted for not wearing a mask? Yet they claim it's the people wearing a mask getting all the hate.  </p>
<p>You could be going through cancer, obesity, abuse, alcohol abuse, mental health, but the ONLY thing people are caring about is Covid19. Yeah that person who you berated to put a mask on or kicked out of your store is going through social anxiety, but you didn't know that and assumed they didn't have any mental issues huh? That person you berated to put a mask on or kicked out of the store just left their home to escape their abusive spouse. That person you berated to put a mask on or kicked out of the store just lost their job because their business couldn't follow the Covid guidelines. If people ever stopped and think of what other people have gone through before they opened their mouth to order people what to do there wouldn't be so many issues.   </p>
<p>Nope all what people care about is getting the numbers down. Not caring what someone has gone through. Not caring if someone has another condition, but wants to write off their injures or death due to Covid reasons. It's ironic the way people are treating others thinking they are doing their part to keep someone alive is just causing them more grief. Yet it doesn't matter if people are hurting anymore. As long as they are alive and can't spread germs right?  </p>
<p>Yet we are the bad guys...</p></p>

<p>There's been swaths of dehumanizing. Hiding our faces. Hiding in statistical sampling. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=anti+lockdown+protest&amp;t=brave&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Blackouts</a>. But its the self-censorship and manufactured consent that hurts me the most.</p>
