    <strong>I'm scared for my daughters future</strong>
    <p><p>Just today I was listening to some idiot on youtube explaining how we can't go back to normal once we got rid of corona because we have to prepare for the next pandemic. We'll have to keep our distance forever and wear masks forever. </p>
<p>And the dutch government is discussing ways to reward all the people who will get the vaccination. By letting them travel, letting them shop in a mall, go to a concert or visit an amusement park (we don't know yet) </p>
<p>Meanwhile the Netherlands is turning into an extreme left shithole. I always considered myself to be left, but this is just bizarre. Everyone who isn't a vegan nonbinary lesbian hipster who supports blm is just a racist bigot who wants to kills grandmas. 
Coming from someone who used to be vegan and is part of the lgbt community.     </p>
<p>Is this the world I'm leaving for my daughter?
I don't feel home in my country anymore and I don't recognise my fellow humans anymore. The fuck is happening?</p></p>

        <p>Yes it is many because PCR can't distinguish accurately, right? PCR Can't detect the source of detected virus particles, etc.

        <p>We all feel this, I think. I’m sorry and I can understand your heartache. I have three sons and I fear they will never find a true relationship and feel love other than from their father and I and that’s not gonna cut it into manhood. 😢 I have cried many nights over what’s happening. </p>
<p>I’m in the states and also can relate to not feeling at home, I am so disappointed in my fellow country men. </p>

        <p>I don't even visit those subreddits and I don't watch the media cause it just depresses me. I try to avoid it by all costs. When I'm outside with my daughter, riding our bikes, rollerskating, walking our dog in the woods, the world seems normal and I have a bit of hope for the future but then I turn on the computer or I talk to other people and I can't figure out where we went wrong.</p>
<p>I always thought having a son instead of a daughter would mean less worries, but apparently not :( 
How old are they? My daughter is 10</p>

        <p>Same here, my neighbors across the way, thank God, have not fallen victim to this and they have four kids. Two boys a little younger than my youngest son so they get to play together like kids should. My older two boys I worry the most for, they really have no one to physically be with their own age. They have some friends on video games but I fear for the impact of the world too. My boys are 14, 12, and 9. </p>
<p>They used to be able to go do extra curricular things like spend time with others kids at the library and even that has been shut down. My two youngest were in cub scouts and that’s gone too. We homeschool because schools have lost their minds. My husband was on a homeschool fb page and someone had asked where can we take the kids where they don’t have to wear masks, and the community attacked her and they removed her post claiming she was inciting illegal activity! </p>
<p>This has to stop or we may all have to live outside this madness in our own small communities.</p>

        <p>Lucky enough my daughter can still play with other kids too. We live in a neighbourhood with lots of kids and the government told us everyone below the age of 13 doesn't have to wear a mask because children don't give each other corona (they did lock down the schools though, because kids can't give each other corona, but they can when in school????) </p>
<p>Homeschooling is illegal in the Netherlands but I wouldn't homeschool my daughter anyway because she loves going to school with her friends and if she's hapoy then I'm happy as well. </p>
<p>We did look into small communities years ago (me and my now ex husband) but I don't think I could handle that. I love the anonimity of the city as someone who's autistic. But I get the appeal in these weird times</p>
<p>&rt;they removed her post claiming she was inciting illegal activity! </p>
<p>That's beyond fucked up</p>

        <p>Ya kids over two have to wear masks here, completely insane. Unfortunately, my older two boys had a really rough school life. Dad was Army(recently retired) so they had to move a lot. I was young and fell into the schools  trap of he’s too this and too that and he needs medication for add and blah blah so we went through a lot of heartache and behavior issues. So my older two hated school. They did like being around other kids and gym class but that’s about it, so we have had to do home learning for a while now. We tried public k-12 but even they lost their minds over this last year. I don’t align with or agree anymore with what the teach my children. So this year has taught me school(other than being a social gathering) is useless. </p>
<p>We have actually learned a lot more and I get to learn with them. There’s more discussions and I think they will retain more. Plus they can have a meltdown here and I don’t have to go pick them up and their learning disrupted. Here they don’t get what they want until the do they work. I am still upset that all the extras they could do before and be around kids are just poof, gone. </p>
<p>That’s nuts homeschooling is illegal there. But I understand what you mean about not wanting too, it’s hard sometimes. Also, I miss the break to myself during the day. There’s talk here they want to start checking in on who’s homeschooling here. Law in my state says parents have a natural right to choose how to school their kids and state can’t intrude on that. Also, honestly seeing the people pushing this lockdown shit(lots of teachers) and realizing they are all so educated makes you wonder what’s really being taught. Almost like they bought and didn’t earn their “degrees”. </p>
<p>The Netherlands are beautiful by the way. I’ve been. We used to live in Mons Belgium. Actually my first two boys were born there. My husband was stationed there, was a great experience. We had a friend stationed in the Netherlands. We would go visit him and the houses were so cool, three stories and really pretty and colorful.</p>

        <p>Exactly how I feel! Masking children is child abuse. Especially making them feel if they don’t have one on that they are killing people. They are effectively psychologically fucking up an entire generation. Ya at first they said kids I’m kinder didn’t have to wear them then they pushed to mask them too and even though they didn’t make it a mandate right away most parents or kids would be shamed to wear them. That is only in the schools that even went back to session. Where I am schools still not gone back anyways. Over 50% of kids are now failing at least one subject and attendance to online is very low.</p>

You are definitely right for gome schooling your kids in that case. I would too. Imagine letting children feel  quilty for not wearing a mask and thinking you're doing a good thing. These people are dellusional.</p>

        <p>I find it really surprising that people are so scared of getting sick by an airborne virus that isn't all that lethal, yet they the majority of westerners put poison in their bodies daily via alcohol, drugs, pharms and processed food.  Like, what exactly is causing all this fear?  I am partially concerned while also super proud of myself for not having this "issue"</p>

        <p>I'm Dutch myself, what the hell are you on about? This is not at all how the general atmosphere is. I myself am fairly left, LGBT as well, and I don't see any part of these things in most of my social circles, which includes people who are more extreme in their views than I am. You have to be seeing things from a loud minority. Ways to 'reward' the people would completely make sense, as you would then be safe from the virus, thus making it possible for you to go to places that would be health hazards because of the corona virus. And of course, the idea that this will forever be normal, is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
