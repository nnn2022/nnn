        <p>Yeah, That is nonsense.  There are countless doctors on LinkedIn commenting on trying to figure out why deaths fell so much.  Some say vaccines, but others saying vaccines statistically don’t explain it.  Some think we got better at treating Covid patients...</p>

        <p>How about the fact that virus mutations tend to get less lethal but more transmissible? I remember reading about that way before there was an issue with variants. The article I read said  this would happen so it’s not exactly a surprise.</p>

        <p>They don't talk about deaths anymore in the US. It's all about cases, which is and has been a ridiculous metric and one that can easily be abused on an ongoing basis for at least several more months.</p>

        <p>Cases are peaking again not deaths </p>
<p>Deaths lag, with that said I suspect deaths will not be as high as prior but I don’t know how we can say it’s not from the vaccine </p>
<p>Infact of deaths do peak again it’s probably gonna be the best anti-vaccine argument there would be</p>

        <p>&rt; Deaths lag,</p>
<p>The Cases peaked July 17. 18 days ago. The "death peak" two weeks out from that either happened already, or is happening now. Delta seems to be a real nothing-burger.</p>

        <p>Deaths have gotten higher each wave </p>
<p>2nd wave had more then the first, 3rd wave had more then the 3rd. Then the vaccine drops and death rates decline </p>
<p>This goes for the US btw </p>
<p>As for the UK, it is a norther area aka cold weather aka people stay inside during winter months and go outside more often. </p>
<p>This is why you are seeing more cases in the American south right now, it’s hot and people are staying inside </p>
<p>Flare up and death rates seem to correlate with indoor activities </p>
<p>Which is a good argument for being against lockdowns especially lockdowns that aren’t strict enough</p>
<p>Btw I’m not for lockdowns so we atleast agree on something lmfao</p>
<p>I do not know the lock down scheduling of the UK but my understanding is they are relatively lax compared to the EU and also subsequently has had some of the worst numbers</p>

<p>The death rate declines because they use a different standard of testing those people, or they don't test them at all.</p>
<p>If you cannot see the data manipulation, no one can help you. Sorry.</p>
<p>Europe and the northern parts of the USA following the same patterns to the letter - a classic Gompertz curve. </p>
<p>Southern parts of the USA followed the Latin-American behaviour of the virus, which is different with a smaller and longer-drawn out scenario. That's why the USA has the appearance of more waves, when it was in fact different regions affected at different times.</p>

        <p>I’m pretty sure what you said in your last two paragraphs I said in my last message so I’m not sure what your point is, but I agree cold weather climates have peaked in the winter, warm weather climates have peaks in summer, when people go inside the virus spreads better </p>
<p>I can say the numbers from Florida are pretty convincing to show the vaccines works, I’m not sure what data you have to say the data is manipulated </p>
<p>You can claim manipulation but a claim is just a claim, Id happily read some data or research to prove it </p>
<p>What you can’t manipulated is what I see </p>
<p>Regardless of the testing, I’m seeing a similar disease pathology that is packing my hospitals to capacity, granted a few hospitals In Florida does not represent  the world as a whole but I know what I’m seeing is real and those that are sick now are unvaccinated this is coming strait from the patients mouths</p>

        <p>India had the delta variant hit while their vaccine rates were very low and that’s when India suffered its highest death rates </p>
<p>The UK had delta come through with a reasonably high vaccination rate and death rates are some of the lowest they had </p>
<p>So we have two large populations with the same variant one with the vaccines one without </p>
<p>And the test group with the vaccine had lower death rates </p>

        <p>In my opinion deaths are a much better indicator of an effective response against an endemic virus. Covid isn't going away.</p>
<p>Pfizer is researching a "designer" version of ivermectin as we speak. Of course, they'll say it's more effective... But to me that's the smoking gun that ivermectin works, research on it is censored, and big pharma has no qualms about killing people (or at least, letting them die) for profit.</p>

        <p>The issue I take with "following the science" is that science has become super centralized - if you want funding for research, that funding is almost certainly coming from a pharma company. Or from a university that takes pharma funding. Google, Wikipedia, and the government move in tandem to suppress science that goes against the narrative.</p>

        <p>I think vaccine concerns are further out than a few months though.</p>
<p>Didn't even the previous attempts at creating coronavirus vaccines that led to eventual ADE, give some tangible protection for a few months? I'm sure they had protection for 3-6 months then when challenged with a coronavirus after that period, they became much more ill.</p>
<p>Also, at least in the UK I think we're still only at what 50% vaccinated or so, so it's not really a large enough group to say the lowering of deaths is due to the vaccine, as it's clear the unvaccinated are also dying less frequently too.</p>
<p>SARS also fizzled out on it's own accord after a few waves and that was much more lethal than SARS-Cov-2.</p>

        <p>The UK is closer to 70% vaccinated and 80% with atleast with 1 dose</p>
<p>Now I think you may have saw a 10% jump during the last wave from panic but is theorize that when you see how fast the UKs cases dropped off they maybe that last push plus those with natural immunity finally pushed the UK to herd immunity </p>
<p>Infact with soon to be 80% vaccinated and wave infected as many as you did if the UK has another surge this winter you may have an good argument that herd immunity is not gonna happen, but if this is the last wave of the UK maybe I have a point </p>
<p>SARS and MERS are more deadly but not as contagious, I will happily admit this 2 year cycle and out for the virus may very well be true, but I don’t think we just let it rage though us for two years if we think we can safely decrease the deaths by a vaccine </p>
<p>You want a real conspiracy why the fuck was there no vaccine made after SARS?  Dare I say the powers that be turned a blind eye knowing damn well that one day a variant would come through that was contagious to infect the globe? And dare I say they may have stirred up mistrust and doubt in the people so a large enough portion of the population would avoid vaccination then
Use that mistrust as a reason for a power grab? Dare I say your natural instinct of skepticism is being used against you?</p>
<p>Call me crazy lol</p>
<p>Also because sars is less contagious it is well with the realm of possibility that it fizzled out cause it was easier walled off. Not only that but deadlier viruses are usually easier to pick up as a doctor</p>
<p>If 10 people show up to my hospital with pneumonia I may not think anything of it, if 10 people show up coughing up blood and their hair Falling out I’d immediately think something was up</p>

        <p>And as the ADE it’s a legit concern, but it’s something that def could of been vetted prior to being sent to the public, like you said 3-6 months.  The vaccine was in Trial for I want to say 9 months before release and going on 15 month now We would be seeing this by now </p>
<p>We should be seeing the vaccinated getting sicker and the vaccinated should be getting the virus more often and they are not </p>
<p>I will acknowledge that from a timing standpoint you may need to wait another 6 months to know for sure but if that’s the case at the very least there are labs and instituted covering this ADE stuff in the smaller setting labs that have been doing this from the start</p>

        <p>I don’t deny vaccine side effects </p>
<p>Never have never will</p>
<p>Mainstream media may claim none, even though I’ve never seen such a claim</p>
<p>What I will say is the side effects are over blown, a lot of what’s posted online is falsified and of the legit cases they do not compare to the side effects the virus carry</p>
<p>I think we both would agree if we could choose 500k dead from the virus but no one dies of a vaccine or 100k die from a vaccine but no one dies from the virus, that we both would choose the 100k dead by simple may </p>
<p>There are 650k + dead in the US</p>
<p>There are 12k self reported adverse events from the vaccine</p>

        <p>650k dead, and if you read the CDC website (I've linked it a few times, you can search my post history) it states that only 5% had no co-morbidities and died FROM covid, while everyone else had at least 4 other issues and died WITH covid.</p>
<p>When you use an inaccurate test as your primary means of "diagnosis" when it was never intended for that, and then include people who "died within 28 days of a [false] positive test", you are lying to yourself if you think this isn't going to skew the numbers significantly in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>This is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts, by the mainstream.</p>
<p>Incentives are a thing for covid patients. Don't believe me? My parents neighbor in a third world country got covid and ended up in the hospital. When he came home, he told my parents that he was assaulted by the medical workers twice, where they tried to kill him because the government pays them for every covid death.</p>
<p>It's so incredibly unbelievable I even had an argument with my parents about it. But this is not an isolated case.</p>
<p>A lot of things posted online are falsified bullshit. It's when the doctors I work with started singing the SAME tune that I realized there was more going on. Entire staff of physicians refusing the vaccine here in London. I know of 3 people who died within 1-21 days of getting their second vaccine.</p>
<p>You can certainly convince me of fuckery online. But you cannot alter the reality of what I have heard and seen from people I know in real life.</p>
<p>I can only hope that all these experts claiming of the potential for long-term complications from the vaccines are wrong, for your sake, because I have zero plans to ever take a single one of these shots.</p>

        <p>Just cause this disease effects unhealthy people does that mean we should just say fuck it and let them die?</p>
<p>Absolutely not. Death rates are low in south Saharan Africa compared to most nations with much much much better medicine </p>
<p>Why ? That population is young and rarely obese </p>
<p>Age and obesity are primarily the reason people die, if your under 40 and in good shape with no other underlying issues then yes this virus will not kill you, likely it will be no more then a few days of a fever and a bad cough </p>
<p>I don’t discredit your personal experience and you can discredit mine</p>
<p>I’ve seen multiple young healthy pregnant women die from this as well as their unborn children, I see my patient population being ravished right now </p>
<p>Does the vaccine cause side effects and even death? Sure. But the virus is worse </p>
<p>Are the deaths from the virus skewed numbers? Sure, they are</p>
<p>Is profit a motive? Yes, but any basic understanding of how health care makes money would let you know sick patients make money not dead ones. Maybe there are some 3rd world countries that get international aid based on deaths but in the states that’s not the cases </p>
<p>The hospitals get paid a allotted sum for a covid patient, mortality rates lead to less money here in the states, we are incentivized to keep deaths rates low, complication rates low and length of stay low </p>
<p>Even if 90% of all covid deaths are false </p>
<p>Which is an aggressive number,  but even if it is there still are more reported deaths from the virus then the vaccine </p>
<p>And this is something I’ve seen myself </p>
<p>I make no claims that my lived experience represents the world, but there are very few people who have seen this disease first hand as much as me</p>
<p>It’s hospitalists, ER staff and ICU staff that know what’s going on </p>
<p>And the majority of them will agree with me</p>
<p>Also longer term side effects of the virus exists, if we are gonna hedge are bets against the vaccines side effects down the road then we need to acknowledge the  virus will likely lead to chronic lung disease cardiomyopathy and the list goes on</p>

        <p>UK is heavily vaccinated </p>
<p>70% fully vaccinated 80% with atleast one dose</p>
<p>Because a large portion of the population is vaccinated your gonna see a lot of break through cases.  And those cases fair  very well and almost know of them die </p>
<p>Secondly the majority of the unvaccinated in covid are young they also rarely die, by vaccinating the elderly you eliminate the majority of the deaths </p>
<p>And lastly the delta variant may very well be less deadly, we don’t know this yet but I make no claims about it’s mortality in either direction</p>

        <p>I’ve never claimed these vaccines were perfect, I’ve never claimed these vaccines won’t require a booster, I’ve never claimed there would not be break through cases </p>
<p>I get that a lot of people especially those who are blindly pro vaccine may have may those claims,  but those of use that understand the virus and the vaccine are not shocked </p>
<p>I’ll be honest they are less effective then I would of liked, Especially to their longevity </p>
<p>I think we need to be rolling out titer testing and finally get to the bottom of who does and doesn’t have immuntiny and how long it lasts </p>
<p>As far as I know the delta strain was the not the dominant stain in the UK till this last go around from what I know it was the alpha stain back in the winter wave </p>
<p>I’m not from the UK I will happily admit I’m wrong if I’m wrong, cause I do not know for sure when the delta strain became the dominant strain</p>

<p>The vaccine efficacy in Israel is now 16%. FFS, who is going to be taking vaccines once or twice a year, since they clearly don't maintain efficacy?</p>
<p>The Delta variant was sequenced in the UK in December, it has been here since then. It only recently (1-2 months) became dominant here, and even then, deaths have been very low from it. Feb 2nd to June 22nd 2021, 117 deaths from Delta.</p>

        <p>One vaccine In Israel is showing that efficacy </p>
<p>There are plenty of others to make claims that one poor vaccine represents them all is unscientific </p>
<p>Also boosters were never out of the equations, I’ve never made claim we wouldn’t need them</p>
<p>We use annual booster for the flu shot, hepatitis B and MMR can also loose their titers and need a booster </p>
<p>We also don’t know how long the booster will last, we have vaccine that require a booster and last years </p>
<p>So to make ant over arching claims from the Israel numbers isn’t fair </p>
<p>I admit those number are not good and I admit we may not be able to reach her immunity </p>
<p>I’m not making any absolute claims,  but if we can reach herd immunity we need to try and there is data out there that says we may infact reach her immunity </p>
<p>The UK is at 80%, with this wave and what I assume will be boosters in the elderly soon will be a very good test, if they don’t have a winter wave it’s a good signs</p>
