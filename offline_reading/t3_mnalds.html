        <p>And the highest IQ of them all, is the Elite who have played this game so perfectly, and made everyone submit to their nonsense. It just shows, most of the world is retarted and these are the same people who will follow their Fauci fk doll, if he was to say "Jump of a cliff to prevent covid!" They all will run to the cliff to jump first and will have a competition who falls to the ground faster.</p>
<p>These people are the clowns playing in the circus, which the elite are laughing at while watching the whole show.</p>

        <p>This has less to do with IQ and more to do with wisdom. </p>
<p>People put a lot of stock into IQ, but it is true that IQ is only a small portion of intelligence.  Intelligence is so diverse and multidimensional.  There are parts that are hard to record and quantify such as emotional intelligence, wisdom, wit, and cunning.</p>
<p>For example, a person can be normal intelligence, and have enough wisdom to compare previous trends from history to today, particularly if they look at who the phariahs are in society. </p>
<p>A person might also be relatively dumb and have gotten screwed over by the government and also realized it.  That person might be less trusting.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A high IQ person might be relatively anti-social and not want to return to regular society, or that person might believe every official number that they are told to believe because that high IQ person might value honesty and integrity and project that honesty and integrity onto the media and the official narratives.  The high IQ masker/vaxxer might think to himself "if I were in a position of power, I would want what is best for the overall health of the nation, therefore, it is safe to assume the government, the vaccine manufacturerers, and the media are trustworthy." and the high IQ person might never look into the information or dig deeper because he could easily have other things to do with his time and energy.  We can't research 100% of all things that we might be skeptical of.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Anybody can also believe the lie "taxes are what we pay to live in a free society".  That sounds like a pretty reasonable thing to believe on the surface, and a lot of high IQ people believe it.  There is also an underlying fear in the prospect of defunding police, or less military funding, because in a primitive city-state, or a small village, fewer spears means less defense against raiders. That fear is still with us today, despite how much more complicated it is.</p>
<p>The best thing that anyone can do is to remain calm and not get swept up in the fear or anger.  It gets to the point where people are turning on the TV and looking for the next thing to get afraid of or angry at.  The <strong>fear is a stick</strong>, and the <strong>anger is a carrot.  Fear of the virus</strong> has people <strong>panicking</strong> and not knowing how to react.  Then the <strong>news, other internet people, and other scared people</strong> want to feel better, so they <strong>attack people</strong> not wearing masks.</p>

        <p>I’m in the very dull and very bright spectrums. Depends on the people. If I bring up the fact that this virus is relatively harmless and a vaccine mandate would be very strange and the people agree then that’s the end of the story. When they go on to say that I’m part of the problem and that people like me need to be dealt with, that’s when I start talking about how I’m not gunna feed into the hive mind consciousness because i did it before and it got me nothing but trouble so why would I do it again when the same hive mind consciousness is attempting to make the masses choose security over freedom. It’s a very slippery slope for the rest of humanity who still have a chance. </p>
<p>Falling in line simply makes it easier for the hive mind consciousness to engulf this reality. That’s part of the problem of this reality, it was a prison for this mess, it’s the opposite of a conglomeration, instead of one human tuning into multiple consciousness this fucker has decided that it should be the only consciousness in existence and is attempting to break in anywhere it possibly can. The brain is a radio that tunes into the consciousness frequency, if this hive mind can tune the brains of enough individuals it’s only a matter of time until that hive mind has usurped the vessels of many consciousness. </p>
<p>At that point, well I’m hoping before that point so that the souls may still be saved, but regardless, that is when the hive mind will be left to rot in this reality for all of eternity, good luck creating more vessels, you may have to escape into virtual reality in all honesty, so have fun in this lost reality hive mind. If you make it entertaining we may just leave you be in the long run.</p>

        <p>I wonder what it's like to be a midwit. Does the hivemind network enable a midwit to see through other midwits' eyes and so forth? Like they have a huge megasoul that's basically controlled by well, an elite.</p>

        <p>Basically how it works is the hive mind fractures and implants itself into the brain of the individual in question. If the brain is a radio that tunes into the consciousness frequency all one would have to do is alter the foods ingested, manipulate the media being consumed and make sure those one associates with are already partaking of the hive mind. Then the body would naturally tune itself to the consciousness frequency desired and boom fracture implanted. The main consciousness of the hive mind can perceive the perspective of all its fractures but the fractures themselves cannot perceive the perceptions of the larger consciousness.</p>
<p>It’s sort of like how the initial version of this reality used a hive mind, but the current hive mind attempting to usurp this reality is merely a fragment of that initial hive mind. So everyone is already a part of that initial hive mind consciousness frequency that birthed this world, which is fair, but now a fracture itself is attempting to take the places of all other fractures. So instead of the consciousness to human ratio being 1:1 it’s now sort of gotten out of hand where now the hive mind consciousness has taken over a majority of the people that use social media. I won’t say the world because that’s not fair, I know it’s more 50/50 if anything.</p>

        <p>My view 18-30- if you are in good health and not overweight, don’t take vaccine the likelihood you die from it is 0.
30-40- if you are in great shape don’t take it. Otherwise maybe take it.
50-80- I would take it, any long term health effects will barely matter.</p>
<p>If you are a fat slob- go to the gym.</p>

        <p>Just do your own due diligence on all the pharma companies who made vaccine. History of corruption, bribery, knowingly putting carcinogens into products and many more. </p>
<p>Trusting "dream team" of politicians and pharma corporations knowing how much they lie is pretty fucking stupid. One side will never waste a good crisis to gain more power and other will never skip on $. </p>
<p>I will just wait on the sides and not take the jab, maybe when it gets out of early alpha access. I can deal with "Israel" issues where non vaccinated have to eat at the outdoor tables.</p>

        <p>What, pray tell (and I'm genuinely curious about this one), do people think the vaccine is for if it's not for COVID? I see all over this sub about how the vaccine doesn't work and this and that and the government is pushing it anyways. But nobody ever seems to elaborate on why the government would push an ineffective vaccine, at least not beyond generic shadowy government doing shadowy government things which must surely be bad because of reasons.</p>

        <p>I am, actually. Doesn't really much matter if I actually get an answer or not but I find the general thought processes of this sub to be somewhat fascinating. I'd love to see exactly what people think the government is doing with this vaccine business, at least provided it's not muh mind control or muh chip implants, those theories are old news and pretty silly.</p>

        <p>My reddit time is near done for the day, and I doubt your honesty, but, no one here is mind readers, so there are multple hypothesis on the subject.  I'll put out a few.  These can and most likely are combined to some extent.  The best things have multiple benefits.  I'm also including, masking, social distancing, lockdowns and vaccine passports, because isolating the vaccine while ignoring the rest is silly.</p>
<p>1 - Least conspirital in nature.  Profit, profit, profit.  Big Pharma gets big profit for this fiasco.  </p>
<p>2 - People are more stressed, get less sunlight, are less active and becoming more unhealthy.  We're destroying our immune system and becoming more dependant on Big Pharma for basic survival.  This makes us far easier to control in the future.</p>
<p>3 - Depopulation, it's no hidden secret a lot if influential people are of the opinion we need to reduce our population significantly.  A vaccine that causes issue down the road or further hinders our already dwingling ability to reproduce would help with this, and the best part is, by the time the vaccine starts killing people or people start having fertility issues, one or the other, or both, plausible deniability will be in effect, not that it matters with their liability protections.</p>
<p>4 - It creates a scenario that allows for government overreach and a power grab.  The government rarely gives back power it's acquired, and this is a perfect storm of opportunities for government overreach.  </p>
<p>Etc, out of time.  My client needs my attention.  That being said, only some of the 4 of many need to be true, or any of the many other possible reasons.  If you can't think of any, regardless of whether any of this is true, I pity your lack of imagination.</p>
