    <strong>Real COVID deaths?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey so I’ve been hearing a lot about how the coronavirus deaths aren’t what people say they are, that it’s much lower. Can someone give me more information about that?</p>
<p>This is not an attack lol, I’m on your side!</p></p>

        <p>Don’t know off the top of my head. But I know that if people had cancer and covid and they died of cancer than it was reported as a covid death. I also don’t know for sure but I think that hospitals (maybe not in the US) would get compensation from the government for every covid death. I know for a fact that was the case in old folks homes where I’m from (QC,CAN). So obviously hospitals would want to try and take advantage of that.</p>

        <p>Will you please stop lying about this. The only time someone having cancer was listed as a CoVid-19 death was <strong>IF THE COVID-19 SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASED WHAT THE DOCTORS THOUGHT THEIR REMAINING LIFESPAN SHOULD BE!</strong></p>
<p>Like my father: Had a CAB and the CoVid-19 made the CAB fail by attacking it.</p>
<p>They <strong>rightly</strong> labeled his death as a CoVid-19 death! Because if the CAB (coronary artery bypass) had NOT been attacked by the CoVid-19, <strong>he would still be here right blipping now!</strong></p>

        <p>Yes, I do: I happen to be AGAINST the masks and lockdowns but this stupidity of saying "The deaths are Exaggerated!" is getting me roaring angry here.</p>
<p>They are not exaggerated. If anything, they are UNDERcounted because many people like my mother are not going to the hospital until the absolute last minute.</p>
<p>The only reason my mother's death was rightly counted as CoVid-19 caused? She had the nasal swab done and they tracked from that to her multi-organ failure.</p>
<p>No, she was not 'waiting for death'. She at 69 was HEALTHIER than I am right now.</p>

        <p>Well, I hate to say this, but I just tried to find the table on the CDC website where it lists causes of deaths in the US by whether the person died of something totally other than corona, with corona and other contributing conditions, or with corona only... It seems that the column that lists corona only, which recently had shown a count of around 9,000, is no more. </p>
<p>Maybe I’m just having a harder time finding it this time or maybe it is actually gone. Not sure. Maybe someone with better eyes than I can find that. </p>
<p>But things like this (from the CDC’s website): “COVID-19 deaths are identified using a new ICD–10 code. When COVID-19 is reported as a cause of death – or when it is listed as a “probable” or “presumed” cause — the death is coded as U07.1. This can include cases with or without laboratory confirmation” really give me pause and makes me question how they are counting this stuff.</p>

<p>The text I copy/ pasted in my comment is below the tables under a section called “Understanding the Data: Provisional Death Counts and COVID-19”. It’s almost at the bottom of the page, it’s the first big text block, kind of highlighted in blue, after the tables.</p>

        <p>The general consensus among people like us is that 9/10 people who have died had a comorbidity and were most likely on their way out of the door anyways. I.e. heart conditions, cancer, renal disease, liver disease, obesity, stroke, etc. </p>
<p>But because they happen to have Covid or been in contact they just issue Covid as the cause of death. I’m pretty sure there’s a story about a person who was shot and died as a result of the gunshot wound but they were asymptotic with Covid and they ruled it as a Covid death. </p>
<p>That’s typically what we mean. And I don’t speak for everyone on this sub since we’re all our own people but that’s usually what I mean.  </p>
<p>Since Covid has around a 99.999 for people under 70 and people 70+ are about a 99.997 survival rate I personally feel that it’s over hyped and governments are drastically over responding to this. </p>
<p>Only around maybe 10,000 Americans have died from strictly Covid. Perfectly healthy normal people. Which is VASTLY less than the 200,000+ they’re always screaming about. </p>
<p>Where as the lead cause of death heart disease kills around 655,000 Americans every single year but we’re not shutting all of America down over that fact or freaking out. </p>
<p>Again I don’t speak for everyone on this sub and I’m sure there’s differing opinions. But that’s how I view it.</p>

        <p>I thought you meant the upwards trend at the end of the graph.
Sure people died and probably some died of the c Virus, but people die all the time.
If the virus causes more deaths than usual can only be said for sure if you compare the annual deaths with the deaths of 2020 so far several countries have  a pretty average mortality.</p>

        <p>Sure but it only shows the graph for 6 months. Maybe it evens out in the rest of the year and the spiked only killed en Masse the people, that would have died anyway during this year.</p>

        <p>Referring to state’s policies of discharging nursing home residents from hospital care (when no longer in need or higher level care, but still infectious), leaving them nowhere to go but back to nursing home. No, I don’t save links to press conferences or articles, I’m just too lazy, but I’m sure someone here probably knows exactly which states did so when.</p>
<p>Note “intentionally” refers to the latter part as equally likely of incompetence or evil.</p>

        <p>No no, covid didnt just push them thats crazy talk. Covid that was transmitted to them in the air through a light breeze from approximately 17.36 miles away, caused side effects through a vortex air reaction, which mixed up the covid particles and caused it to mutate, which led to them having suicidal depression, which, im turn, led to them climbing up on top of the bridge, THEN pushed them.

        <p>The media is lying about covid deaths and making too many assumptions about supposed 'official' covid deaths.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Even official covid deaths are sometimes not covid deaths at all but the person died of something unrelated and was found to have covid close to death or after death. This is a real issue in my country. The news intentionally puts it between the lines to trick people, but it's there.</li>
<li>Most young people who died of covid had severely compromising conditions like cancer. The youngest person (46) to die by covid in my country supposedly had cancer but the media refuses to say it.</li>
<li>Even with patients who do look to have died of covid, there's no way of knowing if they had underlying conditions that not even doctors at the time knew about.</li>
<li>Issues with testing. There is a big debate going on about the validity of covid testing, if just having antibodies means you're infectious or have the virus. If someone just had antibodies and was not displaying symptoms of the virus how can you say that it killed them....? There is also the phenomenon of false positives and false negatives, where nobody really knows how to define a false result and nobody knows exactly what the error rate is.</li>
