    <strong>Let's stop calling the opposition "dumb"</strong>
    <p><p>Calling the ones who want the mandates and lockdown are anything but dumb. They know exactly what they want and what they're doing. Calling them dumb/stupid/idiot/sheep gives them an out or an excuse for their behaviors. All of this is so they can feel good about themselves and get that thumbs up from dear old government. It's about the likes and retweets. Social media has become a moral barometer for these people on what is right and wrong. That's why we ended up here. When your only information outlet comes from the same source and no difference in opinion is presented, of course people will start believing it. </p>
<p>This is why you see the proverbial "mental gymnastics". These are the same people who would boo a heel in WWE only to cheer them moments later when they do something favorable, "forgetting" all the crap they've done before that. By telling them the truth it's like cutting a drug addict off cold turkey from their daily fix. They need their endorphin high from those feel good likes. </p>
<p>They need this to feel important and loved because they don't get it elsewhere. A lot of these people weren't raised with the morals and values we have. They will never understand we are not the enemy because their brain is fed with toxic drivel daily. I take the time to read both sides of the fence. Let me tell you, they spout the same language about us we champion here about them.</p>
<p>They say things like:</p>
<p>Lost sheep
Non critical thinkers
Idiots
Uneducated</p>
<p>It's easy to think of yourself as the hero when you tell yourself the other side is the villain. They think the same way about us. Both sides need to realize we should not be at war with each other. The real enemy is our established system we let get out of control. We traded all of our freedoms years ago for the guise of safety. This is the final nail in the coffin. Stop promoting division because we're playing right into their hands. Right now we're witnessing the fall of an empire to let another step up in our place.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely. We need to find ways to come together on this- I’m tired of seeing everyone divide at the drop of a hat when there is a disagreement.</p>

        <p>I totally agree with you, my concern is the intense push by the media to blame unvaccinated people for every bad thing happening in the world right now. This push is increasing daily. They're going to have more lockdowns all over the world and they're going to blame unvaccinated people. It's going to be an intense psyop and do a number on a lot of people. CNN actually had a headline the other day that said vaccinated or infected. As if there are only two states a person can be in now. It is sick and destructive and it's destroying us.</p>

        <p>I felt this way early into the vaccine deployment. What scared me the most is when I’d see friends of mine who I thought would see through it, readily get the vaccine and shame others for not getting it. It’s crazy- it’s turning family members against each other too. </p>
<p>It’s really tough though, the moral implication. Media definitely uses that to their advantage. Media has always really been used to push a narrative- but I don’t remember so many people just accepting what they say and defending it.</p>

        <p>Excellent post, I totally agree. I have not called anyone a moron or an idiot or a sheep during this entire thing and there were plenty of times I felt like it but I know how it makes me feel and how it makes me shut down so I avoid doing it at all costs. I know that speaking at a person never gets through. And lots of people are unable to have a civil discussion now because they are too emotionally charged.</p>
<p>I have been looking at the media aspect of all of this and it is shocking to see the degree of manipulation and propaganda thrown at us from all sides. There is definitely a mainstream narrative as you can see by looking at any mainstream news source or even Googling something. I think millions and millions of people are going with what they've always known, they aren't questioning it. Why would they? It's always worked before. Nothing like this has ever happened so they have nothing to compare it to. I think this is why a lot of people from communist countries see through this and recognize what's happening. And I'm not even talking about the political aspect of all this I'm talking about the methods they are using in order to control people's minds.</p>
<p>It is work sifting through information and deciding what seems credible and what's not. Even being from this Viewpoint I see things all the time that I know you are likely not true. I'm not believing everything I hear even if it goes along with how I'm feeling. But for a lot of people, they are caught up in life, have families they're working at cetera they don't have time to sit down and sit through all these different information sources so they're just taking what that handful of sources is telling them.</p>
<p>Since 10:30 last night nearly 200 people have joined this board. The growth rate is steadily accelerating. That indicates people are at least curious and questioning.</p>

        <p>Well said. I think a part of it comes down to human nature as well.  The need to feel right and vindicated. Yo be safe in a crowd of like-minded people. There's a sense of security that human beings desire. 
Additionally, we can't forget how much media has done to divide this country. They've done a really good job at that. 
Not sure how we can ever reconcile.</p>
