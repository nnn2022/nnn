    <strong>People Always Ask What We Want before We Get the Shot. It All Boils Down to Transparency.</strong>
    <p><p>Recently we've had a ton of posts asking what it would take for us to get the shot. If you read through the comments, you will see a ton of different answers, but they all boil down to transparency. Transparency about the virus, about the public policy, about the treatments, about the "vaccines."</p>
<p>Why can't we get an official investigation into the origins of the virus? Why do we get the same "we recommend an investigation" articles we got a year ago, yet no official investigation has started?</p>
<p>Why can't we get official studies on mask and lockdown efficacy? Instead, we get masks "may" work at preventing at the spread but no concrete studies. No, CDC saying they work and false equivalence examples are not studies.</p>
<p>Why were the guidelines for listing COVID deaths so broad? How did the flu disappear when the symptoms are literally the same as COVID? Why are the tests run at such high cycles that they produce an unreasonably high amount of false-positives?</p>
<p>Why hasn't there been a public health push towards common sense practices (exercise, healthy eating) before we had "vaccines"? Why does the mention of any secondary negative effects of the lockdowns, like suicides, alcoholism, missed hospital appointments, get immediately shot down?</p>
<p>Why are any treatments (besides "vaccines") immediately buried? If a treatment shows any ability with no side effects (like Ivermectin and HCQ), why are they not at least used in some capacity (even on vaccinated people in the hospital)?</p>
<p>Why are the "vaccines" pushed as the only way out of this "pandemic"? Why can't we allow companies to have some liability for their products? Why can't we trust the VAERS database that has been trustworthy for decades?</p>
<p>Why can't people admit the vaccines don't stop or slow the spread of the virus, they suppress symptoms and may help with deaths? Why do we force kids to get a vaccine that doesn't stop or slow them from spreading something they won't die from anyway?</p>
<p>Why doesn't the CDC test vaccinated people (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html</a>), which would provide evidence the vaccines slow or stop spread? Why does Fauci brag about "unvaccinated are the majority in the hospital" knowing that they don't test vaccinated people?</p>
<p>If doomers, or the government, could answer just a few of these questions, this sub probably wouldn't exist at the level it does. Instead, they continue to gaslight and strawman us about each and every one of these issues, which will only drive more people to our side.</p></p>

        <p>I'll never take it. Not only because it's experimental and it's manufacturers are corrupt as shit, but I'm not at risk of dying from covid, so it's absolutely unnecessary for me. I don't make a habit of taking unnecessary medical interventions, I care about what goes in my body</p>

        <p>Exactly! Very well put.</p>
<p>Though it seems you were cut off or something in the second to last paragraph.</p>

        <p>Great points! The big thing you hit on for me is the fact that the vaccines aren’t stopping one from catching or transmitting the virus. It pretty much makes the idea of vaccine mandates absurd. It is driving me insane. Even all the very pro vaccine posters state that the “vaccines were never meant to stop you from catching it, they just prevent hospitalization and death” then in the same sentence they blame the unvaccinated for the spread of the virus. It’s like all logic is gone.</p>

        <p>You did a great many people a huge favor by writing down these questions in this calm, reasoned way. I, for one, am extremely grateful to you for doing this.</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>
