        <p>Welcome. Thank you for your open mind. Here is a recent article in BMJ describing the political corruption of the pandemic <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4425?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=hootsuite&amp;utm_content=sme&amp;utm_campaign=usage">https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4425?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=hootsuite&amp;utm_content=sme&amp;utm_campaign=usage</a></p>

        <p>Best way to do that is to become part OF the sub community, then you will get it. Many come here with post like yourself wanting answers from people here that only you can really answer yourself. We aren't rabid anti maskers that foam at the mouth in rants about Karens coming after us for not wearing masks. All of us here are well aware Covid 19 is a real threat. And that masks, if used correctly can keep one from catching covid - a virus, and also not. A catch 21.</p>
<p>But truth be told, there really is no <strong>new</strong> <strong>normal</strong>, only ever-present <em>change</em>. The better you become at navigating change as it happens, the more successful you will be in all your endeavors. In other words, work through the change of this Pandemic and be the better for it. Never try to ignore any change by simply trying to normalize it.  In other words, don't worry, be happy.  :)</p>

        <p>First, the tests are bunk. There are 2 tests being used and neither one can diagnose Covid. In fact neither one can tell a virus from a bacteria. </p>
<p>They are being used to give false positives and keep the fear going. (links in comment history since I'm on my phone in my car). </p>
<p>The symptoms for Covid are identicle to the symptoms for influenza. So everyone with the sniffles is going to be treated as if he or she has Covid.  Link is in my comment history or just Google them and the CDC. </p>
<p>The mortality rate per age bracket for the flu is higher than that for Covid. In other words, more can die from the flu.</p>
<p>Also, the only reason the death count was high in the beginning was because Democratic governors signed executive orders in their states that forced nursing homes to keep Covid patients instead of sending them to hospitals. They did that because it allowed the virus to spread and kill thousands of residents. This virus kills old people and that was the perfect place to inflate numbers. </p>
<p>According to the CDC, only 6% of reported Covid deaths are actually Covid deaths.  So that's like 14,000 and most of those were in nursing homes.</p>
