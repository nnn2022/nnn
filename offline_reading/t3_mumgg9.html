        <p>For me personally the virus itself is irrelevant. Even if it was as bad as they say it is, it doesn't detract from the fact that the world's leaders are clearly using this crisis to reforge the world into something else.</p>

        <p>the political leaders probably have no end goal - they simply entered or increased the never ending spiral of fear, greed and idiocy. politicians, especially the very leading ones, are incompetent slugs, with their main interest being re-elected no matter what</p>
<p>this is my take</p>
<p>are there politicians you sincerely trust with most or everything they say? if yes, is it because you have no other choice? if no, then why listen to them?</p>

        <p>Perfect excuse to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Implement sweeping economic and social changes in preparation for job losses and disruption caused by emerging technologies, AI/automation, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring about the "Internet of everything" where they finally bring in technologies for social control which hitherto have only been used for entertainment. This includes personal digital IDs for every person on earth,  something which were being touted by the UN and a company called ID2020 from 2016 onwards. This they said would be achieved (through Microsoft and Gates Foundation supported GAVI) by utilising vaccinations as a means of getting digital identification past scrutiny. Real world trials began in 2019 with the Bangladeshi government. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Accelerate" the UNs sustainable development goals, of which coincidentally, the UN had said 2020 would mark the start in a "decade of accelerated actions". Many of these goals like those to do with environment and poverty sound good on paper but it depends on how its implemented (and more importantly for whom its implemented.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possible implementation of Universal Basic Income using a Chinese style social credit system based on your behaviours, including your Internet history.</p>

        <p>Why would they destroy their economy (having to pay jobless losing economic value from them) and do you think they would really produce that much just to seek you and how expensive would that be and third they already track you with Google Facebook why would they need to chip you for extra money. And why there are no videos of chips produced?</p>

        <p><em>"Why would they destroy their economy."</em> </p>
<p>You just answered your own question. It's already their economy. It's been their's since the formation of Central banks, arguably since the 1600s with the creation of the Bank of England, definitely since the Federal Reserve and blatantly obvious since the New Deals of the 1930s. Its been a slow game, but basically the end result of "their" capitalism is no different to communism in that it leads to the collectivisation of assets. </p>
<p>They aren't paying you really, and to be honest the financial system as it stands now isnt much different, but the new digital currency system would basically amount to tokens which you exchange for basic necessities. There's a chance that in the wake of climate change actions they will argue they need to do this to regulate resources to keep a balance with the natural world. </p>
<p>In all fairness maybe the planet really is screwed and this is necessary but I'd rather our omniscient, loving overlords were more honest about their intentions. </p>
<p><em>"They already track you with Google Facebook why would they need to chip you for extra money."</em></p>
<p>Yes, Facebook, Google etc have been tracking us all for over a decade now so with the advent of AI they can probably predict our behaviours better than we can, which is dangerous and why this must be resisted 100%. Its potentially like saying "the Gestapo have been monitoring everything about you and your life for years, why are you scared of boarding their train."</p>
<p>More to the point though, they don't need chips, it'll be on your phone and accessed through QR codes and app interfaces. You've been reading to many MSM hit pieces on "antivaxxers" I'm afraid.</p>

        <p>China is the country that benefited the most from the virus. They reached zero COVID and fully reopened about a year ago (when US &amp; Canada have just closed).</p>
<p>Tedros Adnahom (head of WHO) worked as a minister of health in Etihopia, a Chinese ally then and now. Also, he actually liked to deny Cholera pandemics back in a day, when they happened while him being a minister.</p>
<p>So Tedros made a big effort to make sure the virus spreads worldwide, calling travel restrictions racist, he made a huge effort to rebrand the virus to obscure the fact that it was first spotted in China. Then he made a big effort to push the world into lockdown, once the virus spread. Then, when China reached COVID zero in two months (and Canada, who did everything WHO required, didn't reach covid zero to this day) he praised the CCP.</p>
<p>We can add to this the fact that many serious scientists (including former CDC director), and my scientist friends who I personally trust, are certain that  the virus is very unlikely to gain the ability of human transmission while never being observed in humans before. Looks like the virus knew right away how to spread in humans. This is an indirect evidence of an engineered virus. Add to this the fact that Wuhan is known for it's research. On the other hand, zero evidence of animal origin was found. They keep telling us that the origin 'does not matter', like it doesn't matter who has seen the murder victim the last. Hm. That's the only thing that matters, that's how 97% murders get solved. </p>
<p>So when the world started probing Wuhan virology stuff, in the US there was a wave of fight against 'anti-asian hate'. That's the same 'travel restrictions are racist', the easiest way to convince an american to do anything is to tell him that he will be racist if he doesn't do it. Virus is not engineered, because thinking so is racist. CCP is not race, but they want to make this accoiation, if you disagree with CCP, you hate asian people, even though CCP hates all kinds of asian people.</p>
<p>Also, add to this the fact that countries that suffered the most from COVID are enemies of China. Chinese allies in Africa had 150 times less deaths than the US, all while having almost no national healthcare. Russia &amp; Belarus, chinese allies, are fully open, including nightclubs.</p>
<p>All this points that the end goal is to make China the world superpower instead of the US. This is done with partial collaboration of the western elites. The elites in the west are very old, they want to cash out and retire, and selling their countries to China is the outcome that many of them see way more desirable than fighting for stupid sovereignty in this postnational global world.</p>

        <p>I don’t believe covid is fake but I believe anyone currently in power is trying as hard as they can to profit as much as they can from this. While most people have difficulty just finding a job in this economy the billionaires over tripled their wealth this year. I think the governments are hoping the people go into tribal me vs them mode after they finish pushing the narrative that every human on earth should get the vaccinations, because covid kills people and you’re “rejecting safety protocols” but vending machines also kill people and safety measures for those are not to shake the machine, well fuck you I want my bag of sun chips and freedom. they’ll just pivot to a new “issue” while retaining all their newfound power</p>

        <p>Everyone always try to profit but the pandemic is to most unprofitable. Countries (people aren't working you have to pay money for them bc they are jobless that demages economy by a lot. But some profit but in the long run without pandemic they would profit more ( having to buy equipment vax etc) and i think you should be vax if you are exposing in the job etc and i think you should be able to choose with vax to vaccinate.</p>

        <p>No single person in government gets negatively effected by their citizens not working or their economy crumbling, they’ll just go to the federal reserve and keep printing more money for that. The positions being abused in government is just about every position because all they have to do is allow someone more corrupt with a bigger bank account to take control of them and now you have elite high status types using the government as a vice to churn out whatever public notion or law they want passed, no one in these positions is making conscious decisions based on the betterment of humanity, and if they were I guarantee they’re now dead. Do you not see a flaw in this??</p>

        <p>It's not that deadly as ebola etc but deadlier with the new variants but still bit deadlier then flu. but what is worrying that it's so infectious and that it's very deadly to older people and to people with physical problems and i think it's not right to be careless bc it won't affect you and i don't care about others.</p>

<p>Also, how low do you think the infection fatality rate for covid should be for all restrictions to be lifted (no more lockdowns, masks, distancing, etc.)? Give me a number. 1%? 0.5%? 0.3%?</p>

        <p>So we do agree that they arbitrarily decided to change the definition of a medical term to better suit the end goal, everyone getting the vaccine. How can you still trust them as they change language around you? </p>
<p>According to the Norwegian public health department you are more likely to die from the Astrazenica vaccine than covid in most age groups. This isn't safe and they are literally changing language to gas light everyone.</p>

<p>Have you ever asked yourself why pro athletes are risking their lives everyday during a <strong>deadly global pandemic</strong> to provide us with entertainment? These are multimillionaires in top form....why would they ever expose themselves to a killer virus by being in constant close contact on the field or leaving their mansions at all? </p>

        <p>Can you explain why these guys insist on health hazards as a solution to a lifestyle? I don't know about you, but I know my body better than you, or any doctor or scientist or government official. Yet these guys insist on what is good for me. Let me give the facts about me.</p>
<ul>
<li>The mask you wear does not protect me</li>
<li>The drugs you take do not protect me</li>
<li>The distance you keep from me does not protect me</li>
<li>Locking me in my house does not protect me</li>
<li>Removing basic human rights (like to travel, see family etc) do not protect me either</li>
</ul>
<p>And since I know my body all of the aforementioned points are health hazards for me. Do you know what health hazards means? Maybe you live in hospice and you are drugged and you no longer realize how life works.</p>
<p>So isn't this whole thing a scamdemic or not?</p>

        <p>Doctors discovered what? That was known since the 19th century. Doctors advertised smoking and still do. Nothing has changed. Added opioids, various drugs enforced by the doctor. If you want to learn about health you don't do drugs and stay the hell away from them. That was the point and the proof is right there.</p>

        <p>I did prove it. You just don't like my proof. So you have evidence that I am lying? You don't. But I have evidence you are lying. Because you are accusing people of being sick the moment they aren't. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; And how do you think they started knowing </p>
<p>It takes few minutes at most, ever for a newborn to understand that their respiratory system is malfunctioning. How long do you think it takes to realize that you have difficulty breathing? That's why I am confident you are on drugs because you can't realize it, there is no common sense in what you say. That's why you think everyone around you is sick. </p>
<p>You are mentally ill, it seems</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;i don't agree woth your opinion that I'm drugged? </p>
<p>Not at all, you are all for drugs that's why you are drugged. You are the one who advocates "vaccines", right? Well I have news for you, vaccines are drugs, officially. That's not my opinion. So you are drugged and you advocate drugs. It's that simple. And anyone else along with you who promote this crappy government policy, mandating drugs is also sick without a doubt. As well as advocating other hazards. See here for masks for instance</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/whosthetard/comments/lsrvo7/impact_of_masks_in_physical_performance/">https://www.reddit.com/user/whosthetard/comments/lsrvo7/impact_of_masks_in_physical_performance/</a></p>
<p>But...don't just read the literature. Test it yourself. Unlike unknown drug substances (aka vaccines), cigarettes and masks, you can test them yourself, yeah? It's dead easy, to see that they detriment physical performance. Stress your body a bit and see. Which means they are not good for your health to be constantly used. Now you may need to use some types of them in some occasions, but not like this. These are not to be used as part of your lifestyle, it's stupid. </p>
<p>Now if you are wearing a mask you are sick for the environment you are in. You can't withstand the environment so you need something extra. It's like you walk with a walking stick. You can't walk because you are sick so you take an accessory, an aid in other words. Same goes with drugs. You take a drug because you're sick for the environment you're in. You never take health hazards to become...healthy. It's retarded. And every other person has nothing to do with your lifestyle choices. </p>
<p>I am not healthy because you are sick. I am healthy because I don't listen to those who advocate drugs and health hazards. And I test things myself so I know where I stand each moment of my life.</p>

        <p>Read above what hazards masks cause. Try one yourself and sprint. See how you perform with/without. </p>
<p>So you are lying. Because my post shows clearly that masks detriment physical performance. And cause damage to the environment.</p>
<p>So you are a liar and you spread misinformation</p>

        <p>And even the PCR test is another part of the scam to catch the public off guard. That long stick is coated with nanoparticles, and the public (including myself) were duped into assuming it was merely a long Q-tip.  Those nano particles go into the brain, and I must say I'm both outraged and emotionally numb to think what could happen to me at this point in life.  Why weren't we told everything about how the test is performed? And why is the cycle rate so abnormally high to spot the most meaningless, irrelevant virus fragments?  Why?   Because they have no obligation to tell us anything, only to get everyone tested and jabbed, so we end up on the lifelong vaccine dependency rollercoaster meant to alter our DNA and quickly, eventually, kill off our bloodlines.  My strong opinion is that a eugenics agenda is quietly barreling towards fulfillment, and it's backers are determined that nothing will stop it:   Not ethics; not God, conscience, or even the Constitution of the USA!  We are all in danger, but unfortunately, very few are aware.</p>

        <p>Check out the Stanford study on masks then tell me you trust the health diktats. Canada recalled masks previously worn by children because they're hazardous. If you want the jab fine but vaccine passports are without a doubt fascist. Also look up the german study on masks and children and the harm they cause. Ask yourself if the jab is so safe, why all the censorship? A woman got fact-checked after describing her side effects then died and you can't post a link to the story now, how come everytime I use the word vaccine on facebook I get a WHO disclaimer unless I post an article on Greta Thunberg and vaccine inequality?</p>

        <p>This is pure conjecture.  So, take it as you will.</p>
<p>The CDC and WHO knew fairly early that Covid wasn't nearly as deadly as first thought, since most deaths were among the frail elderly and those with serious comorbidities.  Nursing homes had it the worst.</p>
<p>So, the major countries (seperately) decided to use this as a test run for how the populace would tolerate real pandemic measures.  The media thrives on panic and drama.  It's more than happy to help.</p>
<p>Begin the measures, mandates and propaganda.  Now we're at the tail end of our tolerance.  So, the vaccine push is the last thing.  In a real pandemic, treatments would probably be rushed, not well tested, and risky.  So, make a big deal in the media over a small number of deaths, probably caused by the vaccine.  Then, see of people will still take it.  Also, pretend to ransom back their rights with threat of a vaccine passport until the general population is close to violence.</p>
<p>Like I said, my theory, my opinion.</p>
