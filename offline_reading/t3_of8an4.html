    <strong>Thank you to all of you, thank you</strong>
    <p><p>Quick message:</p>
<p>I'm not American nor living in the US. I'm living in Europe and I can assure you that it's so relaxing to be here on this sub. Out there people are crazy (fortunately no one I know as friends and family are enlightened and aware of what is going on, no one is vaccinated and no one attend to. I've been blessed with that). However, it's always comforting and refreshing to talk to people like-minded. You see so many people believing in covidism (it's the new religion fashionable this day. People believe in it and are ready to kill you like for any other monotheist religion). There's nothing wrong with taking care, protecting yourself and your relatives against Covid-19 (it really exists, no doubt) but it is not the Apocalypse or the end of the world. I've been fortunate enough to not have to change friends, family or acquaintance about Covid. </p>
<p>The virus killed +605,000 people in the US (not lying, it is a high absolute number of people dead. It's a lot. But don't forget that each year you've hundreds of deaths in the US alone. Absolute numbers are meant to afraid people and not let them think for themselves) but taken into perspective, the lethality rate (i.e. the number of deaths over the number of people tested positive) is only  (605k/33,7M)<em>100 = 1.79%, and the mortality rate (i.e. the number of deaths over the entire US population) is (605k/328,2M)</em>100 = 0.18%. </p>
<p>Meaning, if you catch the virus, you've a chance to survive from the disease of 98.2% (100-1.79%) and the survival rate, for the entire US population, is 99.82% (100-0.18).</p>
<p>For the world, the lethality rate is 2% (4M deaths/184M cases) which is more or less on par with US numbers. While mortality rate is even LOWER! It's like 0.05% (4M deaths/7.7 billion inhabitants)! </p>
<p>So tell people that if they're afraid of dying, they might just as well play the lottery. They might win it first.</p>
<p>What's funny is that they never speak about recoveries. Only cases and deaths.</p>
<p>As for the vaccine, why would you take a trial vaccine you don't know the side effects down the line in 6 months, 1 year, 5 or 10 years? Especially for a disease that is, like I showed above, harmless in the vast majority of cases ?</p>
<p>So just weight the risk-benefits. You know yourself. You know your medical conditions. If you're at risk and part of the vulnerable persons (old and/or with comorbidities), act accordingly and protect yourself as best as you can (you might even take the vaccine if the benefit outweighs the risk in your situation), but in majority, I don't see the reason why you'd take such a thing. Especially since pharmaceutical companies and the States (in some situations but no one had access to the contract's clauses) aren't responsible in case something happens to you.</p>
<p>Anyway. Take care, protect yourself and your relatives' health (mental and physical) and protect your elementary rights.</p>
<p>Peace ‚úåüèø</p></p>

        <p>Doesn't matter if it's true or false. Let's just take the official numbers to avoid taking the discussion on another level which won't help. Let's just assume the counting is perfectly correct (although we know many died With Covid and not because of it, and many others were false negative and died of something else but were included in the numbers). </p>
<p>What's cleverer and matters more is to use their own paradigm and their whole numbers, to take them at their own game.</p>

        <p>The previous number from CDC said that 94% of people died with covid with an average of 2.3 comorbidities. Healthy people aren't suddenly dropping dead (unless they take the vaccine). Rather, people who would be dead in a few months anyway are having their issues exacerbated.</p>
<p>Additionally, 2% is the case fatality rate. 90% of cases go undiagnosed because most people don't even get symptoms. That would put the infection survival rate at around 99.8%.</p>
<p>That is true. The case and death list just keeps growing and growing and growing. Nobody mentions the recoveries. There also isn't a season or any point in which the counter resets.</p>

        <p>Indeed, it's also possible to calculate the infection survival rate like that but as I'm not really aware of what the US CDC says, I didn't want to go deeper into that. I consider using their official numbers was enough to show how not dangerous the virus is.</p>
<p>As for the recoveries, indeed. They never speak about it. It's also true they should have reseted the numbers since it's another variant, meaning another epidemy. Basically a new season. Normally you have to reset it like they do for the flue. But bizarrely, here they'll just keep adding numbers on top... ü§î</p>

        <p>&rt;The virus killed +605,000 people</p>
<p>Well, even that number has been called into question, because they blamed everything on covid and I mean everything.  There were people dying in car crashes being marked as covid deaths.</p>
<p>Not only that, some of those people were intentionally infected, like the elderly in New York.</p>
<p>Some had something else, were misdiagnosed, mistreated and blamed on covid.</p>
<p>No, this thing was criminal, from the start.  Standing up for your rights seems more imperative, knowing all of that.  This was a pandemic, make no mistake, but the true pandemic was freedom and the cure was government tyranny.</p>

        <p>Indeed, it's true. I know that but didn't want to jump into that. It doesn't really matter they exaggerated the numbers because even with their own official numbers, the lethality and mortality rates are already very low. </p>
<p>Which is enough to show they want people to live in a mental prison of fear in order to physically (lockdown), mentally (fear), economically (if you don't take the vaccine, you can't open your shop/business or you can't work) and socially (if you don't take the vaccine, you won't be able to see your relatives, friends and have a normal life). And as a black person I used the word "slavery" on purpose because it just looks like a modern one.</p>
