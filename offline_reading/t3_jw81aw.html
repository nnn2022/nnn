    <strong>Just a thought, no masks or lockdowns for the flu. I wonder how many deaths we're all responsible for, my fellow murderers!</strong>
    <p><p>This is satire, RIP to all those that have passed however, the point still remains. We go about our life knowing flu has killed millions over the years and still takes many to this day. No masks, no lockdown.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html</a></p>
<p>For the doomsdayers:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no flu vaccine, it's a guess every year.</li>
<li>With a successful flu vaccine, people still die. Where are your masks and lockdowns FOR THEM!</li>
<li>Everyone's moral compass would be intact due to the fact that nobody would even know COVID existed if it wasn't for mass hysteria by the media. What you don't know can't hurt. Just as it doesn't with other main contributions to death across the globe such as starvation.</li>
<li>If COVID was as deadly as they made out, I would be the first in line for a vaccine.</li>
<li>Our media and government lied to us at the beginning of the pandemic in regards to masks. Please don't wear them, they're not needed! Now it's mandated and all of a sudden it's the best line of defense presently.. How many lives are the government/media responsible for?</li>
<li>Take responsibility for your own health. Want to shield yourself, by all means. Don't expect the rest of the world to follow. Want to wear a mask, fine don't expect the rest of the world to follow. Want a jab in the arm, fine protect yourself. Don't expect the rest of us to follow.</li>
</ol>
<p>Did I miss anything?</p></p>

<p>&rt;<em>Tobacco kills more than 8 million people each year. More than 7 million  of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use while</em> <strong>around 1.2  million are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke</strong> </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Cases total (Google): 55.624.562 (<strong>extremely underestimated</strong> due to many people being asymptomatic or not tested)</p>
<p>Deaths (Google): 1.338.100 (<strong>overestimated</strong> due to anyone who died within 28 days of a positive test result being counted as Corona death, even if later tests are negative)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me how illogical these people are. Diseases are natural and Corona isn't even more dangerous than a strong flu. </p>
<p>I wonder how many of them are smokers and thereby going by their logic actually kill over a million a year by doing something that is completely unnecessary.</p>

        <p>The problem is that CoVid-19 is taking out relatively or VERY healthy people like my mother.</p>
<p>69 years old, in better health than me at 39 (turned 40 soon after she died) and she died from this virus.</p>
<p>I thought that as healthy as she was, she would literally laugh at this virus and recover quickly. NYOPE!</p>
<p>That is why while I am against face diapers and lockdowns, I do think we have to do something about this virus and stopping it from spreading to the two groups that seem to have very bad issues with CoVid-19.</p>

        <p>Every disease takes out <em>some</em> very healthy people.   But statistically, this one really prefers older frail people.  I mean there is healthy and there is healthy.  </p>
<p>Who are the two groups that you refer to?   Old seems to swamp every other demographic.  Even obese is a distant second.</p>

        <p>Absolutely if they can lockdown everyone and tell me that it works then they can protect the vulnerable.</p>
