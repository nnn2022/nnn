    <strong>Here's my take on the outcome of the plannedemic</strong>
    <p><p>The governments and whatever bodies are responsible for this shit know that if they engage us military action, it would mean that most of us would have nothing left to lose. What does that open? Revolution, civil war, etc, and we will probably win because of our huge number.
They don't want that, their aim is to enslave us as calmly as possible. That's why there's probably no microchip in the vaccine or sterilization agents. It would make people angry and possibly willing to take practical action. Those 2 will come when another crisis is manufactured to convince people to get microchipped or sterilized. 
I believe they will simply choose to go with a chain of manufactured "pandemics" to demoralize the average man into accepting all their vaccines, internet ID, sterilization, climate lockdown, microchips, giving up property,etc. </p>
<p>All this time, we will only be advocating for change and exposing the lies. From what I know, no one seems to be organized for practical action (except Jurgen Conings who took a bunch of weapons and expressed his will to kill the virologist responsible for the decision-making about the pandemic in Belgium, and some protesters in Canada who blocked a truck to stop it from delivering experimental injections) and pretty much everyone is only advocating for our cause. This potentially revolutionary movement is destined to fail if we don't change, here why:</p>
<p>1)
In order to change a society in a specified way, a movement should select a single, clear, simple, and concrete objective the achievement  of which will produce the desired change.</p>
<p>But what are our goals?
Bring back to old normal? Very vague, and the current historical trend doesn't help it, so it is doomed to fail</p>
<p>Prosecute war criminals? Fighting the enemy by going through their own system? Good luck with that.</p>
<p>2)
If a movement aims to transform a society, then the objective selected by the movement must be of such a nature that, once the objective has been achieved, its consequences will be irreversible.</p>
<p>Let's look at the people who did act in some way cited above.
Jurgen Conings: His goal was very clear (stopping virologists from deciding the fate of his country) but it wasn't irreversible. Even if he succeeds to kill the virologists in power, other ones could just be put in place easily and granted private security. 
The Canadian road blockers: their goals was very clear and not ambiguous, the problem is that even if they miraculously manage to stop every truck out there, helicopters will be rolled out. Their objective's consequences are easily reversible and won't even acheive much.</p>
<p>3)
Once an objective has been selected, it is necessary to persuade some small minority to commit itself to the achievement of the objective by means more potent than mere preaching or advocacy of ideas. In other words, the minority will have to organize itself for practical action.</p>
<p>The advocacy of ideas alone cannot change society, at least in the modern today, so some group will have to be organized for the purpose of applying methods more potent than mere advocacy of ideas. This group will ordinarily include only a very small minority because only a very small minority can be persuaded to act.</p>
<p>4)
In order to keep itself faithful to its objective, a revolutionary movement should devise means of excluding from its ranks all unsuitable persons who may seek to join it</p>
<p>This can be important because the admission of unsuitable persons will promote the blurring or perversion of the movement's objective.</p>
<p>List of unsuitable people that might blur our movement:
Qtards
Actual antivaxxers
Troll bots
Paid doomer brigades
Politician worshippers
Etc</p>
<p>Tldr:</p>
<p>In any conflict situation in which victory is uncertain, it is always essential to concentrate one's efforts on the achievement of the single most critical objective.</p>
<p>The objective must be of such a nature that once achrived, its consequrnces will be hard if not impossible to cancel.</p>
<p>If we want our movement to be successful, some of us will have to be dedicated to it and actually act instead of preach</p>
<p>We must exclude anyone who is susceptible of blurring our goals, at least in the group that will organize itself for practical action.</p>
<p>If you think I'm wrong, want to criticize my post or want to suggest anything, I'd love to hear it, please comment.</p></p>

        <p>I just don't believe the vaccines are placebos. The Global Government poured TRILLIONS of $$$ into the Covid-19 plan over 16+ months so they wouldn't let people off the hook. This is their chance and magic moment to have humans take the vaccines, they might never get another chance like this. I truly believe that the vaccines are human sterilizers. Less people is the goal, they want 2 billion on earth by 2030. It's like a farmer running around injecting pigs, cattle, and sheep with injections, this is a mass scale depopulation plan just look at how they take pictures of those inoculated and mock them, look at how they reward them with incentives/prizes/donuts. My instincts say depopulation, my research led me to conclude that. </p>

        <p>If it was strictly about depopulation, you'll see them prioritizing their vaccines for Africa and the Middle East. In those regions, many countries are using IVM and HCQ instead of vaccines. In Western countries howerver, HCQ and Ivermectin were ignored and suppressed because they would end the pandemic and render vaccines useless, ending their EUA. Vaccines on the other side, generate huge amounts of money and enable the acceptance of a surveillance state. For example, the pro-vax people in my class have accepted that people will not be able to go to college without getting the shot. If the govt can mandate a vaccine for a virus with 0.07% average death rate, it can mandate many more things on its population. The push of vaccines is on everyone, even those with no risk from the virus, even those who already got natural immunity. They just want to have more control of everybody, at least in Western countries, mainly because there is  enough surveillance infrastructure compared to 2nd and 3rd world countries. There, you can't mandate the vaccine for pretty much everything because people are poor and are already deep in the illegal and because bribery is morally acceptable  (insane laws and extreme poverty). Bringing microchips and sterilization discreetly in the vaccines would cause revolutions and civil wars, the elites don't want that. They will simply demoralize the average human into accepting whatever solution they present for the right to participate in the modern Industrial System. They will sterilize and microchip people when they manufacture a good crisis for that. Don't think there will only be a C-19 plannedemic, there is more to come. The next one will be what the "Cyber-Pandemic" anticipated by Cyber Polygon. I believe they will cut off everyone's electricity to slow the spread of the "cyber-virus". When people start dying as the system they rely on to live is turned off, they will grant a UBI in exchange of all rights to personal property and anonymity. Chains of manufactured pandemics are to come, each one made to enslave you in a particular way. Why sterilize people by force and risk an uprising of revolutions when they can make people think that sterilization is for their good?</p>

        <p>I live in a small city in Morocco and 99% of the people here don't care about the mask mandate or the 11pm curfew. Yesterday I was  chilling with my uncle at 11pm, the police came in with a van and told people to go home and to close their shops. Nobody moved. The beta police just retreated knowing there was nothing they could do. </p>
<p>I'm pretty confident our village-like city will stand strong against the incoming mandatory vaccination too. Do you think majority opinion and support is possible in Western countries? If so, do you have examples of it or how could Westerners acheive it?</p>

        <p>Morocco is quite different than Canada :D hard to even compare or even be able for me to conceptualize such a different way of life.</p>
<p>In the West, though people have become too comfortable and have taken their freedoms for granted - and don't appreciate them enough , or the value of human rights - and they are weak as a result.</p>
<p>Canadians (and Americans but not so much) were paid $2000 a month and more as 'emergency benefits' to help them get through the worst of the emergency, but turned into near 2 years all said and told of benefits - that not only made them complacent and apathetic - but also is contributing to the bankrupting and super-inflation of their country as a result.</p>
<p>This allowed FEAR and SUSPICION and not FACTS, to rule Canada, as too many people were benefiting from $$$ to support the narrative, all while the rest of us with businesses, livelihoods, and such were shut down.</p>
<p>For the most part, The Cult of The Mask and Vax have been very successful in Canada, but hasn't gone as far as Israel (yet) in the implementation of an actual Covid19 passport, though the possibility remains.</p>
<p>The USA is similar, but the USA doesn't tolerate the trampling of their rights as much, and have the ability to back it up with force if necessary.</p>

        <p>Yes. Hoping they will crack if more stores take the Mask signs down.. With choice we can start to vote again with our wallets.<br>
It's been 12 months with no choice and I was getting very irritated and the trampling of my rights over this crap.</p>
<p>There are a few stores I would expect to do it first. Save on, London Drugs, Canadian Tire but I haven't been out to them yet to check, they were the last to do it (I suspect they didn't want to), and my local farm market opened today... there was 90% mask shopping though, but when mandates go away, when the store sign goes away - NONE OF THESE PEOPLE SAY ANYTHING BECAUSE THEIR POWER IS GONE.</p>
