    <strong>Obstetric Violence and Masking</strong>
    <p><p><strong>"No" means "No". Every time a mask is required of a non consenting woman during labor it is an act of obstetric violence.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://birthmonopoly.com/obstetric-violence/">https://birthmonopoly.com/obstetric-violence/</a></p>
<p>"There is  no doubt that the pandemic has set back global efforts to  improve the  health and well-being of women and children, but that should  only serve  to strengthen our resolve," said Dr Tedros Adhanom  Ghebreyesus, WHO  Director-General. </p>
<p><strong>The Covid-1984 Pandemic burden is too much for families and children. Women are having to risk their lives and the lives of their babies to conform to ridiculous non-consensual sanitation theater.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8834045/Women-France-felt-like-suffocating-forced-wear-face-masks-childbirth.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8834045/Women-France-felt-like-suffocating-forced-wear-face-masks-childbirth.html</a></p>
<p>&rt;Before the summer, 46 per cent of women  giving birth were made to wear face masks, now that number has risen to  over 80 per cent,' she said.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;She also  provided a map of France showing the number of what they categorised as  cases of obstetrical violence, meaning poor medical care or  discriminatory practices, that women reported to them. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;They  are colour-coded ranging from green, 0 to 1 cases of violence, to  yellow, 2 to 3 cases of violence, to orange, more than four cases of  violence per woman.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The President at the National College of  Midwives of France, Adrien Gantois, believes the figure is higher now  than before the pandemic, and has argued that the focus should be on  protecting staff by giving them improved PPE, as they do in the UK and  the US, and has called for a localised review of the practice.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;He said: 'Wearing a mask during delivery is not practical.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;'The  maternity hospitals that make it compulsory during this major physical  exertion need to review their policy and prioritise the wearing of an  FFP2 mask for the carers'.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18485167/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18485167/</a></p>
<p>&rt;Compared  with women with an intermediate level of psychological stress  during  pregnancy, women with a high level of stress had 80% increased  risk of  stillbirth (relative risk = 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-3.2).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/covid-19-threatens-undo-decade-progress-women-childrens-health/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/covid-19-threatens-undo-decade-progress-women-childrens-health/</a></p>
<p>&rt;Around 118 <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/05/11/coronavirus-will-worsen-inequality-years-come-imf-warns/">low- and middle income countries</a> have   reported more than 1.1 million additional child deaths and an   additional 56,700 maternal deaths due to a reduction of essential   maternal and child-health interventions since the coronavirus crisis   began.<br>
There has also been a surge  in reports of abuse directed at girls and  women, with an additional 31  million cases of gender-based violence  documented over the six months  of lockdowns.<br>
Reversals in  learning outcomes due to school closures have already  affected 1.6  billion children, and an additional 150 million additional  children  have been plunged into poverty by the far-reaching  socio-economic  impacts of the pandemic.<br>
"There is  no doubt that the pandemic has set back global efforts to  improve the  health and well-being of women and children, but that should  only serve  to strengthen our resolve," said Dr Tedros Adhanom  Ghebreyesus, WHO  Director-General. </p></p>

        <p>The article says that the CDC does not recommend masks during labor, but I have a hard time finding their "official guidance", they certainly say ridiculous things like 'wear a mask during breastfeeding' and 'keep 6' apart from baby' if you have cold symptoms. 
There are so many normal side effects to pregnancy, including stuffy nose, that using their guidance it would certainly appear they intend to mask most new mothers.
Edit: Congrats!!</p>

        <p>Lol...honestly, I have no idea what they would do.  That’s part of where my anxiety is coming from.  Just the not knowing how they will now handle things.  This is also my 3rd and final baby.  I was hoping for this to be a really warm and wonderful experience but it’s mostly been nerves and uncertainty.  It’s a sucky situation.</p>

        <p>I hope women who are pregnant now are seriously looking at home births. No way I would set foot in a hospital to give birth if they said I had to wear a muzzle or my husband couldn’t be with me.</p>

        <p>It is possible to have an 'unattended' birth in the hospital. I know friends who had one only because the MDs and RNs disappeared at the wrong time. Unfortunately, Women have always needed to be prepared to fight off unwanted medical interventions when giving birth in the hospital. 
We're capable of anything. What bullshit they are trying to clamp down on our reproductive freedom right now. So typical though.
'Spiritual Midwifery' by Ina Mae Gaskin is a great book that pregnant women should read. It is very empowering, I hope women walk into childbirth knowing their bodies are on their side (and there are a few tricks in there to keep everything in sync).</p>
