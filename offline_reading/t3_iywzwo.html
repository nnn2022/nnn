        <p>I've seen the videos like this coming out of Australia... I never thought I'd see something like this in the United States. I'm so fearful of the world we're living in.</p>
<p>This pisses me off so much. She's outside and clearly isn't within the magical 6 feet of anyone outside of her own family.</p>
<p>I like to think that 30 years ago, the other people there would've rallied behind her and took a stand.</p>

        <p>This doesn't surprise me at all.</p>
<p>We've already seen stuff like this in the US. Remember the couple in KY who got put under house arrest, with ankle monitors, due to refusing to sign papers to promise not to leave their homes so they can quarantine after testing positive? Yeah.</p>
<p>We're going to see more and more stuff like this. A lot more.</p>

<p>Unfortunately you are right.  It's going to get a lot worse. </p>
<p>All for a virus I have a 99.98% chance of surviving, even if I get it in the first place...  Just proves it's not about the virus at all.  It's about control.  We are not allowed to question anything anymore.  We're not allowed to ask about the data or "science" used to justify any of this.  Just blindly obey and put a piece of paper on your face and everything will be fine, citizen.</p>

<p>Does that mean that you don't give a shit about anybody else?   Does everyone you come into contact with have a 99.98% chance of surviving?  How many only have a 50/50 ?   To bad for them that you don't appreciate a super minor inconvenience for the next 6 months or so.</p>

        <p>I don't dislike you.  And..yes in a pandemic you are supposed to assume , or rather behave as if, everyone is infected and contagious all the time....including yourself!</p>
<p>If everone acted with those assumptions the pan demic would have been over by now.</p>
<p>Why weren't your community leaders explaining this to you???!!</p>

        <p>It's mostly because school administrators and board members tend to lean left regardless of what state. And yeah, they like to think of themselves as their own government and anything they say goes.</p>

        <p>Probably not... I highly doubt she was arrested for not wearing a mask. More likely she was told to put it on and refused, he than told her it was school policy to wear a mask and if she refused she would have to leave. She probably refused to leave and was then arrested for trespassing. </p>
<p>The school can absolutely tell people who refuse to follow their rules to leave. If they don't they can be arrested for trespassing. What is her case going to be? "I thought it was a stupid rule so refused even though they told me if I didn't I would have to leave. When they told me to leave I thought that was stupid so refused that also. Which yea, that's the exact definition of trespassing but it's stupid so this case should be dismissed."?</p>

        <p>you are correct. she was resisting after they told her to put her hands behind her back to be escorted outside. he even warned her that he would taze her if she did not comply, to which she kept resisting. he zapped her once in order to arrest her. she was arrested for trespassing, after being asked to leave.</p>

<p>Imagine this? </p>
<p>You're there. This woman gets tased. You stand up, and go "Hey! Stop it! Don't do that, you pieces of shit! This is wrong!" The crowd now turns against you. They are riled up from the situation with the woman rejecting the mask so then they begin cursing you, insulting you, and quickly escalate to more aggression. They begin to chuck stuff at you, and begin to close in. You're there with your family, so the crowd also goes after them. They get pissed, and begin to throw punches and/or otherwise assault you, and also turn their attention on your spouse and children. They won't and don't stop, because in their minds, they are justified in attacking "the (disease vector) threats" that are you, and your "despicable anti-masker" family.</p>

        <p>You can imagine it that way all day, that’s not what happened and from what I saw actually several people were speaking up and when she got tased that man stood up and went over. Sorry but I still would have stood up and not thought about the fear of people hurting me because that’s my nature. If people hurt children over it then I guess we would set the stage to expose something that would end this, after all who would condone children being hurt? Also at the point a mob or crowd would start to attack people I would guess that shit cop or maybe the other one who came over not wearing a mask would have an ethical duty to actually defend people against harm and not arrest a woman not wearing a mask outside. Also lawsuits would come down against that school and all who participated. </p>
<p>All I’m saying is, my nature would have been to stand up for what’s right and I don’t always weigh the risks before I act or speak up.</p>

<p>People who believe they are righteous, and condone the "undesirables" being hurt or killed, even if they are children. See: The Salem Witch Trials, The Holocaust, other situations of hysteria, fear, and panic that emboldened people to commit horrendous acts, including against children.</p>

        <p>I believe you and I know children have been hurt but I also believe that IS where the majority of moral and people with true values draw the line. I would literally put myself in harms way and even potential death to instinctively save a child. At least that’s how I see myself. I can’t explain it except through my experience of childbirth, to which even words wouldn’t give the bond or emotions justice. </p>
<p>I remember a story of a lady who jumped a fence when seeing a kid being attacked by an aggressive dog and she sheltered the child and allowed the dog to rip her flesh from her own body, it moved me emotionally. I knew I would do that if I was in the same position. I believe most people actually would. </p>
<p>I want to believe we have come a long way since the atrocities of the holocaust, sadly though I am not above saying I could be entirely wrong, and if that happens I will fight if I need to.</p>

<p>Meh...I really, really disagree that we've come a long way since then. Humans are idiots, and selfish, and prone to violence and other malice. In fact, this whole situation reads very similar to what I've seen in studies of WWI and WWII Germany, and how it escalated into the holocaust. Fear ramped up into paranoia? Check. Government propaganda campaign? Check. Riling up the masses against certain groups (ie "anti-maskers")? Check. "Do your part, be a good person, and report misdeeds to the state"? Check. Aggression towards "undesirables"? Check. </p>
<p>Logic is being thrown out the window right now, because people allowed their fear to cloud their judgment. Same as it did back then. I shake my head when people say "Gee, now I get why the holocaust happened!". Um, you think, guys? If more people paid attention during history class in middle and high school, maybe we would have less people get tricked into the current mentality going around. That, and knowing that history often does repeat itself, because many human beings just plain suck.</p>

<p>This is where we differ, I guess. I think it's the opposite, and the "pandemic" has exposed just how fucked up most people are, deep down.</p>
<p>&rt; I don’t see train cars being pulled up yet to heard us like cattle, not here not yet.</p>
<p>This probably won't happen, not anytime soon at this rate. No, they will herd us like cattle in subtler ways with more surveillance, less freedoms, more restrictions, shoving shit like "health passports" down our throats, etc.</p>
<p>&rt; As for the global reset and collapsing our economy and all of us probably heading for some dark days and hard times, that I see happening.</p>
<p>Oh, I believe so... A lot of people here are in denial that this will happen. God, I wish I could be in denial about this as well, but shit's going to get very ugly, very fast if/when this happens...</p>

        <p>I’ve seen it too as well as I have thrown it out a few times, also you’re right I am kinda sorta joking but also I’m dead serious. We have even talked about selling the house we just bought as soon as early next year and fleeing to a larger piece of land and way more remote. There is still large chunks around us very remote for reasonably cheap prices. As of now the government can’t and isn’t stopping movement or people selling and leaving. I’m seeing people leave by the dozens in certain neighborhoods and the houses are selling quick.</p>

        <p>It's hard to quantify how many people are truly scared of the virus and buying into all of it, vs. how many are just going along with it vs. how many just don't care, vs. how many that are trying to push back. If I had to guess I would say maybe 20% doomer, 30% going along, 30% ignoring / not caring and 20% anti-doomer. Maybe +/- 10% in either direction, it's hard to say. </p>
<p>The biggest factor for doomers seems to be how plugged into mainstream culture they are. There is still a lot of people particularly those that are 50 or 60+ age range who for them, watching TV is a daily ritual that they have been doing in many cases since they were a small child as long as they can remember. Difficult to overestimate how much influence TV programming has on certain people and how stuck in their ways they are. Sitting on the couch flipping through channels and watching commercial after commercial, this is how many spend their free time, and before the internet it was obviously way more commonplace and there wasn't much for alternate forms of media. Countless memories of hanging out with the family in the living room after dinner watching TV until bedtime, or watching cartoons all weekend long. But the truth is it is almost a perfect propaganda machine, the 24 hr news cycle being some of the worst of it, but it is actually everywhere no matter what you watch. Same mainstream narratives are built into nearly every show, and even the stuff that isn't blatant propaganda and actually good, they still split it up into 5 minute segments with 5 - 10 minute commercial breaks in between blasting you nonstop with their messaging. It didn't use to be as bad pre-9/11, or at least they seemed to be a lot more subtle with it. I have only been at a place that had the news playing on TV once so far since this all started, but holy fuck are the commercials worse than ever and pushing the whole pro-mask pro-lockdown thing so hard. Ad for Uber that played about 6 times in 45 minutes that basically just said no mask no service (wow take my money!). I actually feel like I am being psychologically abused everytime I watch TV, especially with the commercials. Now imagine what it is like to fully embrace and accept what you see and making it your #1 hobby for decades. </p>
<p>For the doomers that aren't glued to the TV, it is still the same propaganda machine roping them in through their various tentacles. Instead of watching CNN or w/e on TV they will go to the website and read their headlines and watch their 30 second video clips, or watch clips on youtube. Or they will read NYT or whatever other mainstream news publication. Or maybe they get all their news from Jon Oliver and Trever Noah instead. Even on the radio while driving it is not much better with the kinds of messaging they put out, the commercials and the news updates. You can't even go see a movie without 30 minutes of commercials, product placement and propaganda messages throughout. </p>
<p>The other main aspect besides the media is the institutional, government and big corporate side. If it wasn't for the mandated shutdowns and the ridiculous amount of new policies put in place from the top down that nobody lower in the ladder can do anything about without losing their job... I think way way less people would be bothering with any of this. Considering people need money to live and if they lose out on their main source of income during these times they may not be getting another job anytime soon... makes sense to just go a long with the dumb rules and keep your mouth shut. </p>
<p>Anyway idk where I am going with this but hope you enjoyed the ramble lol</p>

        <p>I think you're off about the age range of those who are drawn in by TV news. I'm over 50 and many people like me remember the pre 9/11 days when the media did not blatantly spin the news to support a narrative. We also remember the better days before CNN, when there was less sensationalizing of stories to keep eyes glued to the channel. TV news shows used to only have a few hours of programming per day so they didn't have to fill air time with talking heads and "developing stories" that are drawn out way beyond their importance. I admit to watching the news, but I don't eat it up. These days, it mostly just fuels my rants.</p>

        <p>This is a great video for exactly the reasons you’re alluding to. When someone sees this do they see “officer assaulting woman for not wearing mask” or “woman tased after repeatedly resisting an officer”? Now show them the Eric Garner video. Do they see “man choked by cop for selling loose cigarettes” or “man restrained by police after repeatedly resisting officer”? I think your instincts are right, the majority of people will have internal conflicts to resolve, or make excuses for.</p>

<p>Do you honestly think that makes any sense? Read it again slowly then realise that your brain isn't up to the task of having input on matters of human rights.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm still yet to see reputable scientific proof for asymptomatic spread so if you have some then please do share. It was made up to scare you into submission.  And no the CDC saying that there "may be evidence for asymptomatic spread" does not count. It's been 7 months, if it was true, there would be reputable papers proving it by now.</p>
<p>That's why I don't wear a mask. You can shout and shame all you want but it doesn't mean I'm going to start doing things that make no sense.</p>

        <p>Blow out a candle, without a mask at 1ft away. 
Try it again with a standard surgical mask. </p>
<p>That will be you, limiting air velocity. Guess how airborne viruses transmit? If you guessed by the air, you're correct! </p>
<p>Try it again at 2ft, then 3ft, 4ft etc...
This is simple science. This isn't my opinion or rough estimate. </p>
<p>You misunderstand being educated for being afraid. </p>
<p>Asymptomatic research can be found here: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/current</p>
<p>Furthermore, if this is all just a <em>very</em> elaborate ploy the worst you have done is wear a mask for the sake of your fellow people. The very lack of compassion here (with a hint of willful ignorance) is what makes you selfish. </p>

        <p>Aside from the fact that anyone arresting this woman or watching this woman get arrested without protest are BARBARIANS, it's becoming more clear to me that virus spread will increase with this ridiculous mob mentality.</p>
<p>I live in Maine and the public health officials say, there is no pin in the map for coronavirus, the whole state is under the pin.</p>
<p>It emerged today that a nursing home outbreak was caused by a sick person, reporting they were sick, and then going to work anyway because nobody told them not to.</p>
<p>Initially there was loads of propaganda saying the outbreak was caused by a wedding, blah blah finger pointing deluge of hatespeech. </p>
<p>I guarantee the employee was wearing a face mask, and probably thought she couldn't spread it.</p>
<p>When public health officials take on the whole populace instead of focusing their efforts where they are needed most -NURSING HOMES- they're not doing their one fucking job which is- to stop people from dying of coronavirus.</p>
<p>People need to put on their big boy pants and tell the public health Nazis to cram their facemasks up their asses and do their job.</p>

        <p>Like I wrote in my other comments, most of them are supportive of this while the rest who aren't are scared of retaliation. I really don't think we're in a majority right now.</p>
