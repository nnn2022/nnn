    <strong>My whole life has been ruined, I'm now suffering from severe depression, and no one will be held accountable for it.</strong>
    <p><p>I lost the second half of my junior year of high school.</p>
<p>I lost my ENTIRE senior year. Ok, well they're reopening in the beginning of May, four weeks before I graduate with masks and desk shields everywhere. Thanks, you really just saved the school year!</p>
<p>Let's try recalling the Governor. Oh awesome, we actually got the number of signatures, I'm actually kinda surprised! <em>He's leading in the polls by 10% and should still win easily.</em></p>
<p>I'll feel better in college! <em>No word on when masks won't be mandated anymore at the college I am going to</em></p>
<p>Let's protest this! <em>And get a sad number of people out</em></p>
<p>Let's not get the vaccine as protest! <em>Everyone is getting the vaccine, even kids my age recently</em></p>
<p>My life has been ruined, I have not talked to other teenager since March 2020 IRL (not an exaggeration here), and I rarely ever leave my room. And who will be held accountable for this?</p>
<p>Nobody.</p></p>

        <p>A big part of what is going on is trying to get people who disagree with the narrative to feel alone and unable to talk about their perspective.</p>

        <p>Yeah, TPTB want a surveillance technocracy. Still, you're jumping the gun a little bit. I'm in a deep blue state but most people I encounter don't buy the whole narrative (yet). Many people in their 20s have lost their livelihoods and direction and we're still getting by somehow. Chin up, little bro. It'll be alright.</p>
