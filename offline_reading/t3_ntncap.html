        <p>Neither myself or my family are getting the shot. I honestly could care less what people think I am whether it be selfish or a conspiracy theorist because I don’t live my life for them and the pathetic attempts at shaming doesn’t effect me as I’m immune to stupidity. I had several high risk family members recover from Covid last year using HCQ. This medication was called dangerous by Fraudci and the MSM but I knew he was lying last year. My daughter is in her 20’s and could care less about being shamed or called a conspiracy theorist because I taught her the importance of critical thinking skills. She is smart enough to know that Social Media Platforms are not the subject matter experts for health related decisions. A lot of individuals fell victim to fear which is a very convincing marketing tool.</p>

        <p>I know from other sites I’m active on that individuals who came down with Covid and wanted those meds contacted America’s Frontline Doctors (they have a website) who then put them in contact with a doctor in the area they live in who would write the script for those medications. We were lucky with our family members because the infectious disease doctor who treated them at the hospital used HCQ/Zinc/Z-PAC  combo. All had pre-existing medical conditions and all survived and recovered quickly with that antibiotic therapy. This was almost a year ago so imagine how many lives would of been saved had they not hid the truth.</p>

        <p>thats good info!  i was almost wondering if since they arent controlled substances if there were foreign countries able to ship or whatnot.  i’ll keep looking around.  not sure how pessimistic you are, and part of me is hoping for a return to normalcy but the proclamations of the wef, plus the previous issues with ADE and other priming, and alternatively there being motive by big power to want unvaxced to receive harm/infection, makes me at least want a supply of this stuff on standby.  its really rough, at least where i am, how it can all feel so inescapably bearing down on us, and with some really weird and dystopian outcomes for our society.</p>

        <p>I took HCQ when I was deployed. It’s a fairly common antibiotic so I’d think countries like Canada or Mexico may have a mail order for it. It’s good to have some on standby. I’m fully optimistic we will overcome this event. The truth is beginning to surface. Once it’s fully out, we can begin to start the healing process.</p>

        <p>So, in relation to the Pfizer vaccine :</p>
<ul>
<li>The active substance is BNT162b2 RNA.
After dilution, the vial contains 6 doses, of 0.3 mL with 30 micrograms mRNA each. The vaccine contains polyethylene glycol/macrogol (PEG) as part of ALC-0159
The other ingredients are:</li>
</ul>
<p>ALC-0315 = (4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate)
ALC-0159 = 2[(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide
1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
cholesterol
potassium chloride
potassium dihydrogen phosphate
sodium chloride
disodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate
sucrose
water for injections</p>
<ul>
<li>it was developed by Pfizer Bio N Tech.</li>
<li>it was manufactured by Pfizer and Bio N Tech.</li>
<li>their track record in developing products that significantly assist people with health issues is excellent. They have a huge number of products on the market to tackle a range of issues. There has been no issues with any medical products they have developed. Like all pharmaceutical companies, they have had legal issues when it comes to aggressive marketing, and have paid fines in relation to this. But none of these fines have been for health related issues.</li>
<li>Pfizer and Bio N Tech have the same legal liability for vaccine development that every single other vaccine developer has had in the History of vaccines. There is nothing different about their Covid vaccine in terms of legal liability.</li>
<li>in terms of testing, the Covid vaccine has been through identical processes as every other vaccine. The MHRA is an independent body and so is the Commission on Human Medicines, which also had a say in the decision to approve the vaccine in the UK. Scientists have been studying coronaviruses for over 50 years. This meant scientists had existing data on the structure, genome, and life cycle of this type of virus. Testing was not started from scratch.</li>
<li>everyone is telling you to get it.</li>
<li>it is effective for everyone.</li>
<li>no vaccine is necessary. Paracetamol or ibuprofen or Tylenol aren't necessary when you have a headache but they help. The vaccines help reduce your risk even further than where it may already be due to your age.</li>
<li>the volume of side effects reported vs number of vaccines given is tiny. Absolutely tiny. It is in the region of 0.0001% and continuing to drop further as more vaccines are given out.</li>
</ul>

<p>So zero. "Hey, let me inject you with something. It will probably help you, but if it kills you it's no skin off my nose. Besides, you know it's safe since we spend millions of dollars to make sure that anybody who has information to the contrary gets punished for sharing it."</p>

        <p>Nope. Remember the coof is so different from every other coronavirus, that at the same time Moderna was guessing at a recipe, we had to abandon all the proven coronavirus treatments that would have stopped this thing in its tracks. </p>
<p>So either: it was right to do that, in which case moderna's recipe, and likely everyone else's, are based on bad science that needed to be dropped, in which case the vaccine is not necessary and likely dangerous...</p>
<p>Or: the standard coronavirus measures that would have stopped this in its tracks were suppressed in order to scaremonger until people thought that a new vaccine was their only hope. In which case the standard over-the-counter treatments that would have stopped this in its tracks should be used, since they're far cheaper to produce, easier to distribute, more effective, and have fewer side effects.</p>

        <p>You (and many others) certainly are passionate about this.  And I unconditionally support your right to state your views.</p>
<p>So: 
Get the vaccination of your choice...
And let the rest of us make our own decision based on what we conclude is best for us.</p>
<p>IOW, no mandates, no vaccine passports. No censorship of opposing views. Free choice for all.</p>

<p>&rt;Pfizer and Bio N Tech have the same legal liability for vaccine development that every single other vaccine developer has had in the History of vaccines.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/covid-vaccine-side-effects-compensation-lawsuit.html">You can’t sue Pfizer or Moderna if you have severe Covid vaccine side effects. The government likely won't compensate you for damages either</a></p>
<p>&rt;in terms of testing, the Covid vaccine has been through identical processes as every other vaccine.</p>
<p>It isn't even FDA approved.</p>
<p>&rt;everyone is telling you to get it.</p>
<p>If everyone told you to jump off a bridge, would you?</p>
<p>&rt;it is effective for everyone.</p>
<p>There's no reason for anyone under 50 to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt;no vaccine is necessary.</p>
<p>Then why do you care if we don't get it?</p>
<p>&rt;the volume of side effects reported vs number of vaccines given is tiny. Absolutely tiny.</p>
<p>The WuFlu vaccine has killed more than any other vaccine in the last 20 years. And we haven't even seen long term effects.</p>
