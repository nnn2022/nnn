    <strong>Klaus Schwab says going outside helps fight COVID-19</strong>
    <p><p>From his book, <em>COVID-19: The Great Reset</em>:</p>
<p>&rt;To improve our chances of resisting the virus, immunity must be boosted and inflammation suppressed. What part does nature play in this scenario? She is the leading lady, the science now tells us! The low-level of constant inflammation experienced by our bodies leads to all sorts of diseases and disorders, ranging from cardiovascular conditions to depression and reduced immune capabilities. This residual inflammation is more prevalent among people who live in cities, urban environments and industrialized areas. It is now established that a lack of connection with nature is a contributing factor to greater inflammation, with studies showing that just two hours spent in a forest can alleviate inflammation by lowering cytokine levels (a marker of inflammation)</p>
<p>Like other immuno-suppressant measures, lockdowns which force people to stay inside run flagrantly <em>against</em> pre-lockdown science.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly, his book is a surprise. He's not a lockdown fanatic or a doomer (he specifically says COVID-19 isn't that dangerous compared to past pandemics); he's just speculating.</p>

        <p>I literally just said the same thing without having seen your comment. He and his WEF ilk are just gaming this to push their 'Great Reset' ecofascist technocratic dystopia. </p>
<p>Not sure if you watched the opining address of the 2021 WEF, but he was making C19 sound like the worst thing that's happened to mankind in aeons. Double-speak 101.</p>

        <p>I read his grimoire last year and was stunned at how clear he made it that C19 is nowhere near as dangerous as was previously feared. These psychos are always candid in their books but advocate for policies that are diametrically opposite.</p>

        <p>They get away with it because the media covers for them and most people are too lethargic to do any amount of independent research for themselves. For example, Herr Schwab's family history is unknown - it's as if he materialised from the ether. If we were to know his family's past, it would undoubtedly lead to Nazism.</p>

        <p>I absolutely agree with him and that's something I've been saying for a while too, fresh air, exercise and sunlight is very important in boosting the immune system!</p>
