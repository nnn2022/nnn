        <p>They want them to shut down private gatherings in people's houses.  Go visit your brother,  get a $1000 ticket or whatever the fine is in in LA or Orange County.  Naturally, this is a no-win situation for the police, in a state where the laws are against things like petty theft are barely enforced.    For example, our car was broken into.  They didn't come out, you have to file a police report online for your insurance.  Even though it was in a shopping plaza, where they usually hit a bunch of cars at once.  So the thieves could still have been around.  Well, attempted thieves, they just broke the windows to see if there was anything to steal.  So, instead of looking into actual crimes, the police can run around issuing tickets to people visiting friends and family and busy body neighbors can tie up 911 informing on their neighbors.</p>

        <p>&rt; Reingold said it could also be time for California to consider more aggressively enforcing rules like its mask requirement and ban on gatherings. To this point the state has mostly relied on people voluntarily complying with those rules or has put the onus on businesses.</p>
<p>Good luck on having the LAPD enforce a new shelter in place.  I am sure that will go well.  It only worked in March because most people were afraid.</p>

        <p>It's not going to be enough.  What we have here is a virus that is <em>so</em> serious and widespread that we have to be tested to know whether or not we even <em>have</em> it in many cases.  Plus, even if you are asymptomatic, and don't know if you have it, you just <em>might</em> have complications from it.  In fact, there is evidence that even if you get it and survive you will end up dying from it eventually, perhaps even within 40 to 50 years.  Mask it, better than a casket.</p>

        <p>Of course not. Whatever is done is not enough. What "enough" is, has not, and will never be defined. When it isn't clear what is needed or how to solve any problem, many people default to saying that the government should "do something." In order to remain relevant, the government does something. When it doesn't understand the problem or does but cannot effectively do anything, the responsible thing to do is step back and say so. Can you remember the last time the government did that? </p>
<p>As long as people are afraid, they'll ask for more "something," and the government will keep bringing it.</p>
