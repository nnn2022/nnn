        <p>Because there is an entire generation that has no idea what civil liberties and God given rights actually are. They have no idea how valuable they are. And, most importantly, they have no idea how many people died, fighting, just so we could have them. Sadly, the people who make up this generation won't understand any of this until its too late. We will see them crying in the streets, only after we have lost the few freedoms we have left.</p>

        <p>I am a generation Z’er and this shit kills me. It’s as if history is being actively re written with all the censorship and removal of stuff. It makes me wonder when these people will wake up. My generation is being brain washed and institutionalized at every level. Even college. Someday they will see and it will be too late.</p>

        <p>That is correct. And, while I'm not, by definition, a very religious person, it is very clear that God has been removed from just about everything as well. I have to think that this makes it pretty tough for anyone to understand the idea of God given rights. </p>
<p>The unfortunate reality is, the situation we are currently in has happened before. We seem to be in the middle of a, "fall of Rome" kind of moment. Similar power structures are fighting for what they want. One side knows that erasing history must be done in order to shift the power and control. What amazes me the most, I think, is the fact that those who the ability to guard against what is happening today, didn't. I'm kind of amazed at how unprepared we were for this moment. Nobody seems to have a response to, pretty much, everything that has happened recently. So, I guess we all just have to walk through this and see what's on the other side. It's gonna suck. I think it's going to get much worse. And, I think it's going to to last for a lot longer than most realize.</p>

        <p>You’re absolutely right. We’re so distracted by this fall or collapse because we do have luxuries and technology unlike ever before. It’s the greatest distraction along side the media being so fake it’s a perfect recipe for this. Only some people are really awake to what’s happening and what is really to come. We know now more than ever what’s happening but like you said seem we all seemed unprepared. This is what they want.</p>

<p>r/politics is full of grown men who spend their best years jerking off to celebrities like Fauci. They turn themselves into women and fantasize about getting fucked by stronger men and will never go on to reproduce because their own politics have brainwashed and sissified them</p>
<p>They enjoy the lockdowns because they had sad lives before covid. They enjoy using the state as a tool against those that disagree with their ideology</p>
