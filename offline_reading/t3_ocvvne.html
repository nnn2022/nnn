    <strong>Imagine having such low self-esteem that you think your life should be dictated and led by some socially inept scientist who is probably bought by the government or too scared to speak out against the established narrative.</strong>
    <p><p>Guess what? Scientists aren't infallible. They can be just as corrupt, greedy or wrong as any other human being. Not to mention there ARE scientists that are speaking out against what's going on, who think masks and lockdowns and experimental, rushed "vaccines" are bullshit and dangerous, yet they're censored, deplatformed and demonized by the media because they are going against the narrative and threatening their cash cow and plans for their glorious, Utopian Great Reset. I'm more inclined to trust a scientist that is putting his job, reputation and life on the line for no conceivable benefit to tell what he believes is the truth over some cringing toadie toeing the party line for fame, money and power.</p>
<p>I think it's a safe bet that these fucking lab coats have no idea how the real world functions. They might think it's a good idea to collapse the economy to save a few lives from a cold virus but the fallout from that is going to claim many more. Living like this is unsustainable without the social comforts and technological advancements we have at our disposal; in any other period of time this shit would not have flown. It would simply be impossible. So, just because we fucking can, DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD.</p>
<p>Imagine for a fucking second the past year and a half WITHOUT Netflix. WITHOUT Zoom. WITHOUT the internet. WITHOUT Amazon. WITHOUT DoorDash. WITHOUT 24/7 news. WITHOUT tracking apps. WITHOUT social media. WITHOUT video games. WITHOUT Spotify. WITHOUT YouTube. Imagine spending a year and a half of your life stuck inside, isolated from your friends and family, without any of that shit, and tell me you'd still do it. I fucking highly doubt it.</p></p>

        <p>I had the thought that if the internet goes down no one is putting up with this. I am telling my husband, that we need get a real life, not one seen through screens. I am even interested in intentional community or living in a co housing situation. I already pay 900 a month in rent almost, and I know some of those rent. I am tired of living a life in a box looking into boxes. I want some people in my real life even though I am older and disabled. This whole life style fucking sucks to me. I am disabled but not dead.  You are right this shit wouldn't have flown 10,20 years ago. People would have said screw it and gone to see whoever they wanted. There's no real community left, everyday I wake up and think why is there no family, why is there no place to see people I fucking KNOW? I even worry I have to start over again just to have a life, but this is not tenable, I don't like it.  Lots of people have no friends you know or just have friends online, that's me. There are some decent scientists speaking out, but most are toadies to the corporation. They spent their lives obeying. Maybe the nerds were assholes, I am a nerd but I am a freethinking one, no bennies and straight As for me, and having my butt kissed every second. Artists in this society are lower than dogfood, well art education was my vocation when young before disability.</p>

        <p>Also.. imagine 18 months without Government Benefits to support it all.</p>
<p>I'm for <em>emergency</em> and <em>temporary</em> benefits, but over 12 months after the emergency is over? People paid to be complacent while government takes power.</p>
<p>Without $$ and all the comforts/distractions you stated - this would NOT have gone on this long FOR SURE.</p>
<p>GREAT POINT.</p>
<p>PS. I think you need to make 2 posts. you make 2 points that are important, but they could be separated. Title doesn't reflect the content as best it could.</p>

        <p>More people need to realize this is true. Genuine debate is being stifled because those with money and power want a narrative they can control. If you're a scientist and they can't control you, you're out. It's not even a theory, you can watch the slander and censorship unfold in real time.</p>

        <p>The scientists involved with government aren't sociall inept. In fact I'd say that they're socially very skilled, probably like a psychopath is socially very skilled.</p>
