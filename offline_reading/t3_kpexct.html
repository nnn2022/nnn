        <p>Thats the hilarious irony...its actually WORSE than if you wore nothing at all considering 99.999999% of the population does not wear masks properly or the way Healthcare workers do. Do you really think doctors and nurses take masks off and on, touch things and then put their masks back on over and over and over, and toss them in their cars when not using them??? Its a cesspool of bacteria!!! Fucking morons!!!</p>

        <p>When people say something like that, I tell them "You do know that people have been smothered to death with a very thin pet blanket, right?" and they give me the 'surprised Pikachu' look.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that masks impinge on breathing. Full stop there. They also get very cruddy with bacteria and detritus from your breathing very quickly. Sorry: Not wearing them.</p>

        <p>It's not just a piece of cloth, it's a bacteria trap and people wearing it are breathing all that back in, bacterial pneumonia is very much a real thing and it's serious, only in a healthcare setting are medical masks to be worn and for short period of times... Masks aren't for the general public and for long periods of time... I can't believe that we're a year into this and this is still not common knowledge</p>

        <p>I knew we had reached full hysteria when they started demanding children as young as 3 wear them.</p>
<p>It doesn’t get anymore delusional than convincing yourself a pew-schooler can keep a mask sanitary.</p>

        <p>This article is a disaster. First it goes into danger of inhaled particles:</p>
<p>&rt;Scientists  first discovered microplastics in the lung tissue of some patients who  died of lung cancer in the 1990s, and many other studies have since  highlighted the potential damage to health caused by such materials.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Plastic  degrades slowly, so once in the lungs it tends to stay there and build  up in volume. Some studies have found that the immune system can attack  these foreign objects, causing prolonged inflammation that can lead to  diseases such as cancer.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The institute’s study also found that reused masks produced more loosened fibres</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;But  wearing an N95 for a long time could cause fatigue because of oxygen  shortage, it has been warned, and in many countries these masks were  reserved for use by frontline health workers.</p>
<p>Then claims the side effects are unclear:</p>
<p>&rt;The exact health side-effects caused by broken-off fibres is unclear, so  although people should be informed of the inhalation risk they should  continue to wear masks, the researchers said. </p>
<p>One paragraph later says masks are contributing to pollution:</p>
<p>&rt; Used masks have also added to litter and recent studies have warned of  their contribution to water pollution, potentially adding to consumption  of harmful plastics by humans and animals.</p>
