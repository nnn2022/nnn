    <strong>Issues with sense of touch feeling off/numb after getting first Pfizer shot?</strong>
    <p><p><em>this may be tl;dr so be warned if you don't want to read it all</em></p>
<p>I got the Pfizer shot on the 26th of April and about an hour afterwards, I noticed my chest felt warm right where my heart is and it felt like every time I took a breath, I was running a marathon. I brushed it off and went to sleep, with me hoping things would get better in the morning. However, things didn't get better. When I woke up I was experiencing severe cognitive Impairement and I  it seemed like my symptoms from my previous ailment where returning and we're intensified (I got off of Lamotrigine last October and had been experiencing cognitive effects).</p>
<p>This persisted for a couple of days before a new symptoms emerged. I started developing uncontrollable anger with no real source or trigger. This was accompanied by muscle spasms and twitches that I began developing during the nighttime. My whole body also felt warm, with my face especially felling as such. The anger went away after about a week and a half, but the uncontrollable shaking persisted and eventually developed into full body fasciculations that hasn't gone away since. Also, I developed tinnitus in both ears which has come and gone periodically.</p>
<p>My vision also changed during the first few weeks. I noticed things started to get blurry and eventually that subsided. My right eye though would start to see things darker than the other eye at random points and I noticed my motion tracking was much less capable.</p>
<p>Psychologically, I started to like certain things that I never had before, some of which were repulsive, but I couldn't stop myself from liking them. It was as if an impulse to think or like those things had overwritten my previous personality traits. My motor control has also declined to a large degree and it's hard to do regular things that I did before.</p>
<p>When all of this started I was vigilant enough to go and check out the r/covidvaccinated sub-reddit to see if anybody had any issues with the vaccine. My initial findings suggested that there were a good amount of complaints, some perhaps fake, some not, but a good amount of them seemed quite similar to what I was experiencing. I eventually reached out to some people and talked to them and we made some hypotheses about what could be causing these issues. Brain inflammation, the spike protein, hormone imbalances, were just some of the things we thought of.</p>
<p>At this time, I have yet to receive a definitive answer and was wondering if there were any medical practitioners or anybody well versed in immunology that could perhaps shed some light as to what's going on. I tried to post in the r/CovidVaccinated subreddit, but I didn't yield many answers and where left with more questions than I started out with. Not to mention the fact that they disabled the ability to post new threads and have since essentially halted the subreddit completely. I know posting here might get me banned on Reddit as a whole, but I have nowhere else to turn to.</p></p>

        <p>I think everybody has a right to know if this is truly as widespread as some claim it to be. There's going to be a non-zero chance that vaccines cause some sort of side effect and some of those times it might be something we don't know of yet. Science is about questioning things and seeking to understand the world through empirical evidence and it's not a cult. I'm just tired of people being censored because every little bit of information counts.</p>

        <p>their side effects literally scare the shit out of me. Cognitive impairment, impending blindness.</p>
<p>People don't realize how bad disability can get, it isn't just shuffling along with a cane or walker. It's suffering on multiple levels. It's ending up in the nursing home, or group home, it's being abandoned. It's poverty and being unable to work a job or function. When you lose the ability to care for yourself all bets are off. I wonder what is going to happen to a society full of people who are disabled to this level, and the mental stuff sounds like some are having the prions take early effect.</p>

        <p>I don't think it would be prions. If so, we would have definitely seen many more people affected on a much larger scale and it would be much more gruesome of a cognitive decline. It seems like people are saying they return back to normal after four months. It's only been two for me so I'm holding out hope for the future.</p>

        <p>Sure I guess but then again people die 3 months after taking it. We just don't know the long term effects of a rushed experimental injection that took less than a year to make and test when vaccines usually take a decade to be approved.</p>

        <p>Sounds about right. Brain inflammation and I've seen similar posts on that sub before I got banned there.
Welcome to the club, I'm sorry we didn't get to you soon enough friend. Keep us posted.</p>

        <p>Ivermectin is supposed to also be a powerful anti-inflammatory. I would look into trying to get a doctor to prescribe it to you.</p>
