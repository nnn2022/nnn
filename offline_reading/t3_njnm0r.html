        <p>She just didn’t want to hear any of my concerns over all of our this. I had NO idea the vaccine was out yet or anything and she was one of the first to get it (icu nurse)in December, Pfizer.  I began researching then and uncovering mRNA animal studies and noticed things weren’t as they seemed.</p>
<p>It may have been the denial or guilt for not telling me that led to this but she just seemed very hollow and off and just not as caring loving and empathetic to the concerns that I had.  For a few weeks we both thought I was just crazy</p>

        <p>Thank you for answering and giving a bit of insight to something very personal and obviously painful for you. I am sorry that you've had to deal with this and I hope that things work out for you and your wife.</p>
<p>Is there pressure from her for you to get vaxxed?</p>

        <p>Thank you. I don’t have any social media but have been on Reddit and other places trying to find out what’s going on for the last couple months.  I’ve been very outspoken on where I stand and even though seemingly everyone around me has been vaxxed I have not had too much pressure (yet) </p>
<p>On a side note my father had the vaccine and ended up in the hospital for 5 days because his skin was falling off.  He had a previous skin issue but had never been hospitalized.</p>
<p>My wife’s best friend who lives next door to us and we share a well also had the shot and got very sick. No one knew it could be related To the vaccine at this
Point and she proceeded to get a lawyer and threaten to sue us over “bad well water”. We took water tests and just had to wait for two weeks while she was convinced that we were poisoning her.  I have known this woman for ten years and this was way out of character. She wasn’t herself.  I dunno what’s in these vaccines but  I’m gonna stay away from GMO’S for a little while longer</p>

        <p>that’s too bad, hope all is even better soon. i’m not sure what you’re going through exactly but it’d be hard to look at them the same afterwards. not a reduction in respect but something similar. i’m not sure how to put it into words exactly.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I find it hard to actually connect with people here but you seem genuine. My wife is an icu nurse and got the shot In December before I really began looking into this. We were planning on having kids this year but I’m gonna wait a few more months(years?) to see how this all plays out.   So thankful I’m not a parent now though, I would be so much angrier</p>

Principal called to let her know there was no pressure it’s not required. She went anyway. Didn’t like the side effects. Her coworker had to go to the ER after dose 2.

        <p>My fiance and I made a pact together. That we wait 1 year to see how it plays out. And we would go together. (I didn't want to, but I loved her).  </p>
<p>Well, went and got it anyways without telling me. 
The way I found out was cause I had to go to the hospital cause my testicles hurt SUPER bad.
And at then E.R  she accidentally let it slip while talking to a nurse. I was so upset. But when it comes to relationship upset. I just cry ha. 
But instead of saying she's sorry she lied to me. 
She begins to humiliate me and mock me. 
While im laying in the hospital bed, with the possibility of emergency testicle surgery. She was so cruel about it. </p>
<p>Then she got the second shot. And shit hit the fan. 
She was soooo evil to me. Like, I had no idea she could be evil as this. She walked out on me when I was as work, she burned all my friendships and family connections. Got me fired from my job, then got me served a protection order.  She was a totally different person. Broke my heart. </p>
<p>Oh and after she got the vaccine. She had her period for over a month. Non-stop.</p>
<p>Buttttt here's the weird part. So my testicles started to hurt around the time she got vaccinated. We have sex 5-6 times a week. And it continued to hurt worse and worse.  And now we haven't had sex In about a month, my testicles stopped hurting. The internal bumps that where on them just kinda disappeared.</p>
<p>So yes, the vaccine ruined my relationship with a woman I thought I was going to marry.  😣</p>

        <p>Yes. The side effects were so bad she said she wished she hadn't gotten it.</p>
<p>My kid, who already had a poor work attendance record, missed work the day after her shot (at work, an "essential" business that got shots for its employees early). She was let go the next day for poor attendance.</p>

        <p>My husband wants to get J&amp;J but I keep asking him to please wait until at least Phase 3 trials are done, which it looks like it will be during flu season this year for JJ, Pfizer April 6 2023. I don't want him to get any but I do agree it is his body, his choice. It is just hard to fully accept that.</p>
<p>So far, sheer laziness has kept him home (wfh), but I'm so worried. I want to have another baby but what if this thing sterilizes him or cause weird birth defects? We had a stillborn last Nov... I don't think I can mentally handle losing another baby.</p>

<p>No, not really. He could stand to drop 20lbs since he has a sedentary desk job, but otherwise normal. He just believes that the data looks good, even when I point out that the trials aren't done and so many adverse reactions are being posted everywhere. He has come to an opposing conclusion. :(</p>

        <p>Hopefully he’ll be okay. Seams nonsensical to get a questionable vax for a bad cold he’d probably handle well but I guess others don’t see it that way.</p>

        <p>He might be edging my way little by little. He used to shut down completely when I disagreed but now we've started joking slightly. I will keep hoping and trying to sway him.</p>
