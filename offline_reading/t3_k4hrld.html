    <strong>Tell them.</strong>
    <p><p>Tell them, that in 2020 we've convinced ourselves that up is down and down is up. What was normal is now abnormal, what was abnormal is now normal. </p>
<p>Before 2020, we didn't panic or really think about the fact that dozens of people died every day of respiratory infections in long term care facilities across Canada. </p>
<p>Before 2020, we accepted that every day across Canada thousands of people came down with a cold or flu. Missed work or school, or took a bunch of meds and powered through. </p>
<p>Before 2020, we knew that emergency rooms and hospitals were usually full or close to full. My grandmother had to sleep in a hallway for a night when she was admitted a few years ago, waiting for a room to open up. This was common. </p>
<p>Now we ask millions of service workers to wear masks 40 hours a week, for what used to be normal amounts of illness and death. </p>
<p>Now we let government shut down our businesses, restrict our gatherings, and close our borders, for what used to be normal amounts of illness and death. </p>
<p>Now we're hurting our children's education and future prospects, going into mountains of debt, and creating an epidemic of depression and anxiety, for what used to be normal. </p>
<p>This is not normal. Tell them it's not normal.</p></p>

        <p>You know, this made me realize something:</p>
<p>2020 is the age kids born post 9/11 reached adulthood. They have never known a world that wasn't full of nanny state, zero tolerance bullshit. I think we are reaping what our parents sewed :\</p>
<p>Beyond that, and I need to update, but:</p>

<p>We have had FEWER DEATHS IN 2020 THAN 2019 AND 2018 IN CANADA , AND FEWER THAN 2017 AS WELL IN ONTARIO</p>

        <p>Totally agree with this. I was 8 when 9/11 happened. I remember meeting my mother at the airport gate to welcome her back from vacation. That could never happen today. I can't imagine the feelings for younger people where the NYS SAFE Act and PATRIOT Act have always been a part of their lives and never 'new'.</p>

        <p>Sow, not sew.</p>
<p>Sew = stitch things together with thread.</p>
<p>Sow = plant, particularly crops.</p>
<p>The metaphor youâ€™re using is that you harvest (reap) what you plant (sow).</p>
