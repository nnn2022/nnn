    <strong>[Some good news/some bad/rant] Finally compromise with teachers</strong>
    <p><p>Some good news: Teachers will sometimes accommodate so I can read lips. Some bad news: Teachers won't always accommodate. Sometimes the mask is clear, other times it's black. Still no normal.</p>
<p>After I filed a complaint to my college my teachers said they would start to wear a mask with a window so I could read lips during language classes. I'm hearing with autism, but can't understand people when wearing mask and relies on visual cues. I can't hear what they're saying without seeing.</p>
<p>But my teachers won't wear clear masks when I've linguistic and history classes. So, now I would've to rely on one of my deaf classmates interpreter. Sign language is actually my 3rd language that I've begun learning a month ago, while Norwegian is my 1st and English my 2and language. I can't understand my 1st and 2and language when people wears masks. So, when I've to rely on a 3rd language combined with reading PowerPoint it says a lot.</p>
<p>So, I deals with a lot now because of not everyone are ready to go back to normal and some insists on the mask wearing.</p></p>
