    <strong>Love you guys</strong>
    <p><p>Writing this quickly as I'm heading to bed. NNN brothers and sisters, don't be fooled by the ruling class and their game. This slow reopening of our country is only temporary. They're purposely giving people the taste of freedom so they miss it even more when they inevitably snatch it again. Maybe it won't be next week, or even next year, but the time will come. And when that time comes, Biblical prophesy will come to fruition along with it. I urge everyone to read 'Christ is Fullness of Life,' which contains the writings of Saint Porphyrios of the Orthodoxy religion. He eloquently explains how our love for Christ trumps all the fear and wrongdoings we may encounter on Earth. And while the wrongdoings are coming, there's nothing to fear as they were written and meant to be fulfilled. With Christ on our side, no wrong can be done to us that won't be repaid 10-fold. Live like Him! Love your neighbor. Pray for those that wish harm upon you. Don't hate but have pity for those whose minds have been lost. Pray that they see salvation. It's not easy to do, yet Christ did it out of His love for you and I. Repay the favor and life will just click for you. </p>
<p>There may not be many of us, but as Matthew 7 says, </p>
<p>&rt; Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.</p>
<p>We're right where were supposed to be</p></p>

        <p>As a Christian who will soon be Eastern Orthodox, this warms my heart. :-)</p>
<p>Regarding the comments section, I am sorry you’re on the receiving end of so much hate from those unbelievers who are triggered by even the mention of God. Just know that it’s a good sign that people who follow the devil’s ways react so violently to Him—it is, after all, what we were told would happen. </p>
<p>John 15:18-26
“If the world hate you, know ye, that it hath hated me before you.
If you had been of the world, the world would love its own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.
Remember my word that I said to you: The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you: if they have kept my word, they will keep yours also.
But all these things they will do to you for my name's sake: because they know not him who sent me.
If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.
If I had not done among them the works that no other man hath done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.
But that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law: They hated me without cause.
But when the Paraclete cometh, whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall give testimony of me.”</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing this.. It took me a long time to realize that any pain/suffering endured on Earth is just a drop in the bucket compared to an eternity in paradise. Coming to grips with that makes life a breeze. If you haven't seen the movie 'Silence' by Martin Scorsese, I highly recommend giving it a watch to see John 15 in practice. </p>
<p>I'm also happy to see people come across Orthodoxy.. There's something about sitting there in church being surrounded by those beautiful icons that makes for great reflection... Even when you dont always know what's being said lol.</p>
<p>I have learned after attending many different types of churches over the years that sometimes a personal relationship with God trumps physical places of worship. It's almost Christianity's best kept secret (and it's purposely made as so IMO). Any one person can shut their eyes and pray and form a relationship with God, regardless of creed, sex, orientation, etc. and not many people know that.</p>

        <p>Its hard to divorce why i personally feel so strongly about this vaccine hurting people, especially the younger people because of my christian faith. I hope others who share the concern of these vaccines and overreach of authority with OP but who many not share our reasons of faith, respect those that do. Im clearly looking at the scientific reasons why this should have been halted in early Jan, but many of us are driven by science AND our faith.</p>

        <p>100%. I'm not Orthodox, just a simple nondenominational Christian, and this is 100% good vs evil going on when you boil it down. It's hard to get people to see if they are not willing to be open to it. It's similar to this group wishing others would realize all the corruption going on related to this pandemic. You speak truth. May others hear with an open mind.</p>

        <p>It’s the last red pill that even many people on the team just can’t accept- that this all boils down to a war against demons. All the evidence is filleted out for all to see, but the level of hypnosis is so deep, and has gone on since birth. Organized religion is another cloak and tool the evil use to hypnotize us. When I woke up to this, I see it everywhere now. Little drops of poison planted in everything that God is a lie, that believing in God is akin to some kind of mental deficiency. There’s a reason rioters are allowed to continue, but church-goers were arrested for singing hymns outside. There’s a reason MS-13 demons are allowed to run rampant across our country. There’s a reason white Christians are being painted as terrorists, while POC perpetrating real crimes against whites and Asians aren’t even whispered about on MSM. And I am <em>not racist</em>. I do not blanket cloak all POC- most of them see it, there are more on our team than anyone knows, and when the truth comes out, this is what will absolutely blow the minds of the left. Gay and trans people, too. I have a trans cousin that’s on our team, and she’s in her 70’s.</p>
<p>I was born and raised a Christian Scientist, then fell out of it as an adult, and I felt about God the exact same way that angry user in these comments felt. But when I see all the evidence put together- <em>real evidence</em>- their hand symbols, their upside-down crosses, their ceremonies they work into their performances, their words, their pedophilia, their gender bending... Shit, even a crash-course in freemasonry proves it: they’re satanists. The way they divide us and tell us to hate each other, instead of teaching love, acceptance. The way they pissed on those in real need during this pandemic and gave money to their special interests. When I see how hard they work to silence the voices of those trying to get the truth of what’s happening out, and MSM’s refusal to report the real facts, of not just Covid, but what’s happening in the streets. The dismantling and shame of the nuclear family. How they amplify the voices of the insane few like it’s the norm. The numbers of children that go missing every single day around the planet. I’ve seen photos and videos of their depravity, and it wakes me in the night. I’ve also been attacked by demons, once physically, several times mentally, and they were the most terrifying things I’ve ever experienced, and have created some PTSD I’m still working through.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t even like the word “God” anymore, because they’ve completely weaponized it, seeded a repulsion at the mere mention of it. But what’s funny, and I know others as well that felt like me, is their agenda has actually drove us back into the arms of the Creator, the Universal Mind, Love. I see the Bible completely different now, because you only need two brain cells to rub together to see that what was written is actually playing out on the world stage right now. There was a point I would have thrown the Bible on a fire, but now I see that it’s prophesy, no different than the words of Nostradamus. My best friend has been a little slower coming to this realization than me, and the best way I was able to describe it to her was how much we hated DT until we saw the truth, saw how they implanted that hate, and the same applies with Universal Love. They want us to hate each other, they want to destroy families, they want to destroy everything good and holy, they are allowing demons to destroy our businesses and homes, they shove fear fear fear down our throats 24/7. In a true and honest world, they would be saying “these vaccines are experimental, and honestly you don’t even need them unless you’re of a certain age or immuno-compromised. There is a lot of risk as this is new technology, and there are way less-invasive methods to treat Covid, but we know many of you wanted a vax, so here it is- take it at your own risk as we’re not liable for injury or death.” But that’s not what we hear. People need to ask why.</p>
<p>Sorry this turned into a wall, but I think this is an important discussion.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the response. You're absolutely right that life boils down to good and evil. The Illuminati (aka the 13 blood lines) serve one purpose and one purpose only: to serve Satan. From the rituals to the blatant symbolism you've mentioned, it's undeniable.   These same Satan worshipers control every  facet of our lives which is why Christ and any form of light in general is blotted out whenever possible. </p>
<p>Have you noticed the recent push to make Satanism trendy amongst younger generations? It's become a pathetic attempt to normalize and downplay the true motives and religion of the Elite. </p>
<p>&rt; I honestly don’t even like the word “God” anymore, because they’ve completely weaponized it</p>
<p>The reason you no longer like the word anymore is because the "God" you've been accustomed to hearing is actually just referring to Satan. The Pledge of Allegiance, the 'In God We Trust' on your dollar bill, they all refer to the <em>their</em> god (Satan). If you ever come across a Free Mason license plate you'll see 'In God We Trust' plastered across the plate. I assure you it isn't the God of the Bible.</p>
<p>In regards to the vaccine, we live in a society where bribery is a legal practice (lobbying). In the last decade, the pharmaceutical industry has stuffed hundreds of millions of dollars into the pockets of politicians. Nothing in life is organic when that is a legal and regularly occurring practice. And as 1 Timothy points out, money is the root of all evil.</p>

        <p>I think there’s a little room for inspiring words- you know how to scroll past posts you don’t like. Let’s not eat our own like the left is doing, we’re better than that. We need all kinds to make a team. Unless you’re a troll, I didn’t bother checking.</p>

        <p>Excuse me? The post is off topic. Again, this is a site for discussion of the Covid-19 "pandemic" and its impact on society, not a church or a theological seminary. If you want to preach, go elsewhere. There are literally dozens of subs where you can thump your bible and act like a religious freak. Please don't do that here.</p>
