    <strong>Banned from r/covidvaccinated for spreading misinformation because I asked a question</strong>
    <p><p>Some background: I've been subscribed to r/covidvaccinated because I'm curious about the vaccines. I wanted to read experiences people have had since I know people personally who have got the vaccine and have had side effects. I'm also not totally opposed to taking the vaccine I just don't trust the media reporting on it and I don't plan on taking it any time soon.</p>
<p><strong>Here is the post:</strong></p>
<p>I know this is a "duh" post but I know those who were wondering if you'd test positive and how soon you'd test positive after being vaccinated. My doctor didn't even want to order the test for me because he said it wouldn't show up yet but I requested it anyway. For those interested in the timeline:</p>
<p>-Got my second dose on February 3rd</p>
<p>-Tested positive for antibodies on February 18th</p>
<p>https://old.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/lnna5w/tested_positive_for_antibodies_2_weeks_after_my/</p>
<p><strong>And my comment:</strong></p>
<p>Have you had any antibody tests before February 3rd? Otherwise how do you know you didn't have antibodies before the vaccine?</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>I believe the original post is an example of misinformation. The essentially did an experiment with the vaccine and reported on it. In terms of the scientific method their question was whether or not they would have an antibodies after two weeks. The hypothesis is that they would. The experiment they did was to take a vaccine and wait two weeks and test to see if they had antibodies. However, there was no control in the experiment. They didn't check beforehand if they already had the antibodies or at least didn't say they did. So I asked because without that crucial piece of information, their report is worthless.</p>
<p>This is a clear example of The Science but not science. This experiment would receive and "F" in any science class. And it's pretty pathetic to not allow people to ask questions. Can anyone point to the misinformation or conspiracy theory in my questions?</p></p>

        <p>You made such an extremely valid point, but if I already had both vaccines, I probably wouldn't want to hear it either. Someone yesterday told me that the nurse at her work explains to everyone that the mRNA are dead virus particles. I said GIRL, no they ain't. I even double checked what she got and she said Moderna. I'm not even a damn nurse anymore. I'm just trying not to be ignorant about something the whole world is pushing. She just looked at me blankly. I wonder how she felt when I told her the vaccine is only good for three months and she'll need boosters. I don't know because she just sat thereü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
