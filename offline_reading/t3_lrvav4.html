    <strong>something big is coming</strong>
    <p><p>i can feel it</p>
<p>the elites know the game is up, take a look at r/conspiracy every single thing i talked about and exposed is being snowballed into greater and bigger leads. </p>
<p>we have won</p>
<p>but the question is what is there next move?</p>
<p>they have two options, </p>
<p>they end the lockdown and try to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, orrrrrrrrr, they start coming into our homes and taking our kids for "unsafe parenting" and try to force vaccines.</p>
<p>if its option number two then i see all out war, the masses will fight back and destroy the system </p>
<p>or if option number 1, then im really scared and worried.</p>
<p>i have been viewing a couple of friends instagram posts from the past couple of days and ive seen people buying tickets to live events and shows? are we really just going to move on???</p>
<p>are the sheep really going to just forget that this all started out as "2 weeks" to flatten the curve and we had a year of our life taken from us. </p>
<p>what do we do here? what is the action?</p>
<p>with the deep pedo state exposed and more vulnerable than ever, when do we decide to take action?</p>
<p>when do we liberate?</p>
<p>when do we demand justice?</p>
<p>we cannot let this go back to normal with no justice. </p>
<p>i can see it happening, people will just give up, they will start tossing incentives, new adverts will come out. "if you want to have fun again, make sure to get you dna altering vaccine from top dog mr gates!" and everybody will rush for it. people just want to go back to normal and i get it, we all do but we cant just accept defeat. we cant just, bow down. im so scared for whats to come. </p>
<p>we need to play our cards perfectly. </p>
<p>we cannot forgive or forget anything. </p>
<p>the world is waking up, i can assure you.</p>
<p>people in my town are active in the streets, parks, massless and happy. the birds chirp, the sun shines and its like this nightmare never existed.</p>
<p>but i need to re iterate, we cannot just bow down, they can and they will use thier tools (msm, news, social media etc) to manipulate and incentivise vaccines.</p>
<p>its even in the realm of possibility that selfish celebrities will endorse the vaccines too just so they can profit from shows and events etc etc if that is understandable.</p>
<p>in this day and age, the youth is obsessed with fame and "clout" and its a complete and utter matrix in itself. i have alot of thinking to do. </p>
<p>ill be back soon</p>

        <p>Is my expeculation, but when pressure arrives(covid passports, no jab no job) I think at least 70% of people will take the vaccine. Maybe more</p>

        <p>Oh, I’ll keep pushing this nutshack so people learn from the opportunity. It may be one year for most, but for me I‘ve been holding these opinions for 8 years. Of course, no one wanted to hear my crap when I questioned why people took racial justice and gender studies deadly seriously because of what the news tells them, or why they only look at politics as a faction war, and why everyone ignores terrible crises, and they just wanted me to shut up. I regret leaving them be now, countless people suffered for our compliance, and that’s blood on our hands, whether most people want to accept that or not.</p>
<p>Someone might see me say that, slide in, and bitch about “reparations”, no, screw that. We’re in enough of a hole as it is, I just want people to learn from history so they learn to recognize problems when they arise, not after everything is said and done, otherwise the <em>next</em> pandemic or whatever excuse they find next could absolutely ruin us.</p>

        <p>Wow you’re right. All those comments are weirdly similar.</p>
<p>Good though. I hope the average person is finally questioning what the fuck has been going on.</p>

        <p>The really worrying thing is that even if option 2 occurs, I don't think the sheep will do anything. Something is seriously wrong with the majority of people at the minute and it's really fucking scary.</p>

        <p>Why would they ease off now? They haven't crushed the spirit of man yet. They gotta get everybody ready for 2030. Plus some small businesses have survived. Can't have any of those.</p>
