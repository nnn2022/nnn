        <p>Bitcoin was just a way to get people familiar with cryptocurrency. The romantic story of Satoshi was part of it. It is no coincidence that the Winklevoss twins became very rich from it. (Harvard)</p>
<p>Yes, Bitcoin was and is a great way to make money. Keep in mind the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's a way of getting rid of fiat. They want you to 'invest' all of your fiat money into this, so that when there comes an 'internet blackout' or 'cyber pandemic', both the cryptomarkets (and the coins) and lots of fiat money will be vanished. (Yes, some of you might still have coins on your wallet. The question then is if the coins can still be used.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't wait for a coin to hit the 100k or even more. By that time nobody is going to 'invest' in coins anymore, which makes it difficult to get cash for your coins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are some whales out there who have a large part of all the (bit)coins. I believe it even was 80%, but I'm not sure about this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I suspect that there will be a 'cyber pandemic' in the near future. The World Economic Forum is openly discussing this event. If it's the case, and if my 'theory' above is correct, it means the vanishing of both a lot of fiat and cryptocurrency.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The 'solution'? Human bodies as miners of cryptocurrency. You're carrying your own coins inside your body. They'll sell it as 'safe' and more bulletproof against a new 'cyber threat'.</p>

        <p>Brilliant post mate. Saved. Klaus Schwab has warned of a cyber attack, and what better way than to get everyone to buy crypto and then wipe out the exchanges and rob people's wallets. Again, great post and I am going to think about this one. I learn alot from people across all of the board.</p>

        <p>You could even say films like V for Vendetta and years and years (tv show). Get people used to the idea of a dystopia.</p>

        <p>The FED has been dollarising the world for the last year. When they say 'extend dollar swap lines' it means that central banks have more dollars so when there is a dollar crisis, there will be a world currency crisis. Then comes your digital dollar, digital pound - all stored in your Bank of England/Fed app. I am going to be topping up on precious metals over the next few months.</p>
