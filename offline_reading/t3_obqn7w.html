    <strong>What is our end game?</strong>
    <p><p>I know everybody must have considered this, but what really do we do when work says get the jab or youre sacked.. we can start talking about our human rights and try and take them to court but realisticly we'll fail. Then what? get sacked.. go on the doll because how are you meant to get a new job when your last employer tells them you were sacked for being unvaccinated and you still aren't? then how are you supposed to pay your rent/mortgage? they might even deny benefits to unvaxed when we are the 5% minority. </p>
<p>The only way we are going to have any kind of voice and not get picked off 1 by 1 is by uniting together and doing something, but what? and its not easy to unite together since they are censoring our avenues, it wont be long until the brainwashed vaccine fanatics get this subreddit closed. </p>
<p>My last resort was to fuck off to another country (I'm that serious about not getting it) but how am I supposed to get into another country and get a working visa? even if its a country without strict vaccine rules.</p>
<p>I see grim times in the next 12 months.. sorry if I put yall in a bad mood I just want to plan ahead</p></p>

        <p>Not sure what country/state you are in but I am back in the office and no one is wearing masks including the CEO.</p>
<p>IF this employer wanted to let me go for not being vaxxed that would be pretty funny - took me 10 days to get a new job last time I tried. </p>
<p>Companies here can barely find people to fill the jobs they have - until that changes the scenario you are talking about just isnt going to happen except at perhaps the most woke companies.</p>

        <p>This is the next battle to fight, and the same way we will lose is if people comply.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if something is legal or not, or goes against your human rights, if the majority simply gives consent to such through mass compliance.</p>
<p>That's how it works. The Devil is not going to remind you of your Free Will, because he is bound to it, so will instead get you to comply or undermine yourself to get you to consent to the contract.</p>

        <p>I'm in England as well mate.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if there is anywhere to run to at this point. Maybe certain states in the US?</p>
<p>There's loads of protests in London, people are pushing back as they can.bpeacrul protest and non-compliance seems the way to go for now.</p>
<p>When winter hits again, the mRNA vaccinated will start dying off in droves, a new strain will be blamed, and as an unvaccinated - the narrative will be increasingly be spun against us.</p>
<p>What to do? Do not submit, do not comply, do what good/right that you can, and be willing to die before submitting.</p>
<p>A way often shows itself, but a bit of faith can sometimes be needed. Do the right thing as much as possible, and ofc bear in mind practical considerations.</p>
<p>It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better. especially in a few months time.</p>
<p>All the best</p>

        <p>Mass Noncompliance is the only way to go. You can run from it but the problem will just beat you there. Eventually, they'll force you to stand for what you believe in, and you'll either fold or it'll cost you everything. What happens will depend on what you're made of, and if they want to push the issue.</p>
<p>Plus, your employer has no right to violate HIPPA, so there's that...</p>

        <p>HIPPA isn't constitution afaik, but it does pertain to one's right to privacy, which I understand you may not have under the crown. </p>
<p>I'm going to warn you now, because your government has a stranglehold on your healthcare there, it is very likely that you will be denied healthcare access if you refuse to get the fauci ouchie. I imagine it may already be happening.</p>

        <p>I don’t think running to another country will work. I am living in SE Asia and it’s getting very draconian, compulsory testing then shipped of to a facility if you’re positive. I want to get back to the west but it’s not straightforward for me to just leave. Need a new plan. Are there any anti whatever this is country’s? I think this is world wide. Kinda sounding biblical atm tbh.</p>

<p>speak for yourself. my work said that wed need to be vaccinated to return to the office. i said i wouldnt be willing to do that, and the requirement was lifted.</p>
<p>the vaccine only lasts 6 months. its not like these people are permanently vaccinated. my work is not allowed to ask for my medical records.</p>

        <p>This is something I wrote in response to someone else, but I thought you would find it informative, too:</p>
<p>The reason for all of this trickery on the part of the elites is <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">the Great Reset</a>. Broadly speaking, the Great Reset is a plan involving remaking the world’s economic and political systems on the basis that what we have now doesn’t work. There are many components of the Great Reset, lbut the core theme of it is sustainability in the form of “carbon neutrality,” as they put it.</p>
<p>That sounds good on the surface, even if they are taking advantage of the pandemic as <a href="https://www.weforum.org/focus/the-great-reset">“a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world.”</a> As the saying goes, though, the devil is in the details—besides <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles">phasing out fossil fuels</a>, they will be <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9501565/How-Bidens-climate-plan-affect-everyday-Americans.html">cutting red meat consumption to just 4lbs per year (a 90% reduction)</a>, forcing people to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2021/04/04/home-radiators-will-have-ten-degrees-cooler-britain-reach-net/">turn their heaters 10 degrees Celsius cooler</a>, <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/299414/REP_Absolute_Zero_V3_20200505.pdf?sequence=9&amp;isAllowed=y">stopping shipping and air travel completely</a>, and many other things besides. Most ominous is the WEF’s vision for 2030, which involves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBBxWtKKQiA">people “owning nothing” yet being “happy.”</a></p>
<p>The first of two major methods they are using to begin is process is COVID vaccination, which they are using to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/05/15/vaccine-passports-covid-19-vaccine-verification-coming/7130642002/">introduce vaccine passports</a>, the first of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/nyregion/excelsior-pass-vaccine.html">having already been rolled out in New York (the Excelsior pass)</a>, to which it is conspicuously easy to attach a digital wallet. And this will likely be the next step, given the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/benefits-cashless-society-mobile-payments/">WEF’s open support of a cashless society.</a> It does not really need spelling out (but I will do so anyway) that the reason for this is to remove physical money from the equation in order to establish control; it is all well and good if you have money, but if you can’t use it because it’s all in the cloud and you’ve engaged in too many “dissident” activities,  then it doesn’t matter if you’re a broke college student or a multimillionaire—you’re still not going to be able to feed yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://thecanadianreport.ca/is-this-leaked-memo-really-trudeaus-covid-plan-for-2021-you-decide/">The prevailing theory regarding taking away everyone’s property and possessions (or their ownership of them, at first) is that there will be a debt forgiveness program</a> (note: while I don’t know how true it is that that link is an actual leak, I am providing it because it makes logical sense, and shows I am not just making up my own theories on this). Once the economy has crashes, the government will say something like “we know the economy is terrible and you don’t have a job, the money to pay your debts, or the means to put food on the table; but if you join our debt forgiveness program, it’ll all go away, and you’ll receive a UBI payment, too.” But in order to join the program, you’ll have to be vaccinated and give up ownership of all your possessions. This would include money (after all, money is used to buy possessions).</p>
<p>The second way is through the budding cyber pandemic, which <a href="https://youtu.be/0DKRvS-C04o">Klaus Schwab himself said will make COVID look like a minor inconvenience, and will involve a grid-down scenario.</a> Indeed, there have already been <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-fireeye-breached-after-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack/">attacks on SolarWinds and FireEye</a>. Most troublingly, FireEye’s offensive toolkit, one of the best in the world and normally used to test defensive software for large corporations and the government, was stolen in the hack. This was preceded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210531124228/https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/02/investigative-reports/from-event-201-to-cyber-polygon-the-wefs-simulation-of-a-coming-cyber-pandemic/">Cyber Polygon 2020, which conspicuously was planning for that exact type of hack, reminiscent of how Event 201 preceded the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic by just a few weeks</a>, and will shortly be followed by <a href="https://cyberpolygon.com">Cyber Polygon 2021 on July 9th</a>.</p>
<p>They will use this second line of offense to justify the creation of a new system, since the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, along with the shipping container and crop shortages (and other artificial agricultural vulnerabilities), will trigger a depression worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s and prove to the people that the current system doesn’t work.</p>
<p>That said, this isn’t even half of what is going on here, so I highly encourage you to look into it yourself.</p>

        <p>who cares if they force me to take the jab?
if i lose my job, who cares?
one thing is clear: that nobody cares if u die or get extremely sick. nobody</p>
<p>so, back to the roots I guess. cant pay bills? be homeless. go steal food. whatever your human instinct says. 
the spanish flu ended aswell. nobody wore masks, nobody got the vaccine after. 
literally was forgotten after the financial crisis and world war. so covid will be forgotten.</p>
<p>the first prison to escape, is your own mind. 
I dont need to survive a few extra days i the warm, dry. If the jab is gonna kill me sooner or later.
If I can go through a hard time, but extend my life significantly, this is what I would consider, would be much better.</p>

        <p>I can only speak for myself, each person makes their own choices. I retired due to the covid insanity of my last employer. My plan is to ride it out on my savings until the insanity ends, or my money does. If my money runs out first &amp; I can't afford my bills, I'll take my woodscraft knowledge &amp; fuck off to to the wilds where they won't bother to search for just one old man that refuses Fauci's ouchy &amp; the rest of the clown show. Yes, I'll likely die there of one thing or another, no Doctors where the cel phones can't go. But, for the first time in my life, I will be free. </p>
<p>I'd go now, but I admit I'm a little addicted to warm showers, comfy bed, bought food, &amp; electrical devices. When that addiction is unavailable anyway, I lose the last chains to this 'society'.</p>
