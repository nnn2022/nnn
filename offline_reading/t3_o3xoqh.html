    <p><p><a href="https://www.edhat.com/comment/173516#comment-173516">Sooo....  Of the three deaths reported in the last week - One was from the week of  June 6, one from May 30, and the second one reported two days ago was  from the week of December 13th.  The one death reported on June 10, was  from the week of January 31.  Having a hard time with the urgency to  administer an experimental gene therapy to twelve year olds, you know,  given all the side effects - blood clots, seizures, strokes, heart  attacks, etc.   Maybe when the clinical trials are over, around 2023,  and some long term studies have been done, will people feel more  comfortable.  I don't think the Disneyland, donut, lottery method is  convincing anyone.  When more and more people understand that these  'vaccines' have not been approved by the FDA, they have been approved  for "Emergency Authorization Use" only, that the people taking them ARE  the clinical trials, that the 'vaccine' manufactures have zero liability  if you are injured, that your insurance company will pay for the  diagnostic side if you are injured (blood clots, stroke, seizures, coma,  etc.) all the rest is on you.  If you have side effects, YOU are  responsible for the cost.  The employer/university that 'required it' is  not responsible.  You are.</a><a href="https://www.edhat.com/comment/173516#comment-173516"> So far, according to VAERS, there have been close to 6,000 deaths (in  the US - 10,000 in Europe) in relation to the 'vaccines' and according  to the CDC's own study in 2016, the VEARS represents only about 10% of  the actual count.  So you do the math.  The Swine Flu 'vaccine' was  halted (with zero actual cases) after about 500 paralyzations and 53  deaths.  We're now talking about 6,000 deaths, possibly multiplied by  10, and you want to start 12 year olds getting it?</a><a href="https://www.edhat.com/comment/173516#comment-173516"> When the top physicians, virologists, vaccine researchers, Nobel Peace  prize awardees are all shut down by MSM, Twitter, Youtube, Facebook -  you have to question what the hell is going on.  Look up Dr. Peter  McCullough,  Dr. Michael Yeadon, - Pfizer's former Vice President and  head vaccine researcher,  Luc Montagnier,  Kary Mullis - the inventor of  the PCR test, and a hundred more.   They are all screaming into the  wind.  This needs to stop.</a></p></p>

        <p>This is not  "I got kicked out of r/ whatever", this was the last bastion of our local communication.  They've DELETED the comment two times so far, and those that chose to support it.  They're left the anonymous shill comments, though.</p>
