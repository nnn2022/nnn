    <strong>I've done it !!! First day of shopping without a mask !!!</strong>
    <p><p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jejc6e/in_a_world_full_of_betas_be_an_alpha/">this post</a>, I coaxed and cajolled myself, then did my shopping at my local supermarket without wearing a mask.</p>
<p>A week ago I couldn't have imagined doing this, being an introvert person with an acute aversion to confrontations. I thank this sub for making this happen.</p>
<p>Admittedly, we live in a nice area and the supermarket is considered upmarket. I won't try this in a rough area full of chavs just yet - not until I've had more practice.</p>
<p>If I can do it, so can you.</p>
<p>PS. I'm in the UK.</p></p>

        <p>Well done!!</p>
<p>That we even have to congratulate someone for not slapping a mask on their face is all sorts of wrong. But seriously, well done. I know how uncomfortable it can be to do that.</p>
<p>I’ve made it a goal to make eye contact with everyone I see. I’ve noticed, people that wear masks don’t often make eye contact. But sadly, those not wearing masks, they make eye contact, but don’t react to that eye contact. I don’t know why that is. I want to smile and nod, but nah. I get nothing.</p>

        <p>I only wear a mask when absolutely necessary - like changing my phone plan. Oftentimes, shopping puts me in a bad mood now, so I'm not super friendly and I don't make eye contact with anybody. I've had a lot of comments made about me in passing when I'm shopping, and I feel like people are more confrontational where I live. I'm just trying to get in and out. I am starting to recognize other non-mask wearers where I live, because there are so few of us (Although, oddly enough, not many people wear masks to a lot of restaurants/bars). Every now and again, when the mask-wearing is almost 100%, I'll make eye contact with another non-mask wearer, and it feels like a life preserver.</p>

        <p>I dunno, a few times I've been on the tube (I never wear a mask) and there are other people not wearing one, and we all sit together.  Had a group of 5 of us the other day on the central line.  We weren't talking (I mean come on, it's still London), but I definitely think there was some solidarity there.  It's a lot easier when you aren't the only one not wearing one, unfortunately I often am though.  That's why it is so important that if you disagree with wearing one, you act on it.  Don't go along with it for an 'easy ride'.  There are probably loads of people just like you who will take it off if they see others not wearing one and it gives them the courage.  I literally have had no confrontation anywhere besides McDonald's, who were super militant about it but even they backed down immediately after I said I was exempt.  Once some busybody at a train station tried to say something to me but I literally just completely blanked him and carried on walking.  They can't do anything to you legally, not even the police, they can't issue a fine because you have no legal obligation to give them any of your details or say anything to them and they can't arrest you for just not wearing a mask.  If you just carry on walking, they can't even stop you, they certainly can't touch you.  So get some courage.</p>
<p>The only time I've worn a mask (well, actually I wore a scarf) this year was when I needed to take an emergency Uber somewhere, and I also feel that is a bit different because it is someone's private vehicle rather than a public area, and if they would rather I wear one then I don't mind accommodating them.  I asked the driver if he cared if I took my scarf off and he said he'd rather I kept it on, so I did.</p>

        <p>That's the fucking sad part too. Going into a store without something on your face shouldn't be anxiety inducing, yet my first few times, I had so many butterflies in my stomach. </p>
<p>Honestly I'm still nervous doing it in most stores so for now I've settled for wearing it under my nose. But for some stores in my area like corner stores, and the Family Dollar where even some of the staff don't wear them, I'll go maskless. It seems easier in my experience to do it in smaller stores than bigger ones.</p>

        <p>I've done it so many times in HEB (grocery store) I don't get nervous anymore. But when I go to places I visit less frequently, like Home Depot, there's always a non-zero chance I'll be confronted.</p>

        <p>Well done man the best way to resist this scam is to simply not comply, it's strange I'm in the UK and I have not worn a mask once and I have not been questioned or told to wear a mask by anyone not a customer or a employee no one has said anything to me. I think were quite lucky in the UK that people are quite naturally non conforntational and mind their own business, much diffrent to the US where the whole shop starts screaming and literally attacking people for not wearing masks. Fucking sheeps man we have to resist</p>

        <p>Not all places are like that. The outliers are televised and made to appear more prevalent. Like the media warping perception of covid risks. </p>
<p>Agree with you that the best way to resist this scam is non compliance. I've done this a few times. I'll do my part by doing this more!</p>

        <p>Where I live pretty much every business has the signs up. I've only had one place ask me to leave. They put the signs up to keep the health department off their back. My favorite restaurant even made a post on Facebook saying the sign would be up but feel free to ignore it if you chose.</p>
<p>Some places may be serious about it. You will find out once you go in. Worst case you turn around and leave.</p>

        <p>Not long ago(in Chicago area mind you), I did a test of taking off my mask slightly before I left a mall(near an exit, and as I was leaving), and noone said a thing lol. And as I was starting to overheat, wearing that damn thing.</p>
<p>Also with how anal and hostile some businesses are to nonmasked people, I'm still too reluctant to try going unmasked at any businesses. I have ran into a few businesses(even within city of Chicago) that had signage posted that if you only had like a bandana, that's good enough for entering. Also not long ago at one business, they were nice enough to one customer to provide him a complementary free mask(he couldn't find his own) for entering. It's interesting at some businesses, they do charge a small fee(like $1 at AMC theaters, and at one business I saw them have a sign about a $2 fee) to give you a mask. I wish this mask stuff would end, but am not holding my breath it will anytime soon.</p>

        <p>I’m just north of Houston and haven’t worn a mask except once. Then my toddler kept ripping it off my face and wearing it as a hat so I quit trying. I keep it in my pocket when people ask me if I have one. Yep! But good luck getting it on my face. </p>
<p>The only place that denied me service and asked me to leave was Ross’s in Tomball. Anywhere else I’ve never had a single confrontation from Walmart to H‑E‑B to Specs.</p>

        <p>NICE! I haven't worn a mask this whole time, except I covered my face with a shirt once, the first time it was asked of me, before it was a mandate. The second it became a government intervention thing, I have straight up refused.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I have had several confrontations about it. It does make me nervous and agitated when I can tell there are maskies around, but mostly, people have chilled the fuck out about it now.</p>
<p>So far my favorite of my confrontations is when some old whiny karen told me that I was ""supposed"" to wear a mask, so I told her "and you're supposed to mind your own damn business."</p>
<p>Join the resistance, fight the power, refuse the mask!!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It really works, there have been many times where others, less courageous than me, have seen that I was not wearing  mask and then taken theirs off because they saw that I could do it.</p>

        <p>It was a random guy and he was a dick. Me and my gf were minding our business shopping and out of no where hes like "you need to wear a mask, put your mask on" so we said no we dont, were exempt. Then he said "looks like your breathing just fine, whats your exemption". So I said its none of your fucking business because he was being really rude and not letting up. </p>
<p>When we went in the store the security guard stopped us and said we needed to wear mask and we said we were exempt and she said no problem, go ahead. But this guy tried to be a hero..</p>

        <p>Hahaaaa good on you. That helps my spine a little bit more. I haven't worn a mask outside work since our hard lockdown but I also haven't really been in an unfamiliar store either. Your story is helping to pump me up because I've been considering trying it soon. </p>
<p>But I loathe these fucks who think they can play mask police anywhere they want. Before the 'vid, would any of these people come face to face with some one shop lifting? They MIGHT have tattled to a security guard, but probably would have ignored it.  And for the doomers reading this, it is comparable because as theft goes up, prices go up, which affects you.

        <p>Woo! More and more people around me are shopping without masks. I love seeing it! All ages as well. I always make sure I'm smiling or chatting them up when I can. Try to reinforce their decision making :-)</p>

        <p>UK here also - Welcome to the club ;)</p>
<p>By the way, from what I've seen, "chavs" and working class types are the ones most likely to be maskless and leave you alone. It's the middle-class snooty people who are more likely to give you death stares, at least in my experience.</p>
<p>Also, if it gives you any confidence, I've been maskless since Day 1, and have yet to have someone bother me for not wearing a mask except the "Safety Warden" employees at entrances. I do wear my earphones, so maybe this helps, but I don't avoid eye contact or avert my gaze. If you go in there "feeling guilty" I'd bet you're more likely to seem an easy target. Remember that all you have to do is say you are exempt if someone asks, and the reason "why?" is medically confidential by law - you don't owe anybody an explanation for why you are exempt.</p>

        <p>Do you think it's this easy with public transport? Bus drivers are very aggressive about it where I live, but I haven't tried telling them I'm exempt. I wonder if they expect you to show one of those exemption cards.</p>

        <p>I haven’t used public transport. I imagine it depends on the individual, but the law still stands that you don’t have to wear a mask if you are exempt, and you don’t have to explain why you are exempt (it’s medically confidential).</p>
<p>I’ve read posts of people using the tube and having no problems. The only way to know for sure is if you try it. We have to resist this together, even if it might be uncomfortable.</p>

        <p>Congrats! I've only worn a mask once in 2020. It feels good, doesn't it? South Island, New Zealand.</p>
<p>Edit: 10 upvotes! You do realise that I'm trolling, don't you? I'm pro-lockdown. How do you think NZ got here? With a hard lockdown.</p>
