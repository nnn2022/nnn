    <strong>People are treating reporting side effects like a violation of cult vows and this is how we are determining safety?</strong>
    <p><p>For a variety of completely insane reasons, everyone that I know that has had significant side effects from their vaccines has NOT attempted to report them.</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I actively try not to discuss the vaccine with people so I have a worthlessly small sample size.</p>
<p>My mom got her first dose in January.  She felt terrible afterwards but told no one.  She felt so bad that she wouldn’t get the second shot.  MONTHs of secretly feeling terrible later, she had to be hospitalized for a week for congestive heart failure due to Afib.  She is home now but she has to go back soon because her procedures failed and she is just a stroke waiting to happen until they try again. </p>
<p>No health issues ever before, fit for age etc.</p>
<p>If you ask her, it is a COMPLETE coincidence and anyone who thinks otherwise is a Trump supporter (she is super liberal and if NPR/CNN say it is safe then it is).  </p>
<p>I asked her what her doctors think of the timing and she will not bring it up to them because a)she lied to them and told them she had both doses and doesn’t want to be outed or forced to take a second dose (!!) or b)sound like a Trump supporter.  </p>
<p>So this one isn’t going to be investigated or entered into VAERS.  </p>
<p>My mil also coincidentally developed tinnitus and vertigo after her shots.  It is still an issues 6 months later.  Again, no report because doctors know best and THEY didn’t say anything about the timing.  </p>
<p>The rest are more minor - fainting, vomiting etc - but NO ONE reports anything.  This whole depending on self-reporting thing doesn’t seem so great.
And it certainly COULD be a coincidence but isn’t the point to look into these things?</p>
<p>Please tell me that there is a better way to do this?
Can anyone point me towards a study that looks for vaccine side effects by tracking the hospitalizations/urgent care visits for patients after their vaccination?  There are a few like this that look for post-infection issues: https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1098 so that type of methodology?</p>
<p>I would just feel better if there were a more sincere effort to include cases like my mom’s in the data.</p></p>

        <p>That is simply <em>terrifying</em>, to not speak of iatrogenic harm simply because it goes against a belief system.</p>
<p>But I know of what you speak. My mom passed away years ago but she had always followed the cult of NPR/NYT faithfully.  I loved her but after I became an adult I simply couldn't have any serious discussions with her about political topics. I wasn't especially conservative, nor liberal. I just couldn't buy into the crap.</p>
<p>Now my own children have gotten vaccinated. I gave them each a gentle request to wait and see, but I didn't argue.  All last year, my eldest daughter wouldn't come to see us in our house and unmasked. It had to be outside, and she wore a mask the whole time. Oh, and no hugs or any kind of touch. Then winter came and we refused to sit outside when we have a perfectly comfortable and warm house.  So we didn't see her.  It broke my wife's heart; hell, it broke mine. My wife said it felt like emotional extortion. Our daughter never asked us to get the jab, but wouldn't visit us if we didn't.  Then she got her second jab and suddenly felt confident to be in our house again.</p>
<p>My youngest developed fibromyalgia at age 20.  This is quite unusual, usually it appears in women age 30-50, so she had to visit a number of specialists to finally get the diagnosis. Coincidentally, about six months earlier, she had insisted that she needed the HPV jab. She was off at college. My wife suggested strongly that she not get it, but daughter is headstrong and thought the objections were anti-vaxx nonsense.  We recently saw her for the first time in over a year (she lives out of state) because she got both jabs and finally felt safe to travel.  She mentioned that she felt exhausted, not just because of her missed flight connection, but also that her fibro had flared up recently.  I asked when that had begun, and noted it.  Later as part of a separate conversation, I casually asked when she'd gotten the second mRNA shot.  Did the math - her "fibro flare-up" was about two weeks after her second shot.</p>
<p>I have my suspicions that both the HPV and mRNA shots gave her neurological damage.  But she would absolute refuse to believe it, so I don't bring it up.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear about your mom and I am wishing her a return to health if possible.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the support and I am sorry your daughter has been going through that.  </p>
<p>As a parent of younger children, I am deeply dreading  watching them make decisions like these because we are still in the ‘hey don’t put that in your mouth...you totally just put that in your mouth...’ phase but I can tell they won’t exactly value my input on more harmful choices down the road.  And down the road is getting pushed closer and closer as I see things like no parental consent required 12+.  If they push that down into their age group I will lose my mind.</p>

        <p>It was killing girls when it came out. I refused it for myself &amp; daughter and haven’t kept up on it. You see the way they are forcing covid vaccine on us….they’ve been doing this for years to parents. Ask no questions, or be banned from the doctors office. Literally every year at least one state is trying to eliminate exemptions. I am anti vax because I believe everyone should have a choice about every vaccine or medical procedure.</p>

        <p>This is true. Doctors can be bullies when it comes to vaccines. After a VERY, very bad reaction at age 15 months that lasted several days, I no longer wished to vaccinate my daughter. I had to switch pediatricians 3 times to find a doctor who respected me as a parent.</p>

        <p>Slight silver lining for me is that in the process of digging into Covid vax info, I have been reading a lot about Gardasil.  I guess I have a few years to brace myself for that discussion with my daughter but, like I said above, I am not optimistic I can convince her of anything by then either.</p>

I don't know enough to properly evaluate the science. <a href="https://acrabstracts.org/abstract/human-papilloma-virus-vaccination-fibromyalgia-and-dysautonomia/">This</a> is a survey, not a full study, and its sample size is small.

        <p>That’s definitely it.</p>
<p>I am sensing increased vaccine regrets and I don’t know how that will emotionally translate in the future. For now it seems like a sensitive subject for my vaccinated friends.</p>
<p>I’ve also found that just mentioning things like Fauci funding the Wuhan Lab (which I was mocked for talking about like a year ago) will only solicit awkwardness and silent resentment.</p>
<p>No one can admit they might have been duped. They know covid and the vaccines were a scam but they’d rather just not talk about it than learn from it.</p>
<p>But I know it’s all heard mentality, because I took a bunch of my masked friends to an underground maskless party and they all took off their masks and had fun when they saw everyone else doing it. It’s insane.</p>
<p>I think people will only come around when/if the media tells them to. It’s sad and frustrating but I’m used to it by now.</p>

This is after a year of being ‘crazy living-a-normal-life-because-she-already-had-Covid-and-she-thinks-she’s-smarter-than-CNN lady’ in a very pro-lockdown city so my credibility is shot anyway.  Being proven correct on either count is completely irrelevant.  But I am only recently starting to regret not being more vocal for fear of my own image/offending anyone.</p>
<p>Someone that knows I am refusing the vax was telling me in a weirdly roundabout way that her 12yo daughter was very sick after her first shot.  At the time, I was just trying to listen without being judgmental but, in hindsight, I think it was kind of a cry for help.  Like she wanted me to beg her to not send her for shot 2 because she knows it is a terrible idea but literally cannot make her own choices anymore.  I really didn’t see it at the time and was too caught up in my own ‘act normal, smile and nod’ routine.</p>

<p>Never before has a vaccine been this political, closest was polio.</p>

        <p>Well, you see, normally when a completely new type of vaccine is developed, it goes through extensive animal testing first before then moving on to lengthy, large-scale human trials before it's ever offered to the general public. That way, we know what to expect. </p>
<p>But this time, things were different, because reasons, so literally no one knows for certain what the long-term ramifications of this planet-wide medical experiment will be.</p>

        <p>My sister had a lot of “coincidental” issues after shot 1. I think she didn’t mean to tell me she got it. Then still went for shot 2, felt terrible, fever, aches, chills, etc after shot 2. She probably doesn’t know what VAERS is. She did say she won’t get the booster, uh, good I guess. I really want to be wrong about this stuff but with more reports over time I’m really worried.</p>

        <p>Oh my gosh it’s funny you mention this because that is a specific point I have made to people who are curious why I don’t want the vaccine and I say I understand vertigo is a side effect thats cropping up and I’d rather risk getting Covid then damaging myself by choice by say “having vertigo for the rest of my life”...  I had it for about a year and a half mostly on sometimes off it was debilitating and depressing - I’d definitely be afraid that a shot like this since above all it really seems to be pulling out everyone’s problems via the inflammation it causes, the systemic reaction would trigger this...  and yup rather risk covid (maybe not 10x 🤪) than have vertigo forever!!!!  Plus the blood clot thing is coming up way more in vaccine recipients than they’re telling us about- and that’s the other thing - I don’t like liars!</p>

        <p>Well, for one thing, you have to see things from their perspective. It's not that they don't want to report the side effects, it is because they don't want to think they've been wrong the whole time. It's a very powerful force, I know people who spent their whole lives holding onto a flawed position because they don't want to admit they we're wrong.</p>
<p>I think the best way of getting them to talk is to have peers share the same experience then they are more likely to come out. Such people are collectivists after all.</p>

        <p>That's a scary but good point.  My mom was hospitalized with heart issues but I doubt she reported it.  My sister was quite sick briefly, flu like symptoms.  Other sister recently mentioned menstrual cycle changes... hmm.  Friends called 911 due to side effects.  Babysitter had to call off one day after 2nd shot.  Basically almost everyone I know personally who has gotten one of the covid vaccines has had notable to very serious side effects, and I don't think any of them reported since they don't want to undermine vaccine confidence.
