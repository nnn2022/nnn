    <strong>My OBGYN is really pushing me to get a flu shot this year and it’s strange.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m not sure if it’s covid related but it’s weird. </p>
<p>Normally the flu hits my part of the country pretty late in the flu season so I can gauge how bad it is. If it’s bad I might get a shot, but if not then I won’t. My doctors have always asked me if I want one and if I say no they’re okay with it and always professional. </p>
<p>I’m pregnant and with all the covid vaccine stuff going on I really don’t want a flu shot. I do not think it’s a good choice. I told my doctor that because she asked about it when I was there for a normal prenatal checkup. She was not happy. She was really pushing for me to get it. I’ve seen her for several years and she’s never been this pushy with everything. It could be because I’m pregnant but I asked her and she didn’t answer me. </p>
<p>She was also asking me all sorts of covid type questions, like who I’ve been around and if I have any symptoms. It’s really sketchy. I’ve never liked going to the doctor but now I hate it.</p></p>

        <p>Most doctors seem to be doing this. All of the ones I've seen recently have been the same way: very pushy about getting the flu shot, dodging questions asked about why the flu shot is so necessary, asking tons of personal questions about COVID, treating me like a leper, and so on.</p>

        <p>Look for old doctors that have there own practices and only work a couple days a week, they are hard to get appointments with but they are usual the least brainwashed and the most insightful.</p>

        <p>I absolutely agree about this. But any doctor that doesn’t try to convince the pregnant patient to get a flu shot sucks. That’s the cold hard truth. Doctors aren’t paid to always tell you what you want to hear.</p>
<p>Getting a flu vaccine in pregnancy isn’t a covid conspiracy.</p>

        <p>I disagree. Doctors shouldn’t try to “convince” patients of anything. They should present the options, outcomes, and pricing available, and respect w whichever is the patient’s choice.</p>

        <p>I agree but informed consent means understanding the risks. I can’t tell based on this post why this person doesn’t want a flu vaccine “given the covid situation” - seems weird.</p>
<p>I’m anti lockdown but this seems like common sense. </p>
<p>The doctor has an obligation to explain the risks and if that seemed like pushiness that sucks but there is a reason.</p>

        <p>They don’t have to give a reason but I passionately believe in shared decision making in the field of obstetrics. I don’t want patriarchal and condescending care but the patient should be participating in her own health by engaging in a discussion. This is an important vaccine for pregnant women. If the doctor thinks the mom is putting herself (let alone the baby) at risk it’s her job to make that clear. A one off conversation isn’t mandated by this situation. Again, if they have explored every facet and the patient is gonna go AMA that should be respected.</p>

        <p>In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit, the FDA has <a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/ican-vs-fda-voluntary-dismissal.pdf">admitted</a>, for the first time, that government agencies, including the CDC, are recommending vaccines for pregnant women that have neither been licensed for pregnant mothers by FDA nor tested for safety in clinical trials. The lawsuit, filed by <a href="http://www.childrenshealthdefense.org/">Children’s Health Defense</a>(CHD) attorney, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on behalf of <a href="http://icandecide.org/">Informed Consent Action Network</a> (ICAN), a vaccine safety advocacy group, sought all clinical trial data used by FDA to approve influenza vaccines for pregnant women. The FDA’s terse reply: “We have no records responsive to your requests.”</p>
<p>The manufacturers of <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM619548.pdf">flu</a> and <a href="https://www.drugs.com/boostrix.html">Tdap</a>vaccines warn against their use for pregnant mothers since their safety has never been established. Package inserts state that it is “<a href="https://www.drugs.com/boostrix.html">not known</a>” whether the vaccines “will harm an unborn baby” and there are “<a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM619548.pdf">insufficient data</a>” on use in pregnant women to inform vaccine-associated risks. FDA regulations strictly prohibit pharmaceutical companies from marketing products for “off-license” uses. Noncompliant companies are routinely prosecuted criminally and civilly, paying <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538391/">billions</a> in lawsuits and settlements.</p>

        <p>I used to work for a doctor and in his office we asked about and offered everyone the flu shot and this is going back like ten years. It’s all about money and you’d be surprised how much money giving and documenting about the flu shot can bring for the doctor.

        <p>Hahahaha.  I used to work at a doctor’s office.  We got a $1 profit from giving flu shots.  One year insurance companies would have given us less than cost so we didn’t give them and told people to go to a drug store to get one.  They can afford it because they buy so many doses at once they get a price break.  Believe me, it’s not about money.</p>

        <p>I've never gotten the flu shot. They know most people don't. Not because I fear it but because I don't need it. I don't get the flu either, and am not in a high risk category. They are trying to normalize it so that you'll be less hesitant to get a COVID vaccine.</p>
<p>I do think those questions are pretty standard for medical procedures now. They'll also probably run a COVID test on you when you deliver.</p>

        <p>I think getting the flu when you’re pregnant can cause some really bad side effects. It’s a fear a lot of my pregnant friends have had, prior to covid. It might be the one time I’d opt for a flu shot (I find them to be BS in general even though I believe in other non-flu vaccines, the idea of <em>yearly</em> vaccinations doesn’t sit well with me). </p>
<p>But she should have explained that to you and made a case for it. Not just bullied you to obey orders. And if you felt strongly about not getting one, she should have given you some specific guidelines for how best not to catch flu (pretty much stay home as often as possible - FUN!).</p>

        <p>So although your doctor is just doing their job by pushing the flu shot,  I have heard of some <a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/chd-sues-the-university-of-california-over-mandatory-flu-vaccine-policy/">studies</a> that say that flu shots make you more susceptible to getting coronaviruses. Listen to your gut on this one regardless. If it feels wrong, it probably is.</p>

<p>(paraphrasing with my own words/not actual quotes)
The site I posted: "We think there may be a link between flu shots and susceptibility to coronaviruses, here are some scientific articles that we have selected detailing why we think this to back up our claims and we've also including a contrasting article so you know what other info is out there"</p>
<p>You: "Cherrypicking"</p>
<p>Yes... they quite literally are picking the articles they read to back up their claims, that's how making a claim about something works. It's not on them to also provide every contrasting study out there as they are... wait for it... making a claim not stating an absolute fact.</p>
<p>I'm posting it so OP knows that there are other thoughts out there.</p>

        <p>Flu shots are a revenue stream. If less people have booked in for a flu shot this year (scared of and avoiding places where sick people go) then revenue might be down.
Do what’s best for you, and don’t be pressured into anything you’re not comfortable with.</p>

        <p>Don't get the flu shot and don't answer any questions. Never allow a doctor or any other medical professional, who as someone you hire is supposed to be at your service, to dictate or push you into anything. Fire them all if necessary. Lines must be drawn and examples must be made; if we let these people push us around they'll start to think we work for them instead of the reverse.</p>

        <p>It is most likely because your pregnant and the risk of fever can be detrimental for your baby. </p>
<p>I just had my baby (early covid season) and they pushed the same for me for the first time just because of risk of flu or general sickness impeding the baby’s development.</p>

        <p>i think you have every right to pass on the shot, and i think you should find a new doctor. it doesn't sound like their energy works with your energy, and that's a recipe for disaster. what if they want you to wear a mask during labor? what if they won't let your partner be in the room? what if they want to separate you from your infant because of covid concerns?</p>
<p>have you considered a birthing center? i'm not pushing you in any way, but i've been reading up on midwives and doulas myself lately. there are options out there.</p>
<p>(in fact, this last year i started seeing a new ob/gyn because my old practice became super-sterile and bureaucratic - i felt like they weren't listening to me at all. my new ob/gyn is younger - she's a little crunchy and she loves Jesus, which i never thought i'd like, but she's amazing - but she's also very pro-natural birth, and she is very comfortable with home births, doulas, and midwives. just some food for thought, do what makes you and your partner the most comfortable and confident.)</p>
<p>we're trying to get pregnant right now, and i was on the fence about this year's flu vaccine, and i ultimately decided to get it. why? i decided that since i've never had any adverse effects from getting one in the past 10+ years, and since it's only like 30-60% effective in any given year, i could still get the flu anyway, so what's the harm? i won't be so cavalier about any covid vaccine, but the flu shot seems safe enough.</p>
<p>that said, i'm not pregnant yet, and i might feel very differently when i am.</p>
<p>p.s. all doctors are asking covid-related questions now. the last time i went in for some regular thyroid blood my doctor asked all sorts of questions, and i was like, "i go to work every day, i ride public transit every day, i'm seeing as many people as i can, and i hate wearing a mask so i try not to." he was like, "it be like that sometimes though."</p>

        <p>I have been pregnant twice and got flu shots both times. It is a no brainer to me. Getting the flu when pregnant is definitely bad. Also, If you have flu symptoms during this covid thing, may be more confusion if you aren’t already vaccinated. </p>
<p>Pretty sure the vaccine gives your baby protection early in their life too. That’s why you should also get the pertussis vaccine.</p>

        <p>Ask to see the flu vaccine package insert. Then ask your OBGYN why the package inserts mention a "pregnancy exposure registry" to collect data on pregnancy outcomes and newborn health status following vaccination. Shouldn't they already know if it's safe or not?</p>
<p>Here are a few of the flu shot package inserts.</p>

        <p>I'm someone who is not going to get a vivid vaccine when it comes out but the flu is actually dangerous for babies. There's not real evidence that they can get sick from covid but they can definitely die of the flu. I never get a flu shot but I'll be getting one this year because I have a six month old.</p>

        <p>It will give your baby flu antibodies when he/she is born.  Flu can kill babies.  I got flu shots both times, just like every year for my job (for 30 years!). It’s a standard pregnancy care routine.  It’s nothing new or strange and it’s been recommended since the 90s as far as I can remember.  I would do it, honestly,  but it’s your choice.</p>
