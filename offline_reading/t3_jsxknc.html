    <strong>Restrictions in Italy</strong>
    <p><p>Apparently most people in the US or some other countries are not getting the "full package" of Covid19 restrictions so I am going to list some bullet points about the situation in Italy, where I currently live and let's see if some rules are not (yet) applied to other countries. </p>
<p>Here's the updated list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mask is mandatory everywhere: They don't allow you in building without it, you are not allowed to take it off in ANY public place, not even outdoor. You can't get groceries without a mask, you can't enter school or workplaces. They recently added a law that enforces masks in cars as well if there's another person you don't live with (Friends, relatives etc.) </li>
<li>You are not allowed in large stores without measuring the temperature, if it is 37.5 or higher you can't enter. </li>
<li>The state is currently divided into 3 macro areas: Red, Orange and Yellow zones. In both Red and Orange you aren't allowed to leave your house except for: Health, Work, Food. All Bars, restaurants, pubs and ANY other place aside from groceries stores and pharmacies. </li>
<li>For all zones there's also a curfew from 10pm to 6am. For Red and Orange zones the curfew is 24/7 since you are not allowed to leave your house.  </li>
<li>You are not allowed to leave your region or your municipality for any reason but health, work and other emergencies (Must be valid) in Red and Orange areas, you can't get groceries shopping from another municipality even if it's less than 1km away from you, the very moment you go outside the boundaries you are at risk of fines. </li>
<li>You can't visit relatives or friends in both Red and Orange areas. </li>
<li>You must WFH if your job allows it</li>
<li>Fines are between €500 and €3000 for ANY violation </li>
<li>You must have a written self-certification with you if you leave your house to get food or go to work where you state your address, the destination address and the reasons why you leave your house. Officers may verify the info you provided and fine you if they found out something is not true and you may also face a perjury crime. </li>
<li>The police have already setup some check points that randomly checks your self certification, to get to other municipality or regions you must pass the checks.</li>
<li>If you go to work you are requested to wear your mask for the entire duration of your stay and even during lunch breaks, same thing for schools where children are also not allowed to leave their desk till the end of the lessons. </li>
<li>You can't take your dog out after 10pm and should be near your house.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In some days they will evaluate if the entire country can be classified as "Red Zone", if that will be the case they are going to apply those rules (1-12) to the entire state indefinitely. </p>
<p>I wonder what will happen to Christmas this year, we don't even know if we will be able to be with our families. </p>
<p>Tell me your thoughts guys...</p></p>

<p>If the restrictions don't work, why are they adding more restrictions? It's like when a puzzle piece doesn't fit, and you repeatedly jam in the same piece instead of trying another one. This governmental ignorance is costing lives and livelihoods.</p>

        <p>That's a great question, they just keep adding restrictions. 
If the first lockdown worked we wouldn't be in such situation again, don't you think? 
But they are really good blaming the people for not respecting rules and portray themselves as "the good one" that actually care about the health and wellbeing of people.</p>

        <p>I'm sad to say that things are beginning to look a little grim here as well, although not as grim as that list we just saw. In most regions we are strongly advised to stay home unless it's absolutely necessary to go out (grocery store, pharmacy, work etc). Although it's not mandatory, government advice is often taken seriously up here, so many shop owners are probably gonna suffer a lot from this. They've closed a lot of libraries and museums. They're currently looking at a ban on alcohol after 10 PM. Now, a lockdown is out of the question, but they're getting a lot of pressure from the rest of the world when it comes to masks, so I'm guessing a mask recommendation on public transport isn't far off even here in Sweden now...</p>

        <p>This has all happened very quickly. I still think it’s a pretty sane place, you won’t have the state controlling your every move here. I’m more scared of the pressure the government could be facing from the EU internally. The fact that we’re so reluctant to wear masks could ultimately cause a conflict with other EU countries, seeing as most countries are convinced that the masks are 100% effective. It could affect future travel bans and quarantine restrictions for example.</p>

        <p>From what I learned same restrictions are in various european states. It started in March and it is getting worse. What I foresee happening is that they will turn it like Australia basically anything you say against these restrictions will be an offense even on the internet. They can break in and drag you out of your house. They clearly isolate people so it's easier to control them.</p>

        <p>Luckily not, but if you are transporting someone you don't live with then yes. <br>
For example your girlfriend if she doesn't live with you, or your relatives. You both must wear the mask for the entire duration of the travel else you may face a fine if caught without it.</p>

        <p>This is why so many are protesting but protesting does nothing. People need to truly go after the elites pushing these restrictions, go after the ones in the government doing this and well... You know what to do to them🙄</p>

        <p>It doesn’t even take a vast majority. </p>
<p>If even 20% of the population refuses to comply, this stops. They cannot arrest that many people, they cannot fine that many people. </p>
<p>That’s literally all it takes: for a bunch of people to act like free, independent humans with inalienable rights and say “fuck off.”</p>
