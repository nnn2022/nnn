    <strong>A Message To All The People On This Sub, Who Are Losing Hope and Are Depressed Regarding The Current Circumstances. Must Read.</strong>
    <p><p>There have been many posts in the past couple days regarding people losing hope, and feeling depressed and being very uncertain about their future and career goals. </p>
<p>First of all, before I say anything, you are all very blessed and privileged to be on this Sub. Yes. You are very aware and red pilled regarding society and what's truly happening around Us, and the direction we are heading towards. You are ahead of the Game. While the doomers are still quadmasking, with their hazmat suits on and thinking we are "progressing." </p>
<p>All of Us on this Sub, did not come into this world to be fucking lab rats. F that. We all came here for a purpose and our purpose is not to give away our basic freedoms, and rights for a disease which has a 99.7% survival rate. How foolish of the doomers, who have given away their everything for all this? You are very lucky that you have the real knowledge and are truly woke. </p>
<p>The government, society and the media wants you to have suicidal thoughts and wants you to be depressed. They do not give a F about you. In the end, YOU have to make something of this life, and get ahead in anyway possible you can. Because in the end, it's just you. Since the beginning of time, it has only been survival of the fittest, and never survival of the unfittest. Every person here must Master Machiavellianism. Regarding how to act, what to say in each and every situation he is confronted with, and use it for his own benefit in a very clever and intellectual way. </p>
<p>People spend their whole life in thinking what he/she/society will think about me and guess what? They are left nowhere. They neither achieve their goals, because they put others above them, and they lose all the respect people had for them (These are the Doomers). Why? Because they keep on obeying and bowing down to society and taking it up the ass from them, and then they are taken for granted. Once your that vulnerable, your destiny is only to get used and thrown out, and that's the exact fate and destiny of the doomers that will take place. You must never be too agreeable, rather stick to your principles and values. Always. The government doesn't gaf about you neither the doomers. LOL. The doomers are only their lab rats and guinea pig to test their experimental gene therapy "vaccines." </p>
<p>You come alone in this life, and you die alone. So, dgaf about others and what they think about you, rather do what YOU have to do. We are lucky that we understand all this and we were never meant to obey to anyone (except God). This is a free fucking country and F them doomers. You know, I wish we all were neighbors and could have partied and got fked up everyday. There are a only a very few people who are truly woke. Don't fall into the trap of society and get depressed, rather take life as an adventure and an game and do NOT fear death. Live everyday like it's your last, as life is very short and enjoy it and dgaf about anything except yourself. In the end, nobody is helping you. You have to help yourself. Be positive, try making like minded friends and do what you have to do. Remember, whenever any of you gets those thoughts, you are only making the government and media happy. You want them happy? F them. They can go F themselves, only make yourself and your loved one's happy. That's it.</p></p>

        <p>Darkest hour is before the dawn. The propaganda is ramping up because they are desperate.
We can disarm the Covidian state by a thousand tiny cuts to the point where it no longer impacts our lives. Make local connections - shops - Telegram.
Plenty of forgers out there, they will want our money.
Fuck the giant corporations</p>
