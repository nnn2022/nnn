    <p><p>Something big and sinister is being covered up and it isn’t just the great reset. That could have been pushed on us in much easier ways.  <br>
No, this virus was pounced upon and blown up and used at distraction, as well as all the other insane things that have happened this past year. All distraction, smoke and mirrors, getting you to look the other way. </p>
<p>All those involved will never reveal anything, and if one or two do get caught in a lie (Fauci), it wont make a drop of difference to all the people who’s lives got ruined.</p></p>

        <p>It all started in September of 2019. That's about the time the yield curve started to invert. That's also when the Fed started to backdoor QE again. My wife and I actually started making preparations back then for collapse, months before the Covid psyop.</p>
<p>The Global Financial System is toast. They couldn't face the people, bearing the blame of global economic collapse. Thus the need for Plan B.</p>

        <p>YESSSSSSS!!!!! Someone else besides me saw it too!!!</p>
<p>They started repo operations to the tune of $100B/week and at first tried to start a war with Iran, cause war requires more printing. That didn’t work so they went with covid. </p>
<p>Covid is a banker scam</p>

        <p>Some of us are REALLY paying CLOSE attention. Glad to hear I wasn't alone. It was BIG news if you were looking at the right information sources at the time.</p>
