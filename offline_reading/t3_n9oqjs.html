    <strong>What the fuck to believe?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m on your guys side of the argument and have been since last summer, but I just don’t know what to believe anymore. Both sides of the argument have valid points (although more biased to this side). My life is just turned completely upside down, so believing things nowadays is impossible.</p></p>

        <p>Pandemics are bad and we should do things to stop them. But you don't throw the baby out with the bath water.</p>
<p>There have been no considered cost benefit analysis of the measures countries have forced upon their people. No considerations on the very real deleterious effects mandates have. At least nothing that has been stuck to. Coupled with frankly guess work from many experts: take the masking mandates, even the WHO admitted there was no clear evidence for their use by the public, government officials the world over recommended against their public use then later did a 360 pretending their original, and rational, reasoning no longer applied. Take the distancing rules. How far is safe? Some countries recommend 1 meter, others 2 meters, some 6 feet. Then there's mixing rules, originally it was deemed unsafe for any households to mix in the UK, only after a few months did the idea of "bubbles" appear. Currently you can go to a supermarket with a load of other people and even queue up in a shopping centre for stores but it is verboten to sit distanced inside a restaurant or pub. Showing a lack of consistency.</p>

        <p>Here, let me show you.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% IFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual IFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>. In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>In addition to this, <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/thousands-of-women-report-hemorrhaging-reproductive-dysfunction-miscarriage-after-corona-shots">the numbers with regard to fertility changes in women</a> strongly suggest that the vaccine has a negative impact on fertility and on pregnancy. </p>
<p>Here is a list of studies showing masks don’t work:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">No evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200818072706/https:/www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown">Mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">University of Illinois concluded face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/13523664">Japanese researchers found that cloth masks “offer zero protection against coronavirus”</a></p>

        <p>I had Covid pneumonia back in October because I have a rare immune deficiency that’s why I got Covid bad and got the j and j vaccine. I’m 30 years old.</p>
<p>I have no lingering issues from either. I know about 20 other people mostly family members that got Covid and it was a joke to them and it was no big deal. This includes my 80 year grandma even, my mom and my wife and 3 kids. They all barely had symptoms. I have heard through my wife she knows some people that had some more serious Covid infections at her school. </p>
<p>She has told me that none of the teachers that got vaccinated have gotten sick with Covid at her school or at least none showed symptoms to cause them to go get tested. Wife’s a principal so she’s constantly dealing with Covid issues. All the kids that caught it have been fine and all their family members are fine. </p>
<p>This is just my eyewitness account. Covid makes no sense. My kids just got sick a month ago with a cold and we’re way sicker than when they had Covid. But like I said I ended up
In the hospital but again I’m not a good base because even I have a rare immune deficiency that makes me more vulnerable to even common illnesses.</p>
<p>For when I did get Covid redsimir and an antibody treatment got me better in like a week. People were shitting on the redsimir because trump got it but I think it definitely helped me.</p>
<p>Imo get the vaccine it ain’t a big deal. But shit needs to get back to normal. The old/most vulnerable got the vaccine we should be fully back to normal.</p>
