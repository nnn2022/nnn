    <strong>You guys should demand for direct government aid; not for everything to be brought back magically as if it never happend.</strong>
    <p><p>Like, too many people in the states are unemployed, 60 of all the workers under 25 years were freelancers. People right now are struggling to much, if everything went back to normal unemployment would skyrocket because as of now people are not reporting it, finding a job would be impossible, and too many small business have been damaged beyond repair, and while all of this is happening the government just gave big companies kickback loans</p>
<p>I'll just tell you how people are doing in italy:</p>
<p>It's simple, I live in Italy and during this pandemic we have a simple system, if you are earning less that 70% of what you where earning in 2019, the state will give you 100% of the money you should have earned, so you can make ends meet, big business are not in danger, and big companies need to prove that they need the money before getting it </p>
<p>Here the situation is more calm, peaceful and patience is the main word of encouragement we use </p>
<p>We have strict lockdowns, curfew and fines if we don't respect them </p>
<p>My parents have been getting 800 euros a month each to make ends meet, we are not swimming in gold right now, I have just completed my bachelor degree so I never have had stable income, but still everyone here, is doing fine </p>
<p>And then I see this subreddit, and people instead of asking for a measured and appropriate response, people want to act as if it's not happening, and I can tell you, that these statistics that are showing on the subreddit are misleading to say the least, hospitals are overworked and people are dying, a lot, the media is blowing it up for sure, but it's not something to downplay, it's a time of crisis, not an experiment by an authoritarian governament, and from the outside it seems that only like half of the country is collaborating, and because of this you guys still are in the first wave, we passed the first here in Italy, and the second one is unfolding..... it's not something we can just ignore, it might be that there on the usa people don't live densely (just half) so you can't see with your eyes how many people are affected, but I know myself 5/10 people who died, and I knew them, sure, most of them friends of my grandparent, but even folks in the 60 which is the age of my dad, and I wouldn't want him to risk it </p>
<p>Anyway, people on the usa should ask the government for direct aid and not economic kickbacks by giving big companies money.... people would happily wait at home if the government gave a single fuck, people say that biden will just lock them up, but I think he will give a lot of money as well..... so everyone can make it trough </p>
<p>Footnote: so many people are against getting money from the government in the usa it's so fucling weird, I guess that you guys vilified communism so much that anykind of social program is seen as china/russia trying to have influence over there..... it's just weird</p></p>

        <p>It's not only about the economy. It's also about mental health and individual freedoms.</p>
<p>Also, there's no free lunch. All that government "help" comes from either taxes, money printing or debt.</p>

        <p>This is so stupid. Where do you think this money comes from?</p>
<p>Yes please, I’d like the government to steal $10000 from me, filter it through eighteen layers of bureaucratic filth, then give me back $600 and act they’re doing me a fucking favor. </p>
<p>And the absolute gall of an Italian saying this shit? Your country has been bankrupt for years, it’s just a question of when the next big collapse is.</p>

        <p>Italy has the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/">3rd highest per capita deaths from the rona in the world</a>, so whatever you think of how dangerous this virus is your approach has been a failure. Your sacrifice was for nothing. You have given up a year of your life, destroyed the livelihoods of millions, and ballooned the public debt in order to have zero impact on a virus that already had no impact on life expectancy.</p>

        <p>where do you think money that the state has comes from? You think there is just a money tree we shake down every morning and dollarinos fall from it? It comes from our taxes. Every last dollar the government is worth either has or WILL come off the back of a hardworking tax payer. I have a job already..what sense does it make for me to demand the government give me more of what was already mine when I could just say to give me a tax cut? If I am demanding money back, by implication I have given the government an interest free loan. It's like giving me a credit card with a massive APR and saying "dude it has a 600$ limit, go ahead and spend it, it's free!" I'm sitting here thinking, no it damn well isn't, I'm going to see that on a statement again. I'd rather just use my debit card.</p>

        <p>You'll never get through to anyone here using solid logic like that, they see what they want to see and they want to see conspiracy where there is none because they think someone is out to get them when it's really about helping them. </p>
<p>They will accuse you of being brainwashed and how they are "woke" when it's really the opposite and they have chosen to not trust science and then down vote anyone who disagrees into oblivion because it upsets the echo in the chamber of their own false beliefs, just like they will to this comment.</p>
