    <strong>New here - what is the consensus on what's going on?</strong>
    <p><p>So I came here from another post about masks and was ready to hate on ya'll - I thought I'd encounter a bunch of complete COVID deniers. I was surprised at how much a lot of the posts here resonated with me. I do think this virus is real and very dangerous. I lost my 76 year old aunt to it and had a younger friend get quite ill, though he has recovered now. I do not want to catch it. I do wear a mask when I go out to stores, but not when I walk my dog, and I am extremely fortunate that I am able to earn a living sitting on my ass in front of a computer at home so I hardly ever go out. I live alone. </p>
<p>This past year has been brutal for my mental and physical health, especially now that it's winter in Chicago and I'm basically snowed in on top of everything else. I think I'm just over it. I don't how much longer I can live like this, even though COVID still seems to be a threat. The news and guidance from "experts" just gets more and more confusing as the weeks go on. I am on the fence about getting the vaccine - I will not be eligible for several months regardless so I figure I'll decide when the time comes.  </p>
<p>So I guess I'm wondering if I actually do fit in here or if I've misread you guys. Can anyone relate? Any former mask-wearing, COVID fighting people who just can't do it anymore? Where do we go from here?</p></p>

        <p>I’d say there’s mixed opinions about the virus itself but nobody here believes it’s “deadly” enough to justify these restrictions. The reality is there is no end game to this these politicians will do whatever they want if we let them.</p>

        <p>Yes - that's where I'm at. The fact that I know so few people who have contracted the virus and become ill after a whole year makes me think this is overblown, and it is  extremely suspicious that financial power has shifted to such extreme levels. I am irate that no support whatsoever was offered to small businesses, artists, freelancers, etc. The only thing that kept me (and still keeps me) wearing a mask and social distancing is what I've seen happening in some hospitals around the country with totally overwhelmed staff, but even that has only happened in really small pockets where there was a perfect storm of virus spread. </p>
<p>And now it looks like there is no end. There has to be an end. The 1918 pandemic ended and they didn't even have vaccines.</p>

        <p>If you do even minimal research, you’ll see that it’s completely overblown. It is so obvious that this is a scam. A complete fabricated pandemic. A pandemic created and propped up by bogus, one sided, doctored statistics. </p>
<p>I think it’s all to usher in the age of the vaccine. Too much money in vaccines. Wait until you see governments remove people’s rights for not getting this experimental gene therapy vaccine.</p>

        <p>I'll pause my skepticism to welcome you here. The people we are at odds with aren't willing to set preconceived notions aside.</p>
<p>We're not entirely denying the virus, we just know better than to accept the quality of life that's been thrust upon us. There are truly worse things than the virus.</p>
<p>I have family that would've died in this if they hadn't already died from cancer a few years ago. I have family members and friends I worry about to some degree, I'm not heartless. But I know that they wouldn't want this any more than I would. </p>
<p>So, thanks for being cool. Look around, read up. Pay attention.</p>

        <p>We are all at various stages of skepticism here. We share thoughtful conversations, complaints, good news, frustrations, ideas, memes, and even shit posts. </p>
<p>One thing is for sure though...we are a breath of fresh air from the doom and gloom 24/7 on some of the other subs. It’s refreshing to talk to others who are looking for actual answers and discussions that cannot be had on other subs w/o the typical “FOLLOW SCIENCE! MASKS!COVIDIOT!” Responses. We get it...you follow the science. Can we discuss nuance, values, and our different moral compasses on what we consider most important. </p>
<p>So basically, welcome! Feel free to stay, read, chat, engage, and even disagree. It’s great to expand outside of your typical realms.</p>

        <p>OP, you'll fit in just fine. 
Most of us are pretty open-minded to facts and reality. 
We're not rabid anti- or pro- anything other than our right to make our own decisions and that a "new normal" should not be forced on anyone. 
Stay smart. Do the right thing.</p>

        <p>She contracted the virus early on in a care home - she was recovering from hip surgery. I believe she did die of COVID but was extremely high risk (obese, diabetic, elderly) so it was very sad but not a huge shock, to be honest.</p>

        <p>Honestly, just make sure you’re as healthy as possible (eating right and exercising) and you will most likely be fine. It’s wild to me that instead of telling the public <em>that</em> , they spent almost a year terrifying people and stressing them out.</p>
<p>If we’d have used this as more of a reform on paid sick-leave, people would be far less stressed. Not even going to go into the mental health pressures of the last year...</p>

        <p>This is exactly the point. Instead of treating every single person like an infected plague rat how about let us do what's best for our health without restrictions. I know how to keep myself healthy it's not my responsibility to wear a piece of cloth over the holes I use to breathe because some doomer is afraid of whatever the media tells them. This puts a lot of pressure on sane people who just want to live. If you're insane and want to stay home and be scared that's an acceptable choice just not to be forced on the public.</p>

        <p>The only thing all of us agree on here is that lockdowns cause more harm than good. Everyone else has pretty varied opinions on everything. I too wear a mask when I go to a public place, not because I necessarily believe it’s going to prevent getting or transmitting COVID but because I live in a country where mask wearing is normal anyway (in Asia). My best friends grandmother just died (not of COVID) and he and his family were unable to visit her during her last days so she died completely alone and isolated as a 95 year old woman who had been sick for years. This is cruel. My parents live in the US and I’ve been unable to visit since the start of this thing. I’m getting married next week and they’re not allowed to visit, and I’m unable to return to my home if I leave. This is cruel as well. </p>
<p>I think any opinions are welcome here as long as you’re not of the mind that asking questions = killing grandma. We’re all anti lockdown but there’s a diversity in opinions here regarding masks, the deadliness of the virus, etc. </p>
<p>Welcome, and please continue to question things!</p>

        <p>Thank you for the welcome. Yes, it's so tragic all these elderly people of dying (of COVID or not) and not having their loved ones with them in their last moments. I have not seen my elderly parents in Florida since Christmas 2019, and in March 2020 their first grandchild was born (in NYC) and neither me nor my parents have been able to meet him yet. It just sucks, and it's time that we can never, ever get back. I know my situation is mild compared to most, but literally everyone has lost something this past year.</p>

        <p>Its cool that you came here and posted without being overly judgmental! Everyone here probably has a different opinion on covid. For myself I do take it serious, but I'm extremely skeptical of the direction this seems to be pushing society. </p>
<p>It it definitely a serious enough issue to warrant collective national efforts, but as time has gone on it seems that sweeping lockdowns are not a sustainable, nor effective, model. Also, when this all began we didn't quite know what we were dealing with. The modeling and projections made covid out to seem like some existential threat. More data and more time has shown this to be inaccurate, but I think most countries policies still reflect the initial fear and hysteria that came in the beginning. </p>
<p>I think there is a "new normal" that is being sold to us under the justification of safety, and this new normal of limited human interaction is deeply against what is natural to us. This past year has made me more miserable than I've ever been in my life, and I think it is also doing the same to others. I worry about a new culture where safety and public health takes precedence over the right to self determination and happiness.</p>
<p>I'm sorry that you lost your aunt to covid.</p>

        <p>Yes, I'm extremely skeptical that all these super-variants emerged just as it looked like we were getting things under control. That's when I really took a step back, and was like, this isn't right. What's hard for me to get my head around though is that I DON'T believe it's malicious, at least not on some huge conspiratorial scale. I just think most people are really, really stupid, including (especially?) the people we have running things.</p>

        <p>I don't think there is some grand conspiracy, I just think it's the nature of government to try and expand their powers in the case of any perceived threat. This can be seen after terrorist attacks, mass shootings, etc. I don't really think it's being done maliciously either, it's just that we are valuing public health above all else in an irrational manner. </p>
<p>Suicides, depression, economic hardship, government debt are all very real and important things we should be taking into consideration in covid response, but are being more or less ignored by people making public policy. I think part of the reason is that covid cases and death stats (even if they are generated improperly) are a very clear and objective thing to look at, whereas a lot of the problems associated with this "new normal" (poor quality of online education and it's long term consequences for the workforce, reduced cancer screening and cancelled operations, closed gyms and people getting less exercise) are things that will not manifest in stats for a long time. I also doubt an uptick in negative stats 5 years from now won't be connected to the lockdowns taking place now. </p>
<p>I'm just super skeptical of the whole "monopoly on truth" that the government and wanna be "scientists" are taking. There are tons of epidemiologists who have spoken out against lockdowns, but that info doesn't seem to be as important. It seems like there is a correct narrative to follow and those that don't are labeled as anti science, stupid trump supporter, etc, even when there is perfectly valid evidence and science opposing the standard narrative.</p>

        <p>Yes, I totally agree with all of this. "Truth" is a slippery thing, even when handled by the most objective and well-meaning people. I was 16 on 9/11 and it had an enormous impact on my psyche, which I didn't even fully realize until years later. I can't even imagine what this pandemic is doing to kids now -- and it's our own choice.</p>

        <p>I'm not too right wing and I don't really think its communist propaganda. I think its just a reflection of a culture where safety and public health are valued more than individual liberty. non western cultures (south america, eastern europe) seem to give less of a shit just because I think their culture doesn't try to coddle everyone and keep them overly safe.</p>

<p>This is exactly what they want to put in your mind! We should not rule our life based on a common goal or perfect society. This is dangerous cause you become manipulate-able. Soon the common goal is to get vaccinated for the public health.. Soon the first vaccine require a booster 6 months later... We should aim for the freedom and respect of our constitution. Everyone should be free and if you want to stay safe, you are free to do so.  It's not about culture, its about staying with a clear goal in mind that history told us to protect at all cost!</p>

        <p>The consensus is that this is a fabricated crisis for the purpose of seizing political power. And effectively, politicians have acquired a level of control over society never seen before.</p>
<p>So yes, I'd say we are Covid deniers. If you'd like to know why, we can explain politely as long as you remain polite on your end.</p>
<p>Perhaps you're better suited for r/lockdownskepticism. They believe Covid is a threat, but oppose lockdowns and its devastating impact in society.</p>
<p>Now, when will this end? It is a toss of a coin. If politicians have their way, it is anything between 2 and 7 years.</p>
<p>But there have been some small victories, whether that is by pushing back or just by successfully ignoring the rules.</p>

        <p>I don't agree that the virus was completely fabricated from the get-go - I just think that level of conspiracy is impossible. Humans are not smart enough to pull something like that off. But I'm definitely open minded and will never name call or anything. If I see something I don't agree with I usually just don't respond.</p>

        <p>We live in a connected world. Coordinated efforts on this level might've been impossible 30 years ago, but not anymore.</p>
<p>If you're here, I assume that you believe there has been some level of dishonesty about what we've been told.</p>
<p>And the thing is, politicians and the press have lied about the same things in every country: How the deaths are counted, the disease's lethality, the accuracy of PCR tests and so on.</p>
<p>How is it possible for that coincidence to happen unintentionally?</p>

        <p>I don't think anyone has been intentionally dishonest (maybe a few individuals have for personal gain, but nothing conspiratorial) - I genuinely think the human species is too stupid to be that coordinated. I believe that about all conspiracy theories - 9/11 etc. Like, people in the past genuinely believed that illness came from "humors" in your bile. That wasn't a conspiracy, that's what the science told them at the time. Of course I believe modern medicine is more reliable, but the amount of information we don't know still far outweighs the information we do. </p>
<p>Now, if someone is arguing this is all a coordinated attack from the animal kingdom to take down humanity - I'm all ears for that lol.</p>

        <p>I just stumbled on to this sub. 
Reading these posts reminds me of how I used to be, and how much I've changed and grown.
I used to be into conspiracy theories BIG time. 
Now I cringe when I think about some of the ridiculous things I used to believe in.
I'm so grateful I'm not stuck in that fearful,paranoid antivaxxer way of thinking.
I thought I was "Woke" ! That I had secret knowledge of what's really going on("look at all those sleepwalking brainwashed sheeple!")
But in reality, I was a scientifically illiterate fool who had never learnt about logical fallacies and cognitive biases. 
I'm so happy to be living in New Zealand, where life has been back to normal for the last 9 or so months.</p>
