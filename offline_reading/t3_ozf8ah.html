    <strong>Drug addiction is mainly caused by mental health care not being easily accessible</strong>
    <p><p>Depression, PTSD, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are common among drug addicts. That’s because mental health treatment isn’t easily accessible. People think all drug addicts are useless scum, when there are some who are just trying to self medicate. Some people are out on the waiting list for a year before they are allowed to see a professional, mainly because they have crappy insurance and the clinics have a waiting list. I was one of those people. I have bipolar disorder and spent a year in jail for drugs. I was only trying to self medicate and never harmed anyone.</p></p>

        <p>And even then, SSRIs dont work for everyone. I have had depression for more than half of my life. I'd rather feel my emotions than become a zombie or experience the side effects of those medications.</p>

        <p>I found tianeptine helps me more than standard SSRI meds prescribed here. It carries its own risks for sure, but I don't need it to build up in my system, or take it every day. It's prescribed as the first line of defense against depression in eastern Europe. </p>

        <p>Being someone struggling with my mental health currently, I can attest that it's been tough to stay away from drugs despite that being my go-to. Without insurance or doctors who actually listen and don't treat an educated patient like a criminal, I'm left to my own resources. </p>
<p>I've been able to stay clean though, because using would be a sure way to lose custody during my divorce. </p>
<p>Fuck life. Thanks for listening lol</p>

        <p>I was one of those kids too. Used to make me insanely depressed and even physically difficult to speak sometimes. Nobody believed me including the doctor who prescribed it.</p>
<p>Started pretending to take it in late high-school when I figured out it was the cause and stopped all together after I turned 18. Now I don't trust doctors and people wonder why.</p>

        <p>They had me stay over night at the doctor's office. They poured a gel all over my head and put on a helmet with wires sticking outta it...lol... to monitor my brain waves.</p>
<p>They turn off the light and say... ok go to sleep. </p>
<p>I don't think I got an ounce of sleep that night.</p>

        <p>Behavioral Health will always take a back seat until we can find a way to make the services profitable.</p>
<p>Think about it...Orthopedic procedures, Heart, Oncology, Neuro, Interventional Radiology etc. They all make the hospital a significant ammount of money. Behavioral Health units will barely break even. This is largely because Insurance has a "hard time" quantifying treatments...how long does it take to cure depression exactly? On the other hand, a procedure like a heart catheterization is infinitely easier to price, same equipment same basic time frame etc.</p>
<p>Also the population of patients tends to be erratic, non-compliant with treatment, and a general liability when it comes to safety. With Behavioral Health units at barely break even, most hospitals would rather not have them at all. They tolerate them, so they can say that they are full service.</p>

        <p>Mental health treatment is often just giving people drugs that are less tested than street drugs. It would be great if we had mental health treatment that actually worked instead of just being another attempt to monetize people's illnesses. Personally I've seen people better off on soft street drugs like psychedelics and cannabis than pharmaseutical psychotropics. I have several friends that only became more mentally unstable after consulting the help of a psychiatrist.</p>
