    <strong>Service industry - challenges to hire and keep staff?</strong>
    <p><p>I am not a full-time server but I work part time in a bar as a side hustle.</p>
<p>In March 2020 the start of the pandemic we had a lot of people just straight up quit and didn’t really leave any kind of follow up or explanation. Although I get it...as a single young person I don’t have the same health condition or family conditions as they might have. So everybody is different.</p>
<p>But overall, my place is needing to hire new staff and we can’t seem to find solid help outside of the prexisting people that wee from pre-Covid. I’ve also in general seen stores and places wanting help, however, it appears like a lot of people aren’t biting. Or people join for a bit then bail. I mean we know the service industry in general can be that away.</p>
<p>But given conditions...and I hate to sound like this...but I have to wonder if servers and such are comfortable not working given the pandemic and the unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>I recognize that people may be worried about their health and don’t want to expose themselves which I recognize that as a legitimate concern.</p>
<p>However, at some point, with vaccines and things easing up, I feel like people are going to have to work and I’m just wondering if service will go back into the industry or go on to something else that exposes them less. </p>
<p>If a place is short staffed and already struggling for help as things begin to reopen and restrictions are lifted I’m just wondering if restaurants will be able to operate in regular capacity and service if they don’t have ample staff.</p>
<p>Also, are the staff members that you work with now the same ones from before Covid or have you had turnover?</p></p>

        <p>There are both people who are afraid and those who didnt like to work to begin with. no judgement. either way, the gov has disincentivized them like Trump said it would. Globalism wants basic universal income.</p>

        <p>People are getting paid more to be on unemployment in some cases so why would they choose to work? It’s going to bite them in the ass when the feds cut off those unemployment and food stamp top offs and they’re all scrambling to find work...</p>

        <p>My friend wanted to work, but refused because of the mask mandate. So I wonder if that's also a huge part of it. We only do mask theater at my job so we only wear one for maybe 15 minutes total out of an 8 hr day. I'm noticing a ton of WE'RE HIRING signs when I drive places.</p>

        <p>Companies that impose medical tyranny on their employees will soon be without the number of employees they need. This is already happening where I live. If you require people to wear masks or get tested, people are saying screw you and finding something else to do. I mean, most of these jobs are not paying that well already and now the employer wants to be your doctor-daddy too? It's not going to work.</p>
