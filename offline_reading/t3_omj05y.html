    <strong>"Build Back Better" ... After we incite everybody to tear it all down?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been thinking about this "build back better" mantra...</p>
<p>Could it be that world leaders really are trying to duck things up so badly that everybody will revolt and reform governments all around the world?</p>
<p>With the idea that after the revolution, those remaining would/should "build back better"?</p>
<p>I haven't thought it through too much ...</p>
<p>I'm not sure if so many government officials around the world would all agree/want that same thing, at the same time like this.</p>
<p>Some people claim they're all controlled by "elites" or whatever.  IDK about all that, but maybe.  If so though, most all nations revolting and reforming their governments would seem to most likely work against the "elites" self-interests.</p>
<p>I can't imagine anything realistic that would lead most all world governments to want to incite everybody to reform most all world governments.</p>
<p>Unless the govt officials that are "controlled by" these elites are revolting against these "elites"?  IDK, that might be plausible.  Maybe the govt officials have had enough, maybe there was a straw that broke the camels' backs, maybe there was a plan or event that went or would go too far.</p>
<p>Given that there's a number of holes in the idea, we HAVE BEEN observing that the degree of (apparent) incompetence seems extreme.</p>
<p>But it being "incompetence" is from the perspective that they have a mind to actually do the 'right' (or 'best') thing...</p>
<p>While <em>at the same time</em>, we point out over and over that the government CAN'T BE expected to do the 'best' thing, and probably not even a 'right' thing.</p>
<p>Could it be that we are more correct than we realize, and what's going on is a few steps further than we've seriously thought about, in the same direction we're already thinking?</p>
<p>The bizarreness from most governments seems like it might be consistent with this idea.</p>
<p>If I'm missing anything that obviously shows this isn't it, please kindly point it out.</p></p>

        <p>There's no guarantee that socialist would win.  The opposite would appear to be the case.</p>
<p>If the vaccine is dangerous, if a large portion of vaxxed will die within 3 years, if most vaxxed are sicialist, then NON-socialists are the ones that will be revolting and then rebuilding.</p>

        <p>"Out of chaos, order" is another one of their mantras so don't think the unrest is working against them in any way. Destabilization of the West is all part of the plan. Bring down the West, make them crave civility and calm so much they're willing to give up their rights and personal integrity. Then bring in the Chinese social credit system x 1000. </p>
<p>One world peace and happiness will happen too of course, to help sell it. You know, rainbows n fairies while we all get fucked in the ass by the beast system.</p>
<p>They all benefit no matter how much their people suffer, so it's not surprising they would all want the same thing. It all leads to them having more control in the long run. Just the perpetuation of the system guarantees that they keep feeding. So don't let em bite you (with fear)</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum is like the tip of the iceberg and they've been doing this for decades. Well truly, millenia, but in this iteration it's been going for at least the past century. This shit isnt anything new. The World Wars helped them consolidate power and set the stage for globalism. Now they just need to stamp out any remaining individuality and make us all robots. Either literally or figuratively, they do not care. Cattle are cattle, just so long as they produce</p>
<p>At the highest levels, all these people are related. Fidel was second cousins with Grace Kelly for fuck's sake. The lower levels are like middle management (presidents, prime ministers, etc. are meant to execute orders, not write the playbook)</p>
<p>Here's the rub (for them): they've been trying to stamp out the human Spirit since the beginning of time. And yet, we're still here, just as strong as we ever were. Our backs have always been against the wall, for all of time, but yet humanity is still here. The secret: without coercion they are powerless. If their spells don't spin you, you have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Power to the People!</p>

        <p>Continuing to push and push and push the people eventually results in revolution, not ultimately "give us more".</p>
<p>When you say "they" ... Who is "they"?  I was fairly careful to refer to these people or those people, but your "they" is entirely ambiguous.  Why not pin down more precisely what sort of person you're referring to?</p>

        <p>My head is so full of horrible things right now I need brain bleach. I feel like I have more to fear from my own government than anyone else but I do feel this is a global effort. I have been naive for most of my life. I am falling down so many rabbit holes right now and it has convinced me that we are governed by absolute psychopaths. The fact that our CIA actually tossed around the idea of bombing a boat of Cuban refugees and launching a terror campaign all over Miami killing innocent civilians as well as using bio weapons on Cuban crops to cause a famine... as well as introducing dengue fever there which would have and even and did (dengue fever) kill people to make Castro look bad has got me in a place where I feel like there's absolutely nothing they wouldn't do to kill innocent people to achieve their sick goals.</p>
<p>I do think there is a global plan going on right now. It's no coincidence that France and Greece are doing very similar things. They aren't acting like independant countries anymore. It's obvious we aren't living in democracies now. So many things are happening that ignore law and our constitution because we are in an "emergency".</p>
<p>My gut take on this as somebody who has been taking in all sorts of information over the last year-and-a-half is that covid is real. It's definitely a virus and people have died from it there's no denying it. It's not as deadly as they are prolagandizing. Fear is the magic bullet for widespread compliance though. It's being used to accelerate the plan for everyone to have a digital ID and for this to be a global thing. Digital currency is something they've wanted to do for a long time. It seems like they want to use the vaccine passport as a gateway to digitalize us. It's not just about the vaccine but that is the entry point. The platform that the vaccine passport would be on would be something they could build on, they could add in everything else about you. All of your health information, your financial information, criminal records, every little detail about you. We are now seeing what going against your government will get you silence, deplatformed, even put in jail. There will come a point when if this digital ID happens you will need it to log on to the internet. You won't have any anonymity like what we have now. Yes I know we are being monitored but it will go to a whole new level. You won't be able to do simple things if you don't behave correctly. Like get a loan, get your kid into the school you want, even call a cab, they could turn your life on and off with a switch like this. I believe that's what they're going for. Sound crazy? I used to think so but I don't anymore. I do think we still have a window where we can fight this but it's narrowing very quickly. They're getting desperate that's why things are accelerating. Go ahead and call me crazy, I don't give a shit I honestly think there's something very nefarious here going on and if people knew the extent of it they would absolutely freak out and Revolt.</p>

        <p><em>Looks around</em> Nope, I see no revolution. I see a LOT of idiots cheering the 'great reset' on &amp; a few on this sub that don't like it, but too few to matter. There wasn't enough to even stop the destruction of numerous businesses. For that matter, the biggest group that did protest joined in to burn &amp; loot businesses! </p>
<p>How burning &amp; looting businesses in their own areas 'gets back at' the government they claim is abusing them is a logic I can't comprehend.</p>
