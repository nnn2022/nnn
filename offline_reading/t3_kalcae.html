        <p>r/conspiracy is heavily brigaded, and has been for some time. When the numbers get significant here, expect the same. </p>
<p>I haven't been there in over a month and it's nice. </p>
<p>The whole sub is full of normies anyway so it defeats the purpose. So the gatekeeping skyrockets because of it. </p>
<p>Coronavirus, it's testing, it's vaccine, or anything related to it is the conspiracy of the day, and nothing else matters right now.</p>

        <p>Modern propaganda is aimed to keep the propaganda in constant conversation... I looked into many readings of very recent propaganda techniques, they don't care as much in proving whether it's real or not anymore.</p>
<p>They just want to keep it front and center, the creator of reddit operates a "PR Firm" and uses the reddit platform as his playground. Every single sub is shilled hard, especially conspiracy and those sub that are supposed to question the propaganda narrative.</p>
<p>The guy is fully on board with communist BLM, covid vaccines, plant based no meat future, dystopian shit... Would be like asking why twitter is allowing 90% of comments to be from bots for covid/mask/blm propaganda, when the founder is a well known socialist and fully on board with the "new normal"</p>

        <p>I'm not so sure it's mostly bots anymore. I work for a major healthcare system and was in a zoom meeting recently with 7 department leaders who are "very excited" about this "historical time for humanity" where the great and all mighty vaccine will be at our location within a week, enough for patients and qualified front line staff. Staff are already signing up to blindly take the injection. Every one of them was praising it and so glad to see it's very near arrival. Absolutely nothing opposing or questioning that view was said and I just sat there dumbfounded. </p>
<p>I get how healthcare leadership wants to keep their patients and staff "safe" from this mean ole virus, but these people are complete brainwashed fools.</p>

        <p>Idk man we're all pretty hype for the vaccine at my lab.
Everyones tired of being stuck inside, im ready to take this vaccine and go to the nastiest bar possible lmao.
Plus having actually studied how that type of vaccine works during my undergrad immunology class, and personally wanting my career to go into gene therapy I think this vaccine is really exciting and could pave way into a whole new types of treatment for various diseases.</p>

        <p>You do realize that most people are excited for the vaccine because they're excited for government restrictions to end, not because they're scared of the virus itself. </p>
<p>Im from New York and know tons of people who have gotten covid. From a 20 year old guy, to a middle aged woman, to a 55 year old man with high blood pressure and diabetes, to an 85 year old woman with dementia and diabetes. I could list many more people but my point is they all had very minor symptoms, usually a stuffy nose and a light cough with some losing taste and smell for a week or so.</p>
<p>No sane person would be concerned with this virus if the CIA media wasn't blasting out propaganda 24/7</p>

        <p>I know a few people that have gotten it too. Most had mild symtoms, except for my uncle (47) and a friend of my girlfriend (25), who both felt extremely sick, but recovered after a few weeks</p>
<p>I agree, most people aren't afraid. Im not, and no one i work with really is. We're afraid for our parents and our kids, but we mainly want the vaccine so we don't have to quarantine anymore.</p>

        <p>No.</p>
<p>The US government just paid a private foreign company millions (billions?) of dollars to quickly give millions of americans this vaccine for <em>free</em></p>
<p>We saw one of the worst depressions this country has seen.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands have died.</p>
<p>Thousands of small businesses went bankrupt.</p>
<p>People are literally plotting to kidnap their governors.</p>
<p>Rudy Giuliani is in the hospital (when he should be managing the orange man's election whatever)</p>
<p>The government has lost a significant amount of public and international trust on the CDC and public health officials, and it won't be gained back for decades</p>
<p>Plus many more shenanigans, and for what?</p>
<p>So people inject themselves with a bit of RNA that enda up metabolized in a few days? What real benefit does the government get from that? They're not even making the vaccine mandatory. Hell, most of the population will have to pay for it, and when they hear the price tag they won't take it. Only old people (mainly in nursing homes) and healthcare workers will get it an probably have it be mandatory. </p>
<p>I just don't see how the government benefits from this. The predecedent it will establish won't be anymore significant than for example the TB vaccine or the Measels vaccine. Now those two had loongg vaccine lines.</p>
