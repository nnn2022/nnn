    <strong>How is it that no one questions how nursing homes have been infected?</strong>
    <p><p>I just read another post here on this sub, the person claiming his mom was in a nursing home where supposedly most of the residents caught the virus and eight died. How did that happen? Those people are the most isolated. They don't go out. No one can visit them. Only the staff has contact with them. And surely the staff of these facilities are properly wearing masks and taking all precautions. So how did it spread there?</p>
<p>It tells me that the lockdowns and masks are worthless. They don't work.</p>
<p>Here in my county, a few months ago, the news gleefully, disgustingly,  ran a story of how our cases doubled. Way down in the article, it was mentioned that ALL the new cases were in one nursing home. Again, how did that happen? Of course the redditors on the local sub were quick to blame stupid Trump supporters, and idiot anti-maskers. Except no one had contact with the people in that facility except staff. Lockdowns and masks didn't protect these people.</p>
<p>And my best friend, he has a father in another long term care home in Canada - home of extreme lockdowns. Dying of Alzheimer's. Not allowed to see him. His father is dying alone and confused, not even allowed the comfort of a familiar face. That in itself is a gross violation of all decency. And yet, that facility also had the virus go through it. His father tested positive.</p>
<p>How? How can anyone think lockdowns and masks work at all? How can anyone defend this?</p>
<p>I can understand if you were worried in February or March of last year. But now? After everything we've seen, or not seen? </p>
<p>If you still defend any of this - this cruelty, this callous, inhumane treatment of people, this assuming that everyone is a walking disease factory... You're sick. Even though I disagreed, I used to understand you. I used to feel bad for you. But now, after all the evidence is in?</p>
<p>If you're still defending any of this bullshit, it's for ideological reasons. You've made it part of your identity. And that's just sick and pathetic.</p></p>

        <p>Do you not understand how contagious illnesses spread? In Nursing homes they’re damn near stacked on top of each other, with treatment by CNAs being as close and personal as it gets. </p>
<p>Masks will help mitigate the spread but it’s not an end all solution.</p>
<p>Think critically guy.</p>

        <p>Yes, they slow the spread from 100% relative speed, all the way down to 100%.</p>
<p>Kind of like if your car had a brake pedal that, instead of engaging the brakes, just lit up an idiot light that said "you are now slowing down, and a good person for doing it."</p>
