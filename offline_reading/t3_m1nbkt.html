    <strong>Conspiracy post: China - WHO missing link</strong>
    <p><p>Trying to find a starting point of research to find out what connections exist from China to the WHO that would prove its power over them. The last I checked, China wasnt the highest donor to the WHO. What i do know is China is the #1 country staged for the 4th industrial revolution and will become the new global super power. Is it this reason alone the WHO and other organizations are covering China for things like the Wuhan leak, Uyghers, etc.?</p>
<p>I recently learned from the WHO whisteblower that Gates and other high powered people in the WHO/UN have complete diplomatic immunity and protection under their charters. For those interested on that, you can watch here : https://coercioncode.com/2021/03/08/who-insider-blows-whistle-on-gates-and-gavi-unicef-video/</p>
<p>Is it again just purely Gates and others directing WHO investigations away from China because they are preparing for the 4th industrial/Great Reset?</p>
<p>Any leads would be appreciated.</p></p>
