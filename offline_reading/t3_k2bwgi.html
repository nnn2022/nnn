    <strong>Ireland just had a 6 year old give her teddy bear a COVID vaccine on national TV</strong>
    <p><p>Exactly as the title says. Every year almost every person in Ireland tunes in to watch "The Late Late Toy Show". It's just a program before Christmas to show off all the new toys to kids. Well, this year they spent the first half just talking about COVID and how Christmas will be different this year, bla bla bla.</p>
<p>Then the 6-year-old girl appears with her teddy bear and injects it with a fake covid-19 vaccine on national TV broadcast to hundreds of thousands of children around the country. She also knocks the teddy out with a fake hammer because it wasn't willingly taking the vaccine.</p>
<p>How the fuck does anyone think this is not propaganda?</p></p>

Child abuse is child abuse, and telling your son, daughter "your going to go to hell if you do not do a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z - then you will BURN IN HELL" - is child abuse. Fuck you and religion.</p>

        <p>gotta get them young.</p>
<p>if you don't mind control/program them before a certain age, then it gets really really hard, if not impossible.</p>
<p>that is why you got trauma based mind control in hospital births, that is why everything gets done to break the mother child connection.</p>
<p>that is why they are trying to remove the children as early as possible from families and throw them into government indoctrination centers called public schools  or nurseries.</p>
<p>and THAT propaganda is also why you got this child following a script on tv pushing their poison injections and  prison time for people (forced isolation = prison).</p>
<p>using children in your propaganda also has other benefits outside of  being a lot more appealing to children of course.</p>
<p>using a child means, that anyone attacking the propaganda RIGHGTFULLY might get wrongly seen as someone attacking the child. greta thunberg the front person for the co2 based climate based myth movement  is a great example. she also gets bonus points,  for having aspergers, so everyone who attacks the HUGE media campaign around her may wrongfully get called someone, who attacks children and children  with disabilities or something like that.</p>
<p>one certainly can't have the people actually behind such propaganda as the front people of the propaganda, if you want to appeal to children.</p>
<p>i mean if children see this:</p>
<p><a href="https://vosizneias.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/soros.jpg">https://vosizneias.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/soros.jpg</a>  (george soros)</p>
<p>they would probably want to run rather than listen to anything :D</p>
<p>so showing this child on TV performing  covid-19 propaganda is just very calculated propaganda. </p>
<p>how do we fix this problem then? protect our children from  trauma based mind control and indoctrination centers. this means home births or  non shit birthing centers, rather than extremely harmful now openly torturing (through masks) hospitals.</p>
<p>it means, protecting the genitals of our children from mutilation, which sadly happens to way to many children with horrible life long consequences and deaths for some even.</p>
<p>NOT giving our children away into government indoctrination centers. that is a really big one!</p>
<p>so homeschooling, unschooling or proper loving private schools. remember you are already VASTLY more qualified to teach your child than anyone else, because you care about your child way beyond anyone else.</p>
<p>and of course protecting the children from TV programming and other media.</p>
<p>i don't mean, to not show them movies and other media, but not TV filled with propaganda and other shit. you can have your own vast media library to show your child age appropriate wonderful pieces of art, rather than indoctrinate them into slavery as this TV advertisement did.</p>
<p>instead of the TV propaganda you could watch a movie like princess mononoke together. an animation classic. point being, that you need to protect your child from all of this propaganda.</p>
<p>you HAVE TO protect them form public indoctrination centers called public schools and you have to protect them from TV propaganda. </p>
<p>hell even if you want your child to have something to watch for 10 hours straight one day, because you are to stressed out to do anything anymore and want some rest, then YOU should control what media this is, rather than having your kids hypnotized by tablets running the "children's youtube app" or TV pushing forced poison injections.</p>

        <p>This is exactly what we do with our 3 yrs old. People always compliment his temperament. You can easily see what is negatively impact your child if you PAY ATTENTION to their shift in behavior. Sometimes something he's watching overstimulates him, even when it's wholesome. I shut it off and give him something else to do manually without screens and he's fine.</p>

        <p>wonderful :)</p>
<p>btw have you done your research on vaccines in general?</p>
<p>i've heard to many stories of wonderful children having their lives destroyed by vaccines, so i'm just mentioned it.</p>
<p>research showing harm including developmental delays on children vaccines:</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2050312120925344">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2050312120925344</a> </p>
<p>quite some different little humans we get, when we keep them free of government influence, overstimulation from some things like you mention and neurological harm from vaccines and just love them and protect them.  ٩(⁎❛ᴗ❛⁎)۶</p>

        <p>Yes I have. In fact, when my wife and I got together she mentioned she researched vaccines a little after we met. She was shocked, lol. Made taking her down the rabbit hole a little easier, she was primed  ; ). By the time our son was born we knew which direction we wanted to take. He was a water birth by an experienced mid wife of 20 yrs. No vaccines, only a vitamin k shot because he had a blood clot in his eye. All natural shot. I was also the first to touch him and that has payed off tremendously. We sat in the sun 15 minutes after I cut his cord. Nothing but breast milk too. Listened to classical music on the way home. </p>
<p>I'm actually already following you from a very informative 4 part post I read last night but I appreciate the additional links. : )</p>
<p>Oh and Happy thanksgiving!!!</p>

        <p>Can I just say this is my new favorite comment?! 
I had 3 of my 4 kids at home. None have been vaccinated, circumcised or in any other way mutilated or harmed by the medical industry, they're unschooled, and we don't own a TV at all. They are the most well rounded, curious, un-indoctrinated kids I've ever met. Of course I'm slightly biased... But they have much more confidence, creativity and curiosity about the world than most other kids I know, and they could care less if people give them dirty looks for not wearing masks. They know they are useless and unnecessary and they will not give in to "peer" pressure even when it's their beloved grandparents telling them they should follow the rules and wear their masks in public... 
Anyway, I was glad to read your comment and all the awesome things you also believe about raising children FREE from the propaganda and government indoctrination.</p>

        <p>Yep, if they research it themselves and want to go get a bunch of shots, they can go right ahead. I doubt it'll happen though. My husband and I frequently debate things like vaccines, masks, lockdowns, ThE sCiEnCe, etc and our kids are very aware of both sides of these debates.
 At this point in their lives they have no desire to ever be vaccinated or cowed into wearing a mask or anything else they deem would not be good for their health. And I won't force them either way. Bodily autonomy.</p>

<p>They have always been endeavoring to brainwash children especially in those formative years which establishes an engrained behavior. This video is one of the most conspicuous efforts I've seen. Not only is it limited to the brainwashing and spreading of propaganda but it is inciting violence into these kids by programming them that those who resist will be met with the use of such violence. </p>

        <p>I mean we know she was coached... but it's obvious she was coached. I think?</p>
<p>She's nervous, going by body language, but she doesn't really hesitate in what she says. If she was so nervous about being on tv, in front of strangers etc, she'd need more time to think of answers. But she doesn't miss a beat, so she's got it prepared ahead of time. So I assume she's nervous because she's trying to remember her lines.</p>

        <p>This makes it worse for me. Every child in the country dreams of being on the toy show, and this kid's parents/RTE ruined it for her. Instead of just letting her enjoy herself on the show and be a kid, she was probably sat down and told about the pfizer vaccine and HSE backlogs and then her little quip about schools at the end of the clip. I can't imagine how insufferable her parents have to be for a six year old to know any of this, let alone talk about it on the toy show.</p>

        <p>This video is all kinds of weird. She clearly super uncomfortable, swaying, and fumbling. The guy with the deer antler headband is creepy. The rabbit gets pushed off a pretend cliff. The dogs have to be contact traced. Goodness. It's bad enough to have to give the dog a Covid vaccine, but it was super unnecessary to have to hit it over the head with a hammer for not wanting to participate in the vaccine... It's borderline an Elsagate type video.</p>

        <p>This was really disturbing to watch. She’s obviously so nervous to not mess up- what kind of pressure did her parents put her under? Smh. Yeah, the guy in the antlers is kind of creepy too... I guess he has to stand 6 feet away from her probably which makes the interview seem more awkward.</p>
