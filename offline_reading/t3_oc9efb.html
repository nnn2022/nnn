    <strong>On Malaysia's mask mandates and lockdown decrees.</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li><strong>Mask mandates.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When the pandemic reached our shores in March '20 masks were optional, but people wore them out of a "sense of caution", despite some mask boxes clearly stating that they don't block C-19 viruses. But since August wearing a mask is mandatory. But did it stop the infections? Compare the infection numbers, and make your own conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>2. Lockdown decrees.</strong></p>
<p>We're currently in the <strong>3rd edition</strong> of lockdown. The <strong>1st edition</strong> between March and June 2020 was arguably the most successful, since the daily case counts back then were very low if compared to today, and did not exceed 300. The <strong>2nd edition</strong> came just after Christmas, forcing the cancellation of Chinese New Year celebrations. That was when cases rose to 5,000.</p>
<p>But there is selective enforcement of what the government called "standard operating procedures", or what I call, "decrees" that did more to inconvenience businesses than actually prevent new infections.</p>
<p>When someone in the regime got caught violating the decrees, it was always a slap on the wrist, a short warning, or investigations that doesn't seem to end. When the common people or small businesses got caught doing that, it was always a MYR 5,000 (USD 1,200) fine, or higher, or at one point, jail time (though jail is no longer meted out due to concerns of overcrowding in prisons).</p>
<p>So, yes, "rules for thee but not for me". It seems we're not alone on this (cf. Gov. Whitmer (US), Matt Hancock (UK) etc.) It was never about "controlling the spread"; it was about political control.</p></p>
