    <strong>What do you believe the government wants from the lockdown restrictions?</strong>
    <p><p>Its a genuine question, what do you think they want? Do they want the economy to be destroyed so they get less money? Do they want their whole country inside and living in fear because they.. crave power? I'm just not sure what you believe they're doing this for other than to protect people's lives and family.</p></p>

        <p>If you have any doubts, look who benefitted from the lockdowns. Follow the money. Big banks, corporations, and pharmaceutical companies nearly doubled and tripled their revenue.</p>
<p>Thats a common misconception that if they destroy the economy, there will be less money and therefore the government and big corps will get less money. </p>
<p>The truth is that all it does is concentrate wealth further up the chain because small to midsize competitors bust and only the largest companies survive. They recieve bailouts and tax breaks as a result of swimming in the DC swamp so for them it is a good trade to constrict the economy in order to beat out their competitors. Over a longer period of time theyll make up for their losses by having a monopoly. </p>
<p>Its also incredibly naieve to think government doesnt use crisis to increase power. That is literally the entire history of civilization. The US itself was organized in a way that assumes government will try to increase power over time, which is why there is a constitution and seperate branches of government among other features.</p>

        <p>But what is this power that you think they have now that they didn't before? Do you think they will have the power to randomly impose restrictions on everyone and force us to stay inside? They could do that before anyway. There's absolutely no difference that they have in power after this pandemic than they did before.</p>

        <p>I dont see your point here. Thats like saying if I was a 240 pound musclehead and I had the power to rape a 90 pound woman. Then one day I rape a woman, and you say, what is the difference? He had that power before. Theres no difference. The point is that I have now crossed a line and exercised my power in a way that is harmful and destructive. And for that I must be held accountable for my actions. </p>
<p>I want to live in a world where government is held accountable for their actions and the people have a say. Right now in Canada there are religious leaders in jail for having church in their house. But you will say, but they broke restrictions. Well, if government can get you to go along with anything during an emergency, then there will always be an emergency. </p>
<p>Its the oldest play in the book. Even the romans would engineer false crises to get people to go to war or do some other thing they would normally not go along with.</p>
