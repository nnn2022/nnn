        <p>The pharma companies created COVID in the first place. They've deliberately caused something like five million deaths worldwide, at least if you trust the worldwide COVID numbers.</p>
<p>Why the hell would you trust the COVID vaccines?</p>

        <p>For who? Everyone? The people running the show want to limit the population of earth to 500,000,000 people, as per the georgia guidestones. 
They don't want any more generations to deal with. They want the pleb humans to fizzle out while they have their super unaging bodies to explore the galaxy with. 
2046 is the event.... everything has to be in place by then. Ever see anything happening after 2050?</p>

        <p>I remember seeing a post on here about three days ago that looked at how much death rates in countries that had a lot of vaccination decreased since the vaccines came out, and compared it to how much death rates in countries that didn't have a lot of vaccinations decreased.</p>
<p>The answer: there was no statistically significant difference.</p>
<p>COVID is dying out because of warmer weather and increasing herd immunity by past infection.</p>
<p>The vaccines are getting fictional credit for what's happening naturally.</p>

        <p>Here immunity includes anyone who is protected against getting and spreading the virus. Anyone who has already has Covid, individuals on prophylactic Ivermectin, and children are also contributors to heard immunity. The vaccinated are only one subset.</p>
