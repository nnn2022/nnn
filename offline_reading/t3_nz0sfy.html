    <strong>Virology/epidemiology are not the only types of science that can/should be used to shape public policy, and not having a PhD in one of those fields does not disqualify you from having an educated opinion regarding pandemic measures</strong>
    <p><p>COVID cultists love to shut down anyone who questions the narrative by claiming that they should blindly trust those in the medical establishment and the government. They always say something like this: </p>
<p>"Where is your doctorate in virology? Don't have one? Shut up then! You can't have an opinion on anything." </p>
<p>This is one of the least educated takes they could make regarding this topic. Virology and epidemiology obviously play a role in the pandemic response, but so do "soft sciences" that often are overlooked and devalued in favor of STEM fields.</p>
<p>One does not need a PhD in virology to assess trends regarding the consolidation of power among the elite or the slow march towards authoritarianism that is occurring right now. </p>
<p>Anyone who has studied economics, political science, law, history, criminology, psychology, or a number of other subjects can hold an informed opinion on what is happening right now. </p>
<p>Anyone with a pair of eyes and ears can tell that this pandemic has led to an unprecedented level of consolidation of wealth and power. </p>
<p>The wealthy have gotten wealthier, the poor got poorer, and Big Business was able to avoid arbitrary pandemic measures at the expense of small businesses that were unable to play by the same rules. </p>

<p>Now, I don't profess to have anything past a layman's knowledge of how COVID, vaccines, masks, or anything else works. I don't spend my days in a white coat and a hazmat suit performing gain-of-function experiments in a BSL-4 lab. </p>
<p>And guess what? I don't need to know every last detail of how those things work to explain why one should not trust what is happening right now. </p>
<p>Our government has a long and storied history of behaving unethically at pretty much every opportunity it gets. When you look at the medical side of that history, you won't like what you see. </p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States </p>
<p>Our healthcare system is designed to maximize profit, not provide quality care for those afflicted with disease or infirmity. </p>
<p>The companies responsible for researching, developing, and producing our treatments are some of the shadiest and least-trustworthy organizations around. </p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_pharmaceutical_settlements </p>
<p>Many of them have been proven to engage in deceptive practices such as manipulating research to show their goods in a favorable manner, offering kickbacks to doctors to push their product, and knowingly selling dangerous substances to the public. </p>
<p>For example, Purdue Pharmaceuticals was nearly single-handedly responsible for the Opioid Epidemic that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives in the US. They intentionally misled the public about the risks of their product, and created a population dependent on their drug to function. </p>
<p>https://harvardpolitics.com/big-pharma/ </p>
<p>The companies that produce the vaccines are not shining examples of ethical behavior either. </p>
<p>Pfizer - https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-largest-health-care-fraud-settlement-its-history </p>
<p>AstraZeneca - https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/pharmaceutical-giant-astrazeneca-pay-520-million-label-drug-marketing </p>
<p>J&amp;J - https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/johnson-johnson-pay-more-22-billion-resolve-criminal-and-civil-investigations </p>
<p>Moderna has never produced a vaccine or drug that received FDA approval. They are a relatively new company with no track record of success. Do with that information what you will. </p>
<p>https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/17/947628608/how-will-moderna-meet-the-demand-for-its-covid-19-vaccine </p>
<p>https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-moderna-the-covid-vaccine-front-runner-with-no-track-record-and-an-unsparing-ceo-11593615205 </p>
<p>These institutions and companies should have zero control over us. All of the laws, mandates, regulations, and whatnot that have come along as a result of the pandemic must be eliminated. </p>
<p>Time and time again, these organizations have lost the public trust. There is zero reason to believe that they are not deceiving us now when they have frequently done so in the past and there are major incentives for them to do so in the present. </p>
<p>It must be noted that the officials that craft these new rules that we are bound by do not personally follow them. The everyday person suffers, but the elite do not. </p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/democratic-politicians-who-violated-covid-19-rules-guidance-list-2020-12?op=1#house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-8 </p>
<p>Folks, if the people who write the rules do not live by them, you are being played. </p>
<p>We are being told by the elites that we must sacrifice for the "greater good," but they will not do so themselves. </p>
<p>Just like has happened in every other authoritarian state, "the greater good" is being used as a weapon to strip the citizens of their autonomy and freedoms. </p>
<p>This weaponization of morality is abominable. The public has been taught that capability, self-sufficiency, and autonomy are sinful, and that dependence, weakness, subservience and coerced/forced sacrifice are noble. </p>
<p>We are seeing propaganda used to manipulate the minds of our fellow citizens. We are taught that opinions that dissent from the media narrative are illegitimate and not worthy of discussion. Often, we are told that they are outright dangerous and should be attacked. </p>
<p>https://www.ntu.ac.uk/about-us/news/news-articles/2021/01/expert-blog-covid-propaganda-understanding-the-communications-surrounding-the-coronavirus-vaccine </p>
<p>The use of weaponized fear has led to a substantial portion of the population being unable to discern reality from fiction. </p>
<p>According to a Gallup poll, "Forty-one percent of Democrats and 28 percent of Republicans answered that half or more of those infected by COVID-19 need to be hospitalized." </p>
<p>The true number of hospitalizations is somewhere in the range of 1 to 5 percent. </p>
<p>Amongst Republicans (who often are less exposed to this fearmongering,) "26% correctly identified the risk compared to just 10% of Democrats." </p>
<p>https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-misinformation-is-distorting-covid-policies-and-behaviors/ </p>
<p>Given this irrational belief regarding the lethality of the virus, it is easy to see why so many people are easily spooked by COVID and want stricter measures to prevent it. </p>
<p>The study found that "those who overestimate risks to young people or hold an exaggerated sense of risk upon infection are more likely to favor closing schools, restaurants, and other businesses." </p>
<p>Many of our peers are accepting of this New Normal because they have been flat-out lied to by the media. </p>
<p>They have been manipulated into living in a state of constant paranoia over a disease that statistically is not dangerous to the vast majority of people. </p>
<p>When you live in a constant state of fear, you cannot think rationally. Our countrymen are being taught to view those of us with dissenting views as evil threats to the lives of the righteous and innocent. </p>
<p>One way for propaganda to influence public opinion is for it "to make an apparently credible attribution of evil intent to the “enemy” or “out-group" while simultaneously strengthening positive feelings such as pride, altruism, and empathy amongst the in-group." </p>
<p>Do we not see this constantly in media, both traditional and social? Do we not see a constant barrage of hatred towards those who question the narrative? Do we not see the ascribing of virtue to those who obey it unquestioningly? </p>
<p>The end result is that "the attribution of evildoing to the enemy will tend to induce hate and vengefulness in the in-group, and the attribution of evil intent will tend to induce fear." </p>
<p>If it is permitted to go unchecked for long enough, "this hatred will cause the in-group to regard retaliation as just and the fear will cause deportation or extinction as necessary." </p>
<p>We can see this happening right now. Our governments are using fear and hatred of the out-group to push forward authoritarian measures such as segregation, the concept of guilty-until-proven-innocent, arbitrary shutdown of business, disregard for bodily autonomy, and lockdowns that never would have been accepted under normal circumstances. </p>
<p>This use of propaganda is not original. It is employed frequently by those in power to convince the in-group that they are at risk from the out-group, and therefore must cede their freedoms and autonomy to the government that will fix the problem. </p>
<p>Once this hatred and fear reaches a certain level, the in-group will be willing to permit every manner of evil to occur. </p>
<p>The current dehumanization of those who do not adhere to pandemic measures echoes that which occurred during the years of the Third Reich. </p>
<p>During that era, "portrayal of the Jews as disease-spreading rats feeding off the host nation, poisoning its culture and polluting the Aryan race triggered feelings of hate and vengefulness in the ethnic German population." </p>
<p>We have seen this frequently during the pandemic. Those in opposition to emergency measures are often termed "plague rats" and told that they should be exterminated to keep the nation "clean." </p>
<p>We also hear frequently that those who do not get vaccinated are freeloaders who benefit from herd immunity without having to sacrifice personally, which further contributes to the idea that they should be despised. </p>
<p>There is a concerted effort to portray those who question the narrative as psychopathic evildoers who want to harm all that is good and wholesome. </p>
<p>The same types of propaganda that were used to demonize the Jewish population of Germany are being employed now to demonize members of the new out-group. </p>
<p>Just as the Nazi Party used this fear and hatred of the "other" to consolidate power and harm enemies, the current establishment is manipulating the hearts and minds of many of our countrymen to get them to willingly cede power to authority and oppress those who will not be complicit in their machinations. </p>
<p>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201811/propaganda-and-hoaxes-in-nazi-germany-80-years-later </p>
<p>One does not need an advanced degree in virology or epidemiology and an Ivy League fellowship to see where this is going. </p>
<p>The consolidation of wealth/power, forced/coerced blind faith in unethical institutions, the weaponization of "empathy," and the blatant and constant use of fear and hate-based propaganda is pointing us in the direction of authoritarianism. </p>
<p>The parallels to prior authoritarian regimes are striking and clear. </p>
<p>If we do not protest it now, our descendants will be looking back at the history books and wondering how we ever could have let it get that bad, just as we look back at the antebellum South or Nazi Germany and wonder how everyday people sat idly by and let such evil happen.</p>
<p>Do not let people belittle and dismiss you because you do not hold whatever arbitrary credentials they use to gatekeep discussion. Anyone with a pair of eyes and ears can tell what is happening right now. </p>
<p>Be the change you want to see in the world. If you want to live in a more ethical society, work to make it happen.</p>
<p>Contact your representatives and tell them that you do not agree with what is going on, and that you will be rallying support for their opponents should they not do anything about it. </p>
<p>Go out and protest these changes. Organize peaceful events and show that not everyone agrees with pandemic measures. </p>
<p>Organize boycotts of businesses that attempt to coerce adherence to pandemic measures that violate bodily autonomy or individual liberty. </p>
<p>Reach out to the people in your life and change their minds and hearts. If you can show even one person the truth, you have already done a damn fine job. </p>
<p>Talk to them at a personal level - show them that normal, decent, kind-hearted people that they trust and love oppose these mandates. </p>
<p>Show them that there are more people opposed to this power grab than just the raving lunatics the media highlights and demonizes. </p>
<p>Change starts with you. If you do not want a New Normal, it is incumbent upon you to act ethically and change hearts, minds, and hopefully policy. We still have a chance to stop authoritarianism - let's make the most of it.</p></p>
