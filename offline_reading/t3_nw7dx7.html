    <strong>"How can we prevent these ignorant and selfish people from spreading disease?"</strong>
    <p><p>We had a session in my workplace about covid protocol with the HR and someone asked this question with regards to the "unvaccinated" heathens. This got many nods (or rather, "likes") from others. </p>
<p>Um, what? </p>
<p>Does this question remind you of anything?</p>
<p>Something something Germany something something 1930's.....</p></p>

        <p>i geuss they did not figured out that their vaccine protects them from "ignorant selfish people" like us yet.
maybe we are ignorant in their eyes, but they clearly lack intelligence and common sense.</p>

        <p>An truly astonishing number of vaccinated people don’t seem to understand how vaccines work. I just read a couple FB comments section on the Los Angeles NBC and ABC news pages about the state opening up next week &amp; vaccinated people being allowed to go unmasked (it will be an honor system, no one will have to show their papers).. Every vaccinated sheep said the same thing—they will continue to wear their mask because they don’t trust antivaxxers to wear a mask! When asked why they need a mask if their vaccine works, they said “you don’t know how vaccines work”.</p>

        <p>It has become a political issue so for both sides there are those who wear it or don't wear it because it is part of their tribe.  They don't understand the reasoning behind it and that is honestly a fact of life.  And also public communication is hard and if you try to convey any nuance it gets quickly lost, so you tend to hear very simple general rules since they are easy to understand and follow.  If the CDC came out and actually tried to communicate the nuances of the mask issue it would be a disaster in that everyone would likely take whatever they wanted to from it.</p>

        <p>The minute they started this bullshit about how a mask protects others, I knew we were headed toward massive division. I’ll be honest, I was hopeful that with the vaccine people would finally chill. Nope, here were are divided even more where they somehow think others getting the vax will somehow save a random fat ass alcoholic in Delaware who has a heart condition.</p>

        <p>HR is full of useless degenerate scum people. Leftist faglets in the workplace collect bunch of likes, because their view is supported by the mainstream narrative, so they're not afraid to speak out. The silent majority is just in silence, but if we all unified together, they would quickly cower in their faggitty safe places.</p>

        <p>It was not the whole world vs 1 county.  Many places took on 3 countries. (Germany, Italy and Japan)</p>
<p>Also the war occurred because Germany started to invade other countries.  In fact the world was willing to look the other way after Germany invaded Czechoslovakia.  Germans got greedy and went after more places and then war started.</p>
<p>As for the vaccine being the best thing to do, well why does that include discriminating and segregating those that don't want it?  How about those that have had corona and got over it and developed immunity, they get discriminated against too.  No this is quickly turning into making rules and policies out of hatred and dislike for people.</p>

        <p>Just so you know as well Germany in 1930’s didn’t openly have those views that you’re talking about outside the Nazi Party the people voted them in because Hitler made them believe he would continue the work he had started to repair the economy from the First World War. Most German civilians had no idea what was actually going on until we’ll into the 1940’s and by then it was too late. Propaganda is a powerful tool and nobody in this “era” seems to have learnt their lesson from our own history.</p>

<p>You don’t think governments do certain things for financial gain among other reasons ahead of the well being of their populations? </p>

        <p>I'm sure governments often prioritise finances over other things. But they implemented a lockdown at huge financial and political cost to themselves. In the UK, the government is being blamed for the lockdown and it may well cost them the next election. So, if that's their plan, it's a pretty bad plan.</p>
<p>And the governments haven't developed a vaccine. Medical experts, and companies who are experts in vaccine production have. They've been tested. They've received multiple authorisations and approvals in many countries. They've received the green light from many independent organisations as well, who have zero ties to the government.</p>
<p>So, those are the people I trust. I trust them every day. If I get hit by a car, I trust them to fix my problems. If I have a headache, I trust that they've made the paracetamol correctly. I listen to when they suggest healthy diets. I don't say "I'm not letting you dictate what I eat", I say "you're the experts" and I eat more green stuff.</p>
<p>I trust them with the vaccines that have been given to hundreds of millions of people. I trust the mRNA technology that isn't new. Its really old. It's been used for countless other things before this vaccine.</p>
<p>I trust the vaccines that aren't mRNA, because that technology has been around for 50+ years. The number of reported problems is absolutely tiny.</p>
<p>I even trust the Astra vaccine that can cause blood clots, because the risk is so tiny. The risk of women taking a contraceptive pill is 4 times higher for blood clots, and people still take that happily.</p>
<p>In life, sometimes, blind trust is needed. I trust my dentist. I trust the plumber and electrician who say I need work done. I trust the doctor. I'm not an expert so I trust the experts.</p>
<p>Their current guidance is for everyone to get vaccinated and I have no reason whatsoever to refuse or mistrust them.</p>

        <p>I would argue that governments are not losing money because of lockdowns. Small businesses are. Large corporations are still open, everything that involves this level of government is deemed essential and has not stopped. I would also say that people in these governments don’t care about the government in itself. They are getting paid regardless. We could also get into another debate about who really runs these countries because if you’ve noticed it doesn’t matter who is in the chair the show goes on uninterrupted. But there is already a lot to unpack here as it is and I don’t want to go on too many tangents.</p>
<p>As for the idea of trust, I get where you are coming from and I agree that there is lots of instances in life where we blindly put trust into people. But at the end of the day not everyone has our best interests in mind. People make mistakes, people are bias, people are pressured to take certain positions, people lie, the list goes on. </p>
<p>Medical experts can have these qualities too. They are not free from those just because they study medicine. Doctors have misdiagnosed plenty in the past. It’s actually one of the highest causes of death in the US. These so called medical experts constantly push drugs on people to tackle symptoms and don’t treat underlying causes too. Some are paid to push certain things. Like I said before these issues are so much more complicated.</p>
<p>The vaccines are still undergoing trials and haven’t been fully tested, and no long term studies can even possibly have been done. So there is that. Just because they have been authorized says zero about their safety. How many things has organizations like the FDA approved that have turned out to be bad for us?</p>
<p>So the issue lies in making things mandatory. If you have reached the conclusion from people you trust that you feel you should take it then that’s all good. Do you. Nobody is telling you not to. You can’t expect everybody to reach your same conclusion and be comfortable with that, so those who don’t should not be forced to take it. Especially if you want to talk numbers about problems from vaccines being “tiny”. I don’t necessarily agree with that and there are some factors being overlooked here but by that same logic the danger of “Covid” is also a very small number. So at the end of the day survival rates are high for the disease and the vaccine, so I think it’s up to the individual to access the risk and not a governing agency or an expert. I’m fine with an expert giving advice and making suggestions like a good doctor should, but you should never be forced to take ANY medical procedure. (To be clear I am not even sure if that is your position, I don’t think it was mentioned)</p>

        <p>I actually don't believe people should be forced to have a vaccine either.</p>
<p>I'm pro vaccine, and I encourage people and from being on this sub, I genuinely haven't heard a single legit reason not to have it, other than the slightly childish view of "I don't want to".</p>
<p>I happen to believe that people should want to have it.</p>
<p>There are massive advantages and tiny disadvantages. I could list loads but as a headline, if you get the vaccine, then you're protected against variants, you're protected better than natural immunity, you're helping to remove restrictions quicker because governments are likely to use the vaccinated % as a guide, and you're encouraging others to get it done too, and they may need it more than you.</p>
<p>There's also this thing of the vaccine stops you spreading it if you happen to get it without knowing so it keeps people around you safe as well, but I know people on here tend to disbelieve that and although I believe it, there probably isn't enough studies yet.</p>
<p>And as a price for all that good stuff, you just need to take this vaccine that carries no greater risk than covid does, so you actually haven't lost anything or taken a higher risk. You're basically in the same position but you've gained all that good stuff above.</p>
<p>So, I can't see a logical reason to turn it down.</p>
<p>So, I would hope that every person would want the vaccine willingly. I know that's naive. People love conspiracies. I get it.</p>
<p>If someone refuses for whatever reason, then I do agree with you, they shouldn't be forced.</p>
<p>In the same way that people are free to believe in Aliens, and free to believe the Queen is a lizard, and free to believe in horoscopes and ghosts and Bill Gates wants to microchip you, and all that stuff, people can do what they like.</p>
<p>I do, however, think that society will change, and make it more inconvenient for the non vaccinated. Just like it did for smoking. It banned it in pubs, clubs, restaurants, planes, buses, and in workplaces, you had to go stand in a smoking zone.</p>
<p>Society will do that for anti vaxxers soon. They will be denied access to sporting events (already happening in the UK), denied access onto planes, denied employment, denied health insurance, etc.</p>

        <p>Is it ever nice to have a reasonable logical discussion with someone even if there are things we disagree on. Mad respect for that. </p>
<p>Personally I don’t think disagreeing with the current direction of the world can be fully chalked up to “people like a good conspiracy”. I think a lot of these situations are more grey than that. All societies deal with propaganda, and agendas of the “Elite” for lack of a better word. By that I mean whoever it is that’s actually makes grand shakeups of peoples lifestyles. Wether that be a government or beyond. Every society is subjected to these techniques and it’s not so easy to parse out what’s objective truth and what has ulterior motives behind it. </p>
<p>Just to use an example you mentioned “Bill Gates wanting to microchip you”. Now for me personally I don’t think Bill Gates himself has that as a personal goal. But looking at the big picture lots of Pets are already microchipped. Personally my thoughts on pet ownership and what we do to them falls into the realm of abuse. This is a whole different can of worms but my point being we do things to them against their will. We restrict their freedoms for the convenience of our own lives and in most cases this is not right. Now there is already some people who have been microchipped. This was their decision and that’s fine. But is it really crazy to think that at some point the governments of the world will see this as a good idea for them and eventually push it on society much like we are seeing with the vaccine passports? So it will eventually get to a point where like you mentioned about the vaccines, they will make life difficult without one. I’m sure that if it comes to that they will sell a “justified” reason and use the media to Instil fear into the population to get chipped. It will be for our own “safety” and the pros will outweigh the cons. See where I am going with this, how this is a dangerous road to go down?</p>
<p>Where we do agree is that this stuff shouldn’t be mandatory, but you see how they are making it mandatory without explicitly making it mandatory. This is a soft coercion. </p>
<p>So it seems you are willing to accept these things happening because you believe the overall good outweighs the negative I assume?</p>
<p>I guess my question would be where is your line in the sand? Because I think we agree that certain freedoms are being revoked here, or at the very least they are being held hostage, until we agree to their terms. </p>
<p>For me personally this is going too far and I would prefer to draw the line here, especially because of the tactics being used. Holding rights hostage/soft coercion/ even bribery offering people money, weed, alcohol, incentives etc to get vaccinated. If you ask me if most people seen this Covid situation as a huge risk then they wouldn’t have to be bribed into protecting themselves from it. All these freedoms that have been put on hold, there isn’t even a guarantee that we are getting those back either. It’s another situation where people are working off of faith in people that lie to us on a daily basis. Even if you believe medical professionals about the medical side of all this, they are not the people restricting freedoms. this gets into a whole other aspect of this whole thing. This is why I say these matters are grey and nuanced. </p>
<p>For me personally I don’t have any faith in these institutions. Even if you say you trust the medical professionals which I have my issues with, even giving them the benefit of the doubt there is a laundry list of issues I still have with this whole situation</p>

        <p>See, this argument does come up a lot and I have problems with it. I'll accept that people are different personality types so I don't expect my opinion to be shared.</p>
<p>But on the whole restricting freedoms thing - I'm not really sure what people mean.</p>
<p>So, for a start, I don't particularly understand the big outrage about privacy these days either. People complain that Google track you online, and there's loads of programs to remove cookies and have a VPN and hide your activity online. I've never understand that. What on earth are people doing that you think anyone would care?</p>
<p>Even if they make money selling that data to advertisers, why do you care? At worst, you'll get targeted ads. So? You're getting ads anyway, what's the difference? </p>
<p>It's a similar story with DNA. I've seen posts on here from people outraged that the government has your DNA or facial imprint or fingerprints or retina scans. I've never understood the problem. What do you think they'll do with them? They clearly collect them for crime fighting reasons which sounds a pretty good reason to me.</p>
<p>I know you didn't mention those two things but I bring them up as an example of stuff that doesn't really matter. It doesn't really impact you. Your data gets collected, maybe sold, people maybe track what you do online and you get some ads and that's about it. It doesn't really impact you, or cost you anything or harm you in any way. </p>
<p>Since you brought up microchipping, let's say people got microchipped as a way of monitoring health. A chip could regulate something or monitor blood pressure or heart rate or glucose or whatever. There would be a benefit. The trade off might be that they collect data or even track your location but again, its always anonymised and I can't see how it matters. Why would anyone really care that I went to work, went shopping, went out for dinner and came home?</p>
<p>It feels like people are moaning about privacy and lack of freedom just to moan.</p>
<p>Let's be honest here.</p>
<p>You don't have freedom today.</p>
<p>In my country, shops close early on Sundays so you can't just go out when you want. Places stop serving alcohol at 11pm. You can't buy cigarettes or alcohol until you reach a certain age. You can't drive without a licence. You can't live in a house without paying tax to the government. You can't leave the country if they don't want you to. You have to prove you're over age to access some websites. </p>
<p>Hell, there's even laws about what you can say now. You can't use hate speech or deny the Holocaust happening, and you can actually go to jail for a negative hotel review if you can't absolutely prove every single bit of it. That's literally speech being regulated.</p>
<p>So, it's nothing new.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to the vaccines, I take your point about soft coercion. It is. I can't deny that. I think I compared it earlier to smoking - that's getting less acceptable in society and its becoming harder to do it. That's a soft coercion to stop.</p>
<p>And this, in a very long roundabout way, brings me to my point.</p>
<p>I don't mind doing anything, as long as it has a benefit to my life. I don't mind any freedoms being restricted, as long as I think there's a gain, and I'm not harmed.</p>
<p>With the small silly examples of shops closing early, I can see there's a gain to the staff who get to go home and enjoy their weekend and I'm sure I can wait an extra day for milk. I can see no harm and I can see a benefit.</p>
<p>With the vaccines, I can see no harm. It's statistically safe, it's proven to protect you (there's huge data available now about areas with high vaccine uptake having zero hospitalisations and areas with low vaccine uptake having high hospitalisations, continuously repeated in many areas). I can see lots of benefits.</p>
<p>So, my line is - I will accept anything that I think improves my life. I strongly think vaccines do. I think lockdowns did as well, for the temporary time period it was for. </p>
<p>I think society as a whole believes that as well.</p>
<p>When "they" try and restrict freedoms too much, for example, if they one day tried to implement a rule that said "when you die, your bank accounts are emptied and given to the government", I'd protest because there's no benefit and there's harm to my family.</p>
<p>If they said "we're going to put your medical record online, with your name and address", I'd protest, because there's no benefit to me, only harm can come from that.</p>
<p>I've made up some examples, I'm sure you have better ones.</p>
<p>But I'm absolutely convinced that society understands where the line is, and they will determine what's acceptable and what's not. I believe vaccines are firmly in the acceptable category.</p>

        <p>This is where these conversations get difficult to have because there are a lot of branches and some people take issues with some and not others and have different views on each. </p>
<p>I guess to try and sum it up I think you have more faith than most that more good will be done with these things than bad. </p>
<p>All of these things you mentioned could be used for good and do for the most part....but that’s until they are not. Once humans decide to use these things for bad then it’s a world of hurt the further  you go down these roads, the harder it becomes to get back if that time comes.</p>
<p>I would argue that time always comes eventually. I don’t think history favours your worldview. Horrific shit always eventually happens and people always end up taken advantage of.</p>
<p>Now when it comes to “freedom” this is where I will agree with you to a certain extent. No one is ever 100% free, nor do I think anyone should have the freedom to do literally anything they want. </p>
<p>Personally I think I should have the freedom to what gets put in my body and I don’t think it’s right for people to exclude me from society in general if I decide I don’t want something in me. This is an example of a freedom that we use to have but is being taken away as we speak. </p>
<p>So freedom is a matter of degrees. </p>
<p>you used speech as an example, and I think it’s a great one. There is literally no reason to restrict people’s speech. And this is a clear overreach if you ask me. This is the kinda thing that makes me not trust these organizations because this doesn’t better my life or society in anyway and I would argue censoring people’s speech only leads to worse things. People can go to jail for saying certain things. Are you onboard with that? </p>
<p>I’m not a fundamentalist, and I don’t believe things have to be a certain way just because that’s the way they have been in the past. 
So I’m not against changing things for the better nor am I accepting of certain things just because they were accepted in the past. </p>
<p>It seems we just have different philosophies on this stuff. A lot of it you see as benign. I just don’t see it that way. What you see as a natural occurrence that common sense is fixing, I see as a plan being carried out and manipulated along the way. Maybe my view is wrong maybe it’s right and the same goes for you, that will come out In the wash. We all trust different sources and all have different levels of proof needed to convince us of our world views. A discussion like this is what we need more of and is much healthier than most of the shit getting flung around on the internet</p>

        <p>On the speech issue, I find it a tricky one. I feel like if I want to call you names, or the N word, or if I want to go on TV and deny the holocaust happened, or if I want to accuse someone of a crime, I should be in control of my voice and be allowed to say them.</p>
<p>But it is harmful to society. Why would I want to upset you? Why would I want to deliberately antagonise you? Why would I upset an entire race or group of people? Why should I ruin someone's life with an incorrect accusation?</p>
<p>So, I understand why saying certain things is against the law. It doesn't benefit society for me to say them and it only causes harm. I get it. I may not absolutely agree all the time but I get it.</p>
<p>On the medical issue, I just have trust in them. The alternative is to not trust them at all. If I get cancer, I don't want to refuse treatment. I want to trust them and I'm confident that listening to them will give me longer life than ignoring them. These guys have gone to school for 10 years, been working for ages, they are experts. I have no reason to not trust.</p>
<p>I take medicines every day. Simple things like paracetamol, aspirin, indigestion tablets, and I've no idea what's in them. I trust them.</p>
<p>If I was in an accident, and needed blood transfusion, or antibiotics, I'd be unconscious but I'd trust them to put the right stuff in my body to fix me.</p>
<p>I trust doctors to put anything in my body they deem necessary. They know stuff I don't know. How on earth can I overrule them? It'd be like me coming to your job and overruling you.</p>
<p>And honestly, the health experts put stuff in your body all the time without you knowing. For the last 50 years, all bread sold in shops has got extra vitamins, minerals and things like iron in it. This is different to home made bread and it is at the request of medical experts who want children to consume more of those vitamins. No one asked your permission for that.</p>
<p>To me, not having the vaccine is like the Doctors telling you that you should eat a healthy diet and you saying "fuck you doctors, you can't tell me what to do" and just eating burgers every day.</p>
<p>You're within your rights to do it, and no one will force a salad into you. But Jesus, why would you? You're only harming yourself. Why take a stand against something helpful?</p>
<p>I will be the first in the queue to protest against a loss of freedom, as soon as it reaches harmful levels. And me being free to ignore the vaccine and catch Covid isn't really the freedom I'm going to pick as the line being crossed.</p>
<p>I do understand your view. You're saying it's the start of a slippery slope. And maybe it is. And you might just be noticing it a little bit before I am. As our freedoms get eroded one by one, there will be a tipping point. I just don't think vaccines is that point.</p>

        <p>I wish everyone had your attitude toward these things.</p>
<p>On freedom of speech I agree with you on the point of accusing someone of a crime. That’s definitely not cool and I’m fine with doing something about that. As for the rest I don’t think that stuff should be censored. While I don’t agree with that other stuff being said such as hate speech, I still don’t think going to the lengths of censoring them in necessary. If we allow censoring for people’s feelings getting hurt then we are on another slippery slope because most people are fragile and get their feelings hurt over everything.</p>
<p>I kinda disagree on the medical aspect. I believe my health is my decision always. (Of course there is certain situations where I might not be able to make a decision but that’s a separate issue)</p>
<p>So even if something is objectively good for me I don’t feel someone else has the right to put it in me. They can suggest and hopefully give me honest answers to any questions I have but I feel like that’s where it ends. Any further and they are overstepping their boundaries. As for examples like the bread one you brought up. My feeling is if you have to put vitamins in it to begin with then it’s probably not the best option to eat anyway. I’m all for companies being able to sell what they want within reason but we have natural foods that can get us everything we need anyway. These should be options and we don’t need things added to them. Same with drinking water. Just clean it, no need to add things to it. </p>
<p>1 place we definitely disagree is on the “expert” thing. School no matter how long does not equal expert. I work in carpentry. We have people who come from trade school and don’t have a god damn clue what they are doing. They learn on the job. Doctors work much in the same way. The only thing I will say about doctors is that health related information changes rapidly, and I would find it hard to believe all these doctors are constantly staying on top of all of it. There is a reason there is the concept of a second opinion. Because a lot of health related knowledge is murky. There is so many factors that make up overall health and we have not got them all figured out yet. Here in Canada a study was just released that said 9000-24000 deaths per year are due to medical malpractice. That’s just I. This country. Worldwide numbers will be much bigger. So even “experts” can be wrong and make mistakes.</p>
<p>I will leave this here
 https://wsau.com/2021/06/08/immunologist-we-made-a-big-mistake/</p>
<p>This is a virologist from the university of Guelph. One of these experts that has gone to school. He is saying mistakes were made.</p>
<p>Now I don’t know if this is true, but if I were to go by your logic then I should trust him. Either trust him before that it was safe, or trust what he is saying now that they made a mistake.</p>
<p>My position is to not fully believe either because I just don’t know the truth either way.</p>
<p>We have to listen to ideas regardless of where they come from and assess them logically. If you did come to my job site like you mentioned and pointed something out to me. What if it’s true? Am I just supposed to ignore you just because I “know better” than you because I’m an expert? Or should I take in what you say and realize that you might be right about it?</p>
<p>I very much like the fact that you while disagreeing don’t seem to be on the side of forcing people to live a certain way. I think this is the biggest issue for me. My health=my choices is all I am asking for on this issue</p>

        <p>I think experts can be wrong, although there's an important distinction that I see a lot on this sub sometimes. Giving a medical opinion based on all available information isn't necessarily wrong. It might end up being proven wrong but it doesn't mean they were wrong to give the advice at that time.</p>
<p>Covid was brand new and information changed quickly. I think sometimes the trend of saying "this doctor said this back in March 2020" is a little unfair.</p>
<p>Obviously sometimes experts can be flat out wrong due to misreading data or jumping to the wrong conclusions. Humans are human. There's no denying that. A few experts being wrong doesn't necessarily invalidate the entire field of science though. And it doesn't mean that those same doctors can't be right this time.</p>
<p>I take your point about it being your choice. It is. I don't think doctors are going to come round to your house with a needle. You may get a few social pressures but I think that's as far as the forcing will go. I really don't think they will physically force you. So I think everyone accepts its your choice.</p>
<p>When I'm faced with a choice, I look at the options and try and figure out what's best for me. And I'm willing to bet you are in a similar position to me.</p>
<p>You don't have all the facts, all the data. We have snippets of it. You probably have a few articles, a few Facebook posts and a few reddit posts. We both see things that backs up our own opinions. That's how social media works. So I don't think either of us are qualified to make an informed decision. I don't think 99% of people are qualified to make a decision. We just don't know enough. I don't know how vaccines are made. I don't know what the ingredients are.</p>
<p>So, I have a choice between get it or not get it. I don't really know enough about either choice.</p>
<p>So, I look at who is on either side. On the side of "get it", there seems to be every reputable scientist in the world. On the other side, in my day to day life, the only people I encounter are the crazy ones who believe any old shit and this sub, and honestly, a lot of people in here seem insane.</p>
<p>So, just by looking at who is on both sides, it sways me towards getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>I also read what I can. The advantages of getting it sound reasonable. They make sense to me. Maybe it's better marketing. Who knows? Unless I go and study medicine, I won't know so I have to somehow form an opinion, and their explanation of the science makes sense.</p>
<p>I look at the reasons not to get it, and honestly, they don't make sense. Again, maybe it's just bad marketing on that side. But I read stuff, and it doesn't ring true.</p>
<p>Maybe its because its hard to read genuine objections to the vaccine without also reading insane theories, and I think that's something this sub needs to get better at. I don't think the crazies are filtered out very well.</p>
<p>But that's why I landed where I did. I read what I could, I listened to people that seemed reputable, and I instinctively thought one argument was more reasonable than the other.</p>
<p>But that's actually not the point. I actually think you'll probably get the vaccine if it's offered to you soon, or you might have even got it already. I get the feeling you're not anti vax, you're just anti force. And I think we agree on that.</p>
<p>I would happily agree with anyone on this sub who is anti force. I would hope they would all just get it without the need for force anyway.</p>

        <p>That's not how any of this went down. It was executed by a centralized group of very powerful people who used their media empires to brainwash people with scare tactics. They use that same media to silence any dissenting voices. And there are a LOT of dissenting voices.</p>

        <p>Not really. They are just following along with everyone else. There are of course some exceptions like <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-lockdown-sweden-broke-most-091518853.html">Sweden</a> (which is faring better than places that had lockdowns and mask mandates).</p>
<p>I called all this bullshit when I saw China doing lockdowns and other ineffective garbage. I was like "the rest of the world is going to follow suit so they don't look bad", and here we are. Many governments have also realized how easy it is to illicit compliance in their citizens and gain more control over them, so they are doing it for that reason.</p>
