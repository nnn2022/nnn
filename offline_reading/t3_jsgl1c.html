    <strong>A lot of things aren't provable. But the common statement that science for the last 100 years has been 100% in favor of mask usage is a outright lie.</strong>
    <p><p>I have been collecting scientific studies, and medical articles from pre 2020. I simply typed terms such as "surgical mask usage: or "cloth mask usage" and excluded 2020 results. So far I have found that there was no "universal conclusion" on cloth or even surgical masks. </p>

<p>These studies and articles are mixed. Some are in favor of masks, some are in favor of surgical but not cloth ones, and some are completely anti mask, while others say masks work but say reuse without decontamination(lets be real a lot of the public keeps them in their car and rarely washes them)makes them ineffective or even negatively effective. </p>
<p><strong>To conclude, I see scientists arguing all over the map. So we are left with the conclusion that in less than a year, we have cleared up a scientific debate that wasn't solved for decades, and now to even suggest that masks are ineffective is viewed the same as rejecting "germ theory", or "Science".</strong></p></p>

        <p>We’ve learned so much this year. </p>
<p>For example, virus pandemic planning that said that lockdowns wouldn’t work and should never be used was obviously wrong. </p>
<p>All science prior to 2020 was wrong as well. </p>
<p>Public health experts are now also experts on the economy. </p>
<p>And finally, only Covid deaths matter. All other deaths are of no consequence.</p>

        <p>WHO did an entire lit review just last year and concluded that masks had essentially zero value in preventing respiratory virus transmission. </p>
<p>But, you know, all of history, science, and biology poofed away in March.</p>

        <p>It just irritates me that in less than a year, as a subject of of study, effectiveness of cloth and surgical face coverings by the public has gone from “inconclusive”, to “Face coverings work, science. If you think they don’t you are denying science”. They are acting like to question masks is to question gravity or Newton’s laws of motion. </p>
<p>I don’t even care if people think masks work or don’t. Completely disregarding evidence showing that they don’t out of hand and refusing to even consider a alternative should scare you. </p>
<p>If it doesn’t I guess you believe that for 50+ years scientists didn’t have a single minded conclusion, and while governments and public health agencies were beating in their office door they came to a perfect conclusion all at once in less than 3 months and didn’t let any of these external agencies affect the studies or rush the results.</p>

        <p>We can't even publish new studies evaluating them unless they pledge to support a foregone conclusion. </p>
