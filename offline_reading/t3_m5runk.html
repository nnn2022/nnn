    <strong>Been training at the gym again for the past month and my mental health is better than ever !</strong>
    <p><p>Just as the title says, where I'm from in Europe we can finally go to the gym again, and the gym is PACKED, it makes me happy seeing people finally living again, I've trained at home as much as I could but it's so hard to stay motivated, and I actually plan on competing in bodybuilding competitions once this propaganda is over, no way I could achieve that with home workouts. </p>
<p>Even though the gym is almost full the cases are the same as they were when we were in total lockdown. But I know this is only a short victory, they will lock us in again, but I'm enjoying this small freesom, although we have a 22:00 curfew and we get fines if we go outside past that hour. </p>
<p>Apparently this deadly virus only works at night.</p></p>

        <p>Started back on March 1st here in Canada and exact same.  Same threat of another lockdown too.</p>
<p>Yep, mental health has improved drastically.  Quit smoking dope and drinking.  Can I work out at home?  Sure.  Will I continue to work out at home?  Sure.  But I work out with a trainer (best investment through all of this, no need to book a slot, dude is top notch) and there's something about being in that environment with access to all that equipment.  There's an endorphin release from lifting heavy.  There's a pleasure in the pain of sore muscles the next day.  It's very hard to achieve this at home unless you set up a prison rig with water jugs and what not.</p>

        <p>I have a decent home setup which works for maintaining muscle, but no way I can progress with it, especially since I live in a flat and I have to be careful about the noise and all that.   </p>
<p>You are absolutely right about the endorphin release at the gym, quite honestly I don't know how much longer I could have gone without it.</p>

        <p>I think gyms will never open again here in Germany.. Have you seen our politicians? I donâ€™t think they care a lot about sports and health.</p>

        <p>I went to the gym yesterday to sign up, but they were only allowing 10 people at a time and I'd be competing for slots 72 hours in advance. I ended up driving home and doing my best workout all year with just a dumbell and bodyweight. </p>
<p>I then found that there is an outdoor gym at a new community center for doing dips etc. And if I need to deadlift / squat once a week, I can pay $10 to use the facilities at a number of community centers in my town which is cheaper than the gym membership. </p>
<p>I agree though, I feel better than I have in a long time and I'm super optimistic about summer activities.</p>
