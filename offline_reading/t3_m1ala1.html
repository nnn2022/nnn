    <strong>It's kind of hilarious that the vaccine makes (young and healthy) people more sick than covid does.</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone else notice this? I'm hearing a lot of anecdotes from young and healthy people who get the vaccine, and it knocks then on their ass for several days, especially after the second shot. Yet it's always followed by the justification "but at least I didn't get covid" or worse "better than dying on a ventilator."</p>
<p>Did no one tell them that the vast majority of young and healthy little experience very little symptoms from covid, and often have no symptoms at all? Yet it seems like the vaccine is almost guaranteed to give you some pretty nasty side effects. I know several people who had covid (again i want to emphasize young and healthy people) and it sounded like pretty much no big deal.</p>
<p>Isn't that the definition of irony? Voluntarily getting sick to avoid a small chance of getting less sick? Not even just volunteering, but being excited and thrilled to do so. This is why I'd personally much rather risk getting covid than taking a vaccine.</p></p>

        <p>People on r/coronavirus daily discussion (which is fairly optimistic and not bad anymore) are absolutely euphoric to get their shots. It's almost as if they like the side effects, because they "know it's working".</p>

        <p>Most of my co-workers developed high fever from the vaccine and had to take sick-leave (hope that's the correct word? english is not my main language)   </p>
<p>Few just said they got sore arm. Two go really painful lymph nodes from the vaccine, one still have problems to move her arm and leg because of the swollen lymph nodes. And as I mentioned, maybe \~20 of the ppl I know got really sick from the vaccine.   </p>
<p>.. and they wonder why I don't take the vaccine for the virus that's pretty much causes just regular flu and I still have really small chance of catching the virus :D</p>

        <p>The answer is pretty obvious, though. Bad public health messaging from high up officials and fear mongering from the media.</p>
<p>They very successfully convinced people that this is a deadly virus that will kill people of any age with no discrimination. Very basic levels of research will show that it mainly only affects people 65+ and people with exceptionally poor health.</p>

        <p>Ok, so I am a Strong believer in masks and vaccines, I‚Äôm not here to be a dick or anything, I‚Äôm just curious about antimaskers/antivacs. Yes, younger people have very low death rates, but the vaccine is going to help older people not get sick. I have had 2 grandparents die from COVID so I am getting my shot ASAP so I can see the ones I have left. My 2 remaining grandparents have had there shots, but they still have a risk of getting COVID. I am worried that if I don‚Äôt get my shot, they might get it from me. If I get a shot and have a very low Rick of getting it, and they have a very low risk of getting it from there shot, maybe we be in each others presence for a while without wearing masks.</p>

        <p>nope, that‚Äôs a very agreeable viewpoint and I wish more people thought like you. Our issue isn‚Äôt with masks or vaccines, it‚Äôs with the personal choice of using them that‚Äôs the issue.</p>

        <p>If you have no symptoms you should be able to see your grams.  I‚Äôm sure they would rather see you shot or not.</p>

        <p>Thanks for being so civil, and sorry for your loss.</p>
<p>My main concern personally and I think echoes the general opinion of the sub is the sketchiness of the whole thing. I am staunchly anti-lockdown and that I would say is my main area of concern and reason I joined the sub, on a whole the past year has felt like something out of a Black Mirror episode and has left me with little to no trust of the government or the general COVID narrative in general. The vaccine is still technically in trial stage, is new experimental technology, and we have no clue of the long-term effects of taking it, there has already been concerns regarding blood disorders or fertility in young women. All of that paired with the fact the virus barely touches me, does not bode well with me wanting to take said vaccine in fact I would say the only reason I would ever receive it would be if I was strapped down and forced. </p>
<p>My question for you is - why are we ignoring everything we have ever known about our immune systems? As somebody who has been working the entirety of the pandemic and using public transport I am fairly sure my immune system is solid and I will already have antibodies. This gives me the same effect as the vaccine surely?</p>
<p>I support elderly people getting it, as COVID can be brutal to them, but I think young people would be far safer to catch COVID and gain natural immunity. It makes me very very skeptical how much the vaccine has been propagandised and advertised because quite frankly truth shouldn‚Äôt have to be advertised. The fact they are forcing it on us by discussing limiting freedoms of those who haven‚Äôt had it, makes it seem especially sinister to me.</p>
<p>Edit: just realised I didn‚Äôt touch on your anti-mask question. There‚Äôs been many studies and proof on the fact that masks don‚Äôt work so I think they are no more than another form of control and a way people can virtue signal by shaming non-maskers. There has been zero evidence of mask mandates decreasing case or death numbers.</p>

        <p>Another reason I want to get the vaccine is that my friend, the same age as me, was of a ventilator in the hospital for weeks because of COVID. He was so close to dieing and I don‚Äôt want to roll those dice. Yes, there aren‚Äôt any showing masks stoped the spread at all, but their are hundreds out there showing how masks work.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I think that it may be worth it for some older people to get the vaccine, but for most young people, the experience of COVID may be better.</p>
