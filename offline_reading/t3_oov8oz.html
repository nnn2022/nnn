    <strong>Guys I have a pretty serious question</strong>
    <p><p>I’m not trying to troll here I’m genuinely curious and trying to see both sides. I am a research biologist (I don’t work with vaccines or anything), but I do understand how an mRNA vaccine works and I do believe in vaccines. That’s not to say I don’t understand hesitations/skepticisms, and people who are sick/ have medical reasons not to get a vaccine should never be required to get one. </p>
<p>My question is: </p>
<p>All of the politicians and news anchors who are telling people not to get vaccinated, they are all vaxxed, all of them. When MTG refuses to tell anyone it’s because she is vaccinated. Does The fact that these people are vaccinated not change your minds at all? These are the same people who have politicized this virus since the beginning, presumably first in line to get that vaccine. I don’t know but to me   That’s a huge turn off. Not to say that the left hasn’t had their fair share of mishaps and stupid things said, and the CDC made some blunders, but I always thought it was better to follow science than it was to follow people telling you not to follow science. Idk. Maybe this is better off for CMV hahah but I just wanted to understand.</p>
<p>Thanks</p></p>

        <p>Do you really think most of us on this sub follow one political party over another, or that we would listen to a politician?</p>
<p>Most of us think government is the problem and all politicians are hypocritical scum.  </p>
<p>It doesn't matter what any talking head says; we have done our own risk calculus and just want to be left alone.</p>

        <p>Covid is a cold with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. Smart people aren't afraid of it. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. Most of the links below are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. Most of rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists/ scientists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>
<p>Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the Fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>
<p>Social  distancing doesn't work by MTI, literally says 6ft or 60ft doesn't matter.</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4</p>
<p>Masks dont work, especially the fabric ones:</p>
<p>These are just some articles about masks:  not .gov links or peer reviewed studies so take them with a grain of salt:</p>

<p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8966883/Masks-DONT-stop-spread-Covid-experts-criticise-troubling-lack-evidence.html</p>
<p>Now for the more medical journal type stuff on masks (most of these are referenced in the white paper in the next section, some say they work ans some say they don't...what they all show is the mandates are worthless)</p>

<p>In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>
<p>Comorbidities data: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities</a></p>

<p>Btw that translates to survival rates by age (if you get infected):</p>
<p>0-17                   99.998%</p>
<p>18-49                99.95%</p>
<p>50-64                99.4%</p>
<p>65+                     91%</p>

        <p>First, this isn't a vaccine, it's a gene therapy. </p>
<p>Second, and this is a big one for me personally, if someone wants immunity from prosecution for something that they make... (and this applies to ANYTHING), I'm not going to be a test subject for it.</p>
<p>Third, I don't give a fuck what talking heads on the TV say about anything.  Like lots of people here, I do the research and I follow the money, and I THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT EVERYTHING, and then I come to a rational conclusion.</p>
<p>In this case, why would I take an experimental gene therapy for a virus that I'm 99.95% not going to die from?  Hell, I don't take a yearly flu shot, and that's not gonna kill/ maim/ injure me (probably).</p>

        <p>First of all, how do we know they are actually vaccinated? Because they say they are? 
I'm sure there's people who won't get vaccinated that say they are just so they don't have to get into WHY they aren't. (I've done this)
 That's just my opinion though. </p>
<p>Honestly, I don't care what anyone does. If you want to get vaccinated, that's great, if you don't, that's great. </p>
<p>I'm just not comfortable with it right now (I might not ever be), so I'm not going to get it, and it doesn't matter what anyone who IS supposedly vaccinated tries to tell me or what they try to bribe me with. I'm not changing my mind until I'm ready to change my mind about it, if that ever even happens.</p>

<p>At least  do some research before you come here with dumb shit, whether you're real or not. Folks here are researched to the teeth. We have encountered every thought and counter thought that there is, both internally and externally. We are based af. If you don't get what's going on then you deserve whatever the future holds.</p>

        <p>If everyone jumped off a bridge, would you? Did you talk to your doctor before you got vaccinated? Or did you get vaccinated because some people on tv told you to or because they gave you a free donut if you took it? How can you not be skeptical of these vaccines ?</p>

        <p>What politicians have told people not to get vaxxed? I’m not aware of any.</p>
<p>Politicians either promote the vax, or don’t say anything either way about the vax. No politicians openly oppose the vax.</p>

        <p>There are people here who have been vaxed and they don’t care if others don’t.  I’ve done my research and it’s unnecessary.  If I were over 70 with comorbidities I might feel differently</p>

        <p>I already have natural immunity, live a solitary life, and I do not agree to allow anyone to make medical decisions on my behalf, unless I am unconscious, and the intervention will immediately prevent the cessation of my life. My risk from getting vaccinated is higher than my risk of reinfection, and hospitalization. I also avoid medication on a philosophical basis. I won't take aspirin, much less a new form of vaccination that is being pushed by the world. I also accept 100% responsibility for my choices. If this means that I lose years of my life, I will live it on my own terms, which to me at least, means really living. Once I hit retirement age, or if I develop diabetes, or if a new strain of the virus starts killing off 100% of the unvaccinated population, I'll reconsider. </p>
<p>Philosophically, reality is a chaotic system and even the most technical and professional analysis is subjective to a degree. We are all human, even the experts. Add the endless layers of political, social, and financial context of this situation and I simply cannot consent. This is an issue because from a procedural point of view, I must provide either implied or written consent to be vaccinated, and I cannot provide either. My conscience simply will not allow it. It feels in some ways like a Faustian bargain that I will regret.</p>
