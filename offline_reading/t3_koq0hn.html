    <strong>Normalcy bias going into 2021</strong>
    <p><p>TL:DR I want to encourage people to try and make sure they can take care of their mental and physical health in the event 2021 is characterised by lockdowns, though I recognise this may not occur, and to encourage ideas as to how to do so. </p>
<p>Reality is not like the movies, people tend to <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-frozen-calm-of-normalcy-bias-486764924">under react</a> to emergencies and look to others for confirmation before responding. A minority of people, or occasionally a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_psychogenic_illness">majority</a>, will overreact.</p>
<p>I think most of us who are against the new normal can agree that this government despotism is an emergency, and the rona itself is not. So in 2020 we have under reaction from the majority to tyranny and hysteria in response to a normal/ looks bad only if compared to the very mild 2019 cold and flu season. Unfortunately I would say I found it very difficult to not under react to the challenges that were imposed on us, not for lack of will but because of circumstance and the rapidity and lack of warning some of these insane restrictions were imposed on us. I managed to take reasonable care of my physical health but my mental health suffered dramatically.  </p>
<p>Going into 2021 I find myself on the side expecting this to drag on, to get worse. Not indefinitely, I am not any kind of doomer, but for 2021 and then to be a sword of Damocles available to be dropped on populations that were willing to accept this madness. I am self aware enough to recognise that I could be wrong, but on the balance I would rather err on the side of avoiding a repeat experience. Personally I am relocating somewhere that never imposed as strict a lockdown as were I am currently living as I am more concerned about being so constrained in my ability to act again than over reacting. </p>
<p>Most of you probably do not want to take as costly a measure, but I would encourage to try to think of reasonable steps and preparation that you can maintain as good a situation as possible. Maybe move in together with similar minded friends, rent a house instead of an apartment, set up a garage gym. I’m sure others can think of additional ideas more appropriate to a range of circumstances.</p></p>

        <p>Great post!! I think many of us were too confused to think straight in the beginning. I'm going to make sure 2021 is better for me, despite not knowing what will happen. At least I have an idea now and have somewhat mentally blocked what is going on.</p>

        <p>Excellent post. I’m pretty positive on 2021. I’m predicting near normality by the time summer comes. You’re gonna see some weirdos still wearing masks, but they’re gonna look dumber and dumber as time goes on. When no one is dying anymore, people will lose interest.</p>

        <p>I hope you are right that normality resumes. It was the willingness of people in the northern hemisphere to accept lockdowns going into another winter that changed my mind, but maybe third time is too many or the vaccine is enough to get over their panic without having to admit they were wrong.</p>

        <p>A very level-headed and positive approach, but my observation is that anyone who I can convince of anything... well, I've convinced them that they should follow my lead and leave the country as well.</p>
<p>The people who can't even understand how stupid replacing handshaking with elbow touching is...</p>
<p>Well, they simply cannot be convinced of anything. They cannot be convinced that a virus with a survival rate of 99.9% is not dangerous and they cannot be convinced that government tyranny is the real danger.</p>
<p>So, yeah, I'm getting the hell out of dodge because I too am completely unwilling to continue living in a country where the government thinks it is reasonable to place me under house arrest when there is a cold outbreak (or whatever other ludicrous reason it will come up with next) and among people who are cowardly fools that lick the very jackboots upon our necks.</p>

        <p>Lol I'm actually positive on 2021, I'm lined up to get vaccinated through work soon and life will get easier. Keep crying about tyranny, you've been presented multiple options to make this better and denied all of them. And you call us doomers lmao</p>

        <p>I think the disconnect between us is that most of us here reject the premise that anyone should rule over us and “give us options” in the first place. It’s okay that you’re scared, but don’t shame other people who aren’t, just to justify your own hysteria and lack of autonomy.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen many options to make this all better, and they’ve all failed catastrophically. Why? Because they simply don’t work. Not because a toddler didn’t wear a mask on a plane.</p>
